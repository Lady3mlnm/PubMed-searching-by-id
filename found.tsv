28758339	Mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 shift metabolism to mitochondrial respiration during aging.	lifespan, aging	2017-??-??	Replicative and chronological lifespan are two different modes of cellular aging. Chronological lifespan is defined as the duration during which quiescent normal cells retain their capacity to re-enter the proliferative cycle. This study investigated whether changes in metabolism occur during aging of quiescent normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) and the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Bioenergetics measurements were taken in quiescent NHFs from younger (newborn, 3-day, 5-month, and 1-year) and older (58-, 61-, 63-, 68-, and 70-year) healthy donors as well as NHFs from the same individual at different ages (29, 36, and 46 years). Results show significant changes in cellular metabolism during aging of quiescent NHFs: Old NHFs exhibit a significant decrease in glycolytic flux and lactate levels, and increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP levels compared to young NHFs. Results from the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test show that old NHFs with a lower Bioenergetic Health Ind…
28624737	Optical properties of the human lens constituents.	aging	2017-08-??	The absorption and fluorescence properties of the metabolomic (MET), water-soluble and urea-soluble protein fractions from the middle-age, aged, and cataractous human lenses have been measured. At 280nm and 300nm the major lens absorbers are crystallins, which absorb more than 90% of light in the UV-B region (280-315nm). In middle-aged lenses, the absorption at 360nm is mostly provided by UV filters contained in the MET fraction. With aging, and especially with the cataract development, the absorption of MET fraction in UV-A region (315-400nm) decreases due to the drop of the UV filter concentration, while the absorption of protein fractions increases due to the accumulation of post-translational modifications. Consequently, the contribution of the MET fraction into the total lens absorption at 360nm decays from 63% in middle-aged lenses to 25% in aged lenses to 3% in cataractous lenses. The fluorescence yield of the MET fraction from cataractous lenses also significantly increases. Th…
22834969	Human serum metabolic profiles are age dependent.	aging	2012-12-??	Understanding the complexity of aging is of utmost importance. This can now be addressed by the novel and powerful approach of metabolomics. However, to date, only a few metabolic studies based on large samples are available. Here, we provide novel and specific information on age-related metabolite concentration changes in human homeostasis. We report results from two population-based studies: the KORA F4 study from Germany as a discovery cohort, with 1038 female and 1124 male participants (32-81 years), and the TwinsUK study as replication, with 724 female participants. Targeted metabolomics of fasting serum samples quantified 131 metabolites by FIA-MS/MS. Among these, 71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in women/men (BMI adjusted). We further identified a set of 13 independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6 × 10(-04) to 7.8 × 10(-42) , α(corr) = 0.004). Eleven of these 13 metabolites were replicated in the TwinsUK study, including seven meta…
3299702	Human aging: usual and successful.	aging	1987-07-10	Research in aging has emphasized average age-related losses and neglected the substantial heterogeneity of older persons. The effects of the aging process itself have been exaggerated, and the modifying effects of diet, exercise, personal habits, and psychosocial factors underestimated. Within the category of normal aging, a distinction can be made between usual aging, in which extrinsic factors heighten the effects of aging alone, and successful aging, in which extrinsic factors play a neutral or positive role. Research on the risks associated with usual aging and strategies to modify them should help elucidate how a transition from usual to successful aging can be facilitated.
29266515	Altered macromolecular pattern and content in the aging human brain.	aging	2018-??-??	The resonances originating from proteins underlie those of metabolites in brain  H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. These resonances have different physical properties from those of metabolites, such as shorter T and T relaxation time constants. The age dependence of the macromolecular pattern and content in the human brain was investigated with a focus on adults over 66 years of age using ultrahigh-field in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Eighteen young and 23 cognitively normal older adults were studied at 7 T. Metabolite spectra were acquired in the occipital cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex with single-voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) spectroscopy in 14 young and 20 older adults. Macromolecular spectra were acquired in the occipital cortex using an inversion recovery STEAM sequence in four young and three older adults. The macromolecular pattern was apparent over the 0.5-4.5-ppm range in the inversion recovery spectra and the 0.5-2-ppm range in…
26198148	Noncoding Transcriptional Landscape in Human Aging.	aging	2016-??-??	Aging is a universal phenomenon in metazoans, characterized by a general decline of the organism physiology associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Aging of an organism correlates with a decline in function of its cells, as shown for muscle, immune, and neuronal cells. As the DNA content of most cells within an organism remains largely identical throughout the life span, age-associated transcriptional changes must be achieved by epigenetic mechanisms. However, how aging may impact on the epigenetic state of cells is only beginning to be understood. In light of a growing number of studies demonstrating that noncoding RNAs can provide molecular signals that regulate expression of protein-coding genes and define epigenetic states of cells, we hypothesize that noncoding RNAs could play a direct role in inducing age-associated profiles of gene expression. In this context, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of gene expression might be important for …
27988482	Toward a More Comprehensive Concept of Successful Aging: Disability and Care Needs.	aging	2017-03-01	Rowe and Kahn's model of Successful Aging 2.0 argues that changing environmental settings, societal policies, and individual life styles will lead to a significant extension of healthy life years. Recent epidemiological research, however, confirms the dilemma that the ongoing extension of life expectancy prolongs not only the years in good health but also those in poor health. We see it as a major limitation that Rowe and Kahn's model is not able to cover the emerging linkage between increasing life expectation and aging with disability and care needs. Therefore, we suggest a set of propositions towards a more comprehensive model of successful aging which captures desirable living situations including for those who grow old with disabilities and care needs. We describe individual, environmental, and care related strategies and resources for autonomy and quality of life when facing disabilities and care needs in late life, putting emphasis on inter-individual differences and social ineq…
26511272	Aging in Precarious Circumstances: Do Positive Views on Aging Make a Difference?	aging	2017-??-01	Purpose of the study: Precariousness, defined as low income combined with lack of security for retirement, can influence the way people grow old and result in health inequalities in old age.    Design and methods: A sequential mixed methods approach was used to identify differences in behavioral (physical activity), social (social network), and psychological resources (positive views on aging) that middle-aged individuals from both precarious and financially secure backgrounds use in preparation for positive aging and keep high levels of health and well-being. It was investigated whether positive views on aging can compensate the detrimental association of a lack of resources with health and well-being in midlife. Data from the German Aging Survey (N = 1,992 in the secure group, N = 240 in the precarious group) were analyzed to understand the relationship between resources on the one hand and health and well-being on the other, as well as to compare the strategies of individuals with p…
25620575	A new hypothesis of aging.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2015-03-??	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: There are over 300 hypotheses of aging, but none of them has enough predictive power to explain most experiments and observations on this process. On the basis of a critical analysis of the most relevant data on aging, especially on the factors that influences its rhythm, we present a new hypothesis, as well as the way the hypothesis' predictions explain some of the phylogenetic implications of the aging process.    METHODS: The hypothesis starts from a new, biochemical view on evolution and the behavior of living matter. According to this view, life is a fabric of chemical reactions that sustain each other. Reactants and energy support are needed for these reactions to take place in a cell. Given this, aging stems from a leftward shift of the global equilibrium of some biochemical reactions involved in cell differentiation and repair, which take place at a high level during the organism's growth period. In time, for species with evident aging, some reactions los…
24155214	Motor function is associated with 1,25(OH)(2)D and indices of insulin-glucose dynamics in non-diabetic older adults.	aging	2014-06-??	BACKGROUND: Advancing age is accompanied by changes in metabolic characteristics, such as reduced insulin sensitivity and low levels of vitamin D, which may exacerbate age-related declines in physical function.    AIMS: The aim of the present study was to determine the associations between insulin-glucose dynamics, vitamin D metabolites, and performance on a battery of motor tasks in healthy, non-diabetic older adults.    METHODS: Sixty-nine community-dwelling men and women (65-90 years) were recruited. Insulin-glucose dynamics were determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and vitamin D metabolites were measured. Motor function was characterized by the time to walk 500 m, chair-rise time, lower body strength, dorsiflexor steadiness and endurance time, and muscle coactivation.    RESULTS: Significant unadjusted correlations were found between insulin-glucose dynamics and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] with walk time, strength, steadiness, endurance time, and muscle act…
26463762	Energetics of Aging and Frailty: The FRADEA Study.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) decrease with aging, but it is not known whether frailty modulates this association. We hypothesize that RMR and TDEE values are similar between younger and older nonfrail older adults, whereas they are lower in older prefrail and frail compared with younger adults.    METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the FRADEA study, Albacete (Spain), including 402 participants (213 women) older than 70 years (mean age 76 years; range 70-91), was conducted. Estimated RMR (eRMR), oxygen consumption (VO2), expired volume (Ve), and respiratory frequency (RF) were determined using indirect calorimetry; TDEE was determined with the Calcumed instrument; and fat-free mass was determined by bioimpedanciometry. General linear models were used for analysis.    RESULTS: Mean TDEE was 1,889 (SD 470) kcal and eRMR was 1,071 (SD 323) kcal. Both TDEE (B = -24 kcal/day; 95% confidence interval: -35.4 to -14.2; p < .001) and eRMR…
28111190	Increased sensitivity to age-related differences in brain functional connectivity during continuous multiple object tracking compared to resting-state.	aging	2017-??-01	Age-related differences in cognitive agility vary greatly between individuals and cognitive functions. This heterogeneity is partly mirrored in individual differences in brain network connectivity as revealed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggesting potential imaging biomarkers for age-related cognitive decline. However, although convenient in its simplicity, the resting state is essentially an unconstrained paradigm with minimal experimental control. Here, based on the conception that the magnitude and characteristics of age-related differences in brain connectivity is dependent on cognitive context and effort, we tested the hypothesis that experimentally increasing cognitive load boosts the sensitivity to age and changes the discriminative network configurations. To this end, we obtained fMRI data from younger (n=25, mean age 24.16±5.11) and older (n=22, mean age 65.09±7.53) healthy adults during rest and two load levels of continuous multiple obje…
26973114	Object individuation and compensation in healthy aging.	aging	2016-04-??	Theories on neural compensation suggest that aged participants overactivate the brain areas involved in a task to compensate for the age-related decline. In this electrophysiological study, we investigated the temporal locus of neural overactivation in aging during multiple target processing. We measured performance and three event-related brain potential responses (N1, N2pc, and contralateral delay activity) in young and old adults, while they enumerated a variable number (1-4) of targets presented in an easy (distractor absent) or difficult (distractor present) condition. The main results indicated that although N2pc (∼200 ms) increased in amplitude in the distractor-present condition in the young group, no modulation occurred for the old group. Old participants were associated with larger N2pc amplitudes than young participants in the distractor-absent condition, where both groups had comparable levels of accuracy. These effects were not present for N1 and contralateral delay activi…
29244847	Cognitive failures in late adulthood: The role of age, social context and depressive symptoms.	aging	2017-??-??	The incidence of self-reported cognitive failures among older adults may be an index of successful cognitive aging. However, self-reported cognitive failures are biased by variation in depressive symptomatology. This study examined age-related and socio-cultural context effects on cognitive failures while controlling for depressive symptoms. Both overall and specific factors of cognitive failures were determined. A further goal was to investigate the relationship between working memory and cognitive efficiency measures and cognitive failures. One hundred and thirty-nine cognitively healthy adults were recruited from two populations known to differ in their dispositions toward cognitive failures and depressive symptoms (Sardinia and northern Italy). The participants were assigned to Young Old (65-74 years old), Old (75-84 years of age) or Oldest Old (≥85 years of age) groups, and individually presented with a test battery including the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Centre for Ep…
28872043	Representations of their own sexuality and aging body by old people: phenomenological and psychodynamic approach.	aging	2017-09-01	The sexuality of the elderly is rarely mentioned in general medicine although it holds an important place in many old people's life, and sexual well-being is a part of the global well-being according to the World Health Organization. To explore the representations of their own sexuality and aging body by the elderly. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in 15 healthy elderly people over 65 years of age, living at home. In-depth interviews were transcribed and submitted to qualitative content using a phenomenological and a psychodynamic analysis. The phenomenological approach allows to explore the meaning and significance of the sexuality of older people (their representations and individual experience). The psychodynamic approach allows an analysis of defense mechanisms in verbal and nonverbal behavior. Some elderly maintain a view of their sexuality in accordance with the societal standards existing before the sexual liberalization following the events of May 68 in Franc…
24457528	Serum profiling of healthy aging identifies phospho- and sphingolipid species as markers of human longevity.	aging	2014-01-??	As centenarians well represent the model of healthy aging, there are many important implications in revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms behind such successful aging. By combining NMR metabonomics and shot-gun lipidomics in serum we analyzed metabolome and lipidome composition of a group of centenarians with respect to elderly individuals. Specifically, NMR metabonomics profiling of serum revealed that centenarians are characterized by a metabolic phenotype distinct from that of elderly subjects, in particular regarding amino acids and lipid species. Shot- gun lipidomics approach displays unique changes in lipids biosynthesis in centenarians, with 41 differently abundant lipid species with respect to elderly subjects. These findings reveal phospho/sphingolipids as putative markers and biological modulators of healthy aging, in humans. Considering the particular actions of these metabolites, these data are suggestive of a better counteractive antioxidant capacity and a well-dev…
30411727	Normal patterns of regional brain <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in normal aging.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Normal aging alters the brain function even in the absence of recognizable structural changes, which can be detected using modern in vivo functional imaging modalities such as fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET) scan. It is highly important to recognize normal age-dependent changes in order to correctly diagnose pathologic states. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the age-related changes in regional brain F-FDG uptake in normal healthy population.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was part of the cardiovascular molecular calcification assessed by F-sodium fluoride (NaF) (CAMONA) PET/computed tomography (CT) study. This study was approved by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01724749). Forty normal healthy subjects were prospectively recruited in group A (22-32 years) and B (56-75 years) and underwent F-FDG PET/CT. Static images were obtained 180 minutes following F-FD…
25468185	Social cognition in schizophrenia and healthy aging: differences and similarities.	aging	2014-12-??	UNLABELLED: Social cognition is impaired in schizophrenia but it is not clear whether this is specific for the illness and whether emotion perception is selectively affected. To study this we examined the perception of emotional and non-emotional clues in facial expressions, a key social cognitive skill, in schizophrenia patients and old healthy individuals using young healthy individuals as reference. Tests of object recognition, visual orientation, psychomotor speed, and working memory were included to allow multivariate analysis taking into account other cognitive functions    RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients showed impairments in recognition of identity and emotional facial clues compared to young and old healthy groups. Severity was similar to that for object recognition and visuospatial processing. Older and younger healthy groups did not differ from each other on these tests. Schizophrenia patients and old healthy individuals were similarly impaired in the ability to automaticall…
28510785	The impact of leisure on mental health of Sardinian elderly from the 'blue zone': evidence for ageing well.	longevity	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND: There has been scientific interest in the Sardinia population for a number of years and for a variety of reasons, including its extreme longevity. This is especially prevalent in the central-eastern region of the island, where a blue zone region has been precisely delineated.    AIMS: The present study examines the influence of leisure activities on psychological well-being and depressive symptoms in elderly individuals living in the blue zone region of inner Sardinia.    METHODS: Eighty-three participants were recruited according to strict inclusion criteria to ensure their cognitive and residency status. Individuals were assigned to either old (70-79 years) or very old (≥80 years) groups, and were administered a test battery to determine their socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, perceived physical health, and self-perceived well-being and depressive symptoms.    RESULTS: The primary findings indicate that participation in leisure activities positively influen…
23273984	The aging ovary--the poor granulosa cells.	aging	2013-01-??	The development of a competent oocyte intimately depends on the maintenance of energetic homeostasis in the ovarian and follicular microenvironment. On this basis, it is very likely that the oocyte ages as the ovary ages. Starting from the molecular evidence for energy perturbations in the whole ovary, we review current knowledge on the involvement of endogenous highly reactive metabolites in follicle aging. The first part provides an update of recent findings that confirm the key role of oxidative stress in aged granulosa cells. The second part focuses on studies providing evidence for the implication of advanced glycation end product (AGE) in aging reproductive dysfunction. With their prolonged half-life and ability to act as signaling molecules AGEs may gradually accumulate in the ovary and potentiate the wide spatiotemporal spread of oxidative stress. Clinical evidence for this view supports the hypothesis that AGE is a good candidate as a predictive marker and therapeutic target i…
24793646	Antecedents of Attitudes to Aging: A Study of the Roles of Personality and Well-being.	aging	2016-04-??	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Little research has examined factors that contribute to the formation of attitudes toward one's own aging. The current study aimed to examine personality as defined by the Five-Factor model of personality as an antecedent of attitudes, while taking into account demographic and health factors known to be relevant to such attitudes.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants aged 60 years or older (N = 421) were part of a longitudinal study of health and well-being in Australia, and completed a postal survey comprising measures of personality, the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire, the SF-12 health survey, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale.    RESULTS: Higher levels of neuroticism were associated with less positive attitudes toward old age as a time of psychological growth, and higher extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of less negative attitudes toward psychosocial loss. Baseline measures of self-reported mental and physical health, as well as ch…
28982708	The Reduction of Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Gray Matter Volume Correlates with Loss of Economic Rationality in Aging.	aging	2017-??-06	The population of people above 65 years old continues to grow, and there is mounting evidence that as humans age they are more likely to make errors. However, the specific effect of neuroanatomical aging on the efficiency of economic decision-making is poorly understood. We used whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis to determine where reduction of gray matter volume in healthy female and male adults over the age of 65 years correlates with a classic measure of economic irrationality: violations of the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference. All participants were functionally normal with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ranging between 26 and 30. While our elders showed the previously reported decline in rationality compared with younger subjects, chronological age per se did not correlate with rationality measures within our population of elders. Instead, reduction of gray matter density in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex correlates tightly with irrational behavior. Intere…
29654977	Identification of Isomeric Aspartate residues in βB2-crystallin from Aged Human Lens.	aging	2018-07-??	Many post-translational modifications such as oxidation, deamidation and isomerization of amino acid residues occur in lens proteins with aging. One such modification, isomerization of aspartate in lens α-crystallin, has been well studied by amino acid enantiomer analysis and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS can quickly and easily identify D- and L-amino acid-containing peptides without purification of lens protein mixtures. However, this method has a weak point in that isomeric peptides of major components are detected predominantly, while those from minor proteins such as β- and γ-crystallins have not been fully determined. Therefore, the isomerization of amino acid residues in β- and γ-crystallin families has been little studied. To solve those problems and detect the isomerization of Asp residues in lens βB2-crystallin, the main component of the β-crystallin family, here we have developed steps for sample fractionation before d/l analysis based on either LC-MS/MS or amino acid derivatization to …
19853023	Gender- and age-dependent changes in nucleoside levels in the cerebral cortex and white matter of the human brain.	aging	2010-04-05	Nucleosides are neuromodulators that participate in various neuronal functions in the brain. In previous studies, we described regional differences in the concentrations of nucleosides and their derivatives in the human brain. To better understand the functions of nucleosides in the central nervous system, we investigated gender- and age-dependent changes in the levels of nucleosides and their metabolites. The concentrations of uridine, inosine, guanosine and adenosine as well as uracil, hypoxanthine and xanthine were measured in the frontal cortex and white matter of post-mortem brain tissue samples of middle-aged and old men as well as women. The average in vivo concentrations calculated from the 40 samples investigated (regardless of anatomical locations, gender or age; mean +/- S.E.M.) were as follows (pmol/mg wet tissue weight): 9.7 +/- 0.8 adenosine, 85.8 +/- 3.9 inosine, 14.3 +/- 0.9 guanosine, 37.3 +/- 1.8 uridine, 8.9 +/- 0.6 uracil, 63.3 +/- 2.1 hypoxanthine and 38.7 +/- 1.5 …
24098589	Faster metabolite (1)H transverse relaxation in the elder human brain.	aging	2013-??-??	(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is unique among imaging modalities because signals from several metabolites are measured during a single examination period. Each metabolite reflects a distinct intracellular process. Furthermore transverse (T2 ) relaxation times probe the viability of the cell microenvironment, e.g., the viscosity of the cellular fluids, the microscopic susceptibility distribution within the cells, and the iron content. In this study, T2s of brain metabolites were measured in the occipital lobe of eighteen young and fourteen elderly subjects at a field strength of 4 tesla. The T2s of N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, and total choline were 23%, 16% and 10% shorter in elderly than in young subjects. The findings of this study suggest that noninvasive detection of T2 provides useful biological information on changes in the cellular microenvironment that take place during aging.
24524960	Healthy ageing and home: the perspectives of very old people in five European countries.	aging	2014-04-??	This paper reports on in-depth research, using a grounded theory approach, to examine the ways in which very old people perceive healthy ageing in the context of living alone at home within urban settings in five European countries. This qualitative study was part of a cross-national project entitled ENABLE-AGE which examined the relationship between home and healthy ageing. Interviews explored the notion of healthy ageing, the meaning and importance of home, conceptualisations of independence and autonomy and links between healthy ageing and home. Data analysis identified five ways in which older people constructed healthy ageing: home and keeping active; managing lifestyles, health and illness; balancing social life; and balancing material and financial circumstances. Older people reflected on their everyday lives at home in terms of being engaged in purposeful, meaningful action and evaluated healthy ageing in relation to the symbolic and practical affordances of the home, contextua…
26410670	Age related changes in ocular motor testing in healthy subjects.	aging	2015-??-??	The aim of the present study was the investigation of age influenced changes in ocular motility testing in healthy subjects. Two hundred and fifty subjects between 18 and 70 years old were enrolled in a prospective study. Study population was divided in 5 groups of 50 subjects each (group A: 18-30 years old, group B: 31-40 years old, group C: 41-50 years old, group D: 51-60 years old and group E: 61-70 years old). Ocular motility was recorded by video-oculography and age related normative data were obtained with respect to: a) gain and slow phase velocity of smooth pursuit tracking, b) latency, velocity and accuracy of saccade eye movements and c) gain and slow phase velocity of optokinetic eye movements. The influence of age on all parameters was examined by one-way ANOVA. A statistically significant difference was found in all parameters analyzed for smooth pursuit test, saccade eye movements and optokinetic eye movements in between groups. In conclusion, aging influences the majorit…
25804360	Cortical gyrification and its relationships with cortical volume, cortical thickness, and cognitive performance in healthy mid-life adults.	aging	2015-??-??	Across species, greater cortical gyrification, or folding of the cortex, has been shown to be associated with higher cognitive abilities and is thought to reflect an evolutionary process aimed at maximizing the number of cerebral computational units while minimizing the energy and communication costs of larger brains. Relatively little is known about the significance of individual variation in gyrification in humans and how it relates to other aspects of cerebral structure and function. In the current study, we examined relationships between cortical gyrification and (i) cortical volume, (ii) cortical thickness, and (iii) executive functions. Participants were middle-aged healthy adults (44-48 years old, n=396) in a community-based sample. T1-weighted 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired in a Fast Field Echo sequence. Cortical gyrification, volume, and thickness were measured through the semi-automated software FreeSurfer. Results showed that cortical gyrificati…
30738080	Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in centenarians and young adults shows a common signature across genotypically non-related populations.	longevity, aging	2019-??-??	Gut microbiota is among the factors that may be involved in healthy aging. Broader and geographically spread studies on gut microbiota of centenarians can help in identifying a common signature of longevity. We identified an endogamous Indian population with high centenarian prevalence. Here, we compared the gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolites of a centenarians group (˜100 years) with young people (25-45 years) of the region with the high centenarian prevalence and the nearby region of low centenarian prevalence to decipher microbial-related longevity signatures. Also, we compared our results with publicly available datasets of similar groups including 125 centenarians from three countries (Italy, Japan, China). Our comparative analysis resulted in higher biodiversity within Ruminococcaceae in centenarians, with respect to younger adults, irrespective of their nationality. We observed bacterial signatures that are common among extremely old people of different nationality.…
29587243	Serum calcium levels and neuropsychological performance in depression and matched healthy controls: Reversal of correlation a marker of the aging cognitive clock?	aging	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with cognitive impairment, that might be related to disturbed calcium homeostasis. Calcium-related processes have also been implicated in age related cognitive decline. Since serum calcium and brain interstitial fluids maintain long-term equilibrium under normal physiological states, serum calcium levels could affect neuronal and hence cognitive function. High serum calcium has been associated with cognitive decline in geriatric populations, whereas evidence for MDD and healthy populations is less consistent.    METHODS: Differences in neuropsychological (NPS) performance and their relationship with serum calcium (total, ionized, total to ionized ratio) in (partially) remitted MDD patients (n = 59) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 59) individually matched for age, gender and education (age-range 19-60 years) were examined. Modulation of study parameters and their interaction by the factor age was investigated, with subgroups young…
24977926	Variability and predictors of urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites during early childhood.	aging	2014-??-??	The variability and predictors of urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in preschool-aged children have not been thoroughly examined. Additionally, the impact of temporal changes in the use and restriction of phthalates in children's products has not been assessed. Our objective was to identify demographic, behavioral, and temporal predictors of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in young children. Between 2004 and 2011, we collected up to five urine samples from each of 296 children participating in a prospective birth cohort during annual study visits at ages 1-5 years. We used linear mixed models to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), a measure of within-individual reproducibility, and identify demographic predictors of urinary phthalate metabolites. We used multivariable linear regression to examine cross-sectional relationships between food packaging or personal care product use and phthalate metabolites measured at age 5 years. Across annual m…
10705043	The effects of aging on enzyme activities and metabolite concentrations in skeletal muscle from sedentary male and female subjects.	aging	2000-02-??	Aging affects the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscle, in particular the glycolytic and respiratory capacities. The purpose of this study was to quantify biochemical alterations due to aging in muscular metabolic capacity in human skeletal muscles in sedentary subjects. The activities of various marker enzymes and metabolites related to glycolysis, Krebs' cycle and the electron transfer chain and high energy phosphate compounds were measured in muscle biopsies from the rectus abdominis, vastus lateralis, and gluteus maximus muscles of 76 sedentary subjects (32 males and 44 females) between 15 and 91 yr. No significant differences between males and females were found, but changes related to age were: a decrease in hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in the rectus abdominis; a decrease in citrate synthase activity and citrate in the vastus lateralis; an increase in pyruvate kinase activity and a decrease in ATP and creatine phosphate concentrations in the gluteus maximus. T…
29772765	Protein Carbamylation: A Marker Reflecting Increased Age-Related Cell Oxidation.	aging	2018-05-17	Carbamylation is a post-translational modification of proteins that may partake in the oxidative stress-associated cell damage, and its increment has been recently proposed as a "hallmark of aging". The molecular mechanisms associated with aging are related to an increased release of free radicals. We have studied whether carbamylated proteins from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects are related to oxidative damage and aging, taking into account the gender and the immune profile of the subjects. The study was performed in healthy human volunteers. The detection of protein carbamylation and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels was evaluated using commercial kits. The immune profile was calculated using parameters of immune cell function. The results show that the individuals from the elderly group (60⁻79 years old) have increased carbamylated protein and MDA levels. When considered by gender, only men between 60 and 79 years old showed significantly increased carbamylated proteins and MDA …
27800690	Order of aging of major human organs or systems and evaluation of health status based on aging.	aging	2017-03-??	To determine the functional age of an individual, a quantitative system for the assessment of aging status was developed in the present study. A total of 1579 subjects were selected randomly from patients undergoing physical examination. The index of organic mild impairment (IOMI) and IOMI corrected for age (COMI) were calculated. By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the IOMIs of younger and elderly subjects, a cutoff value for COMI of 30% was obtained. About 95% of <30-year-old subjects were healthy. These data suggest that organs and systems reflect the aging status of an individual and may be a useful tool for evaluating health status.
29571628	Differences in α-Crystallin isomerization reveal the activity of protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) in the nucleus and cortex of human lenses.	aging	2018-??-??	Although it is well-known that protein turnover essentially stops in mature lens fiber cells, mapping out the ensuing protein degradation and its effects on lens function over time remains challenging. In particular, isomerization is a common, spontaneous post-translational modification that occurs over long timescales and generates products invisible to most analytical methods. Nevertheless, isomerization can significantly impact protein structure, function, and solubility, which are all necessary to maintain clarity and proper refractive index within the lens. Herein, we examine the degree of isomerization occurring in crystallin proteins in the human eye lens as a function of both age and location within the lens. A novel mass spectrometric technique leveraging radical chemistry enables detailed characterization of proteins extracted from the cortex and nucleus of the lens. It is observed that the degree of isomerization increases significantly between the cortex and nucleus and bet…
26072480	Exploring the structure and function of temporal networks with dynamic graphlets.	aging	2015-06-15	MOTIVATION: With increasing availability of temporal real-world networks, how to efficiently study these data? One can model a temporal network as a single aggregate static network, or as a series of time-specific snapshots, each being an aggregate static network over the corresponding time window. Then, one can use established methods for static analysis on the resulting aggregate network(s), but losing in the process valuable temporal information either completely, or at the interface between different snapshots, respectively. Here, we develop a novel approach for studying a temporal network more explicitly, by capturing inter-snapshot relationships.    RESULTS: We base our methodology on well-established graphlets (subgraphs), which have been proven in numerous contexts in static network research. We develop new theory to allow for graphlet-based analyses of temporal networks. Our new notion of dynamic graphlets is different from existing dynamic network approaches that are based on…
25559504	Optical coherence tomography measurements of choroidal thickness in healthy eyes: correlation with age and axial length.	aging	2015-01-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) in healthy eyes using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and provide correlations between age and axial length.    PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enhanced depth SD-OCT imaging was performed with Cirrus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) instruments. CT was measured from the outer limit of the retinal pigment epithelium to the inner surface of the sclera.    RESULTS: The study enrolled 155 patients, with at least 20 in each decade between 22 and 89 years old. Mean axial length was 23.6 mm. Mean Heidelberg subfoveal CT was 286 µm. The correlation between Heidelberg and Zeiss subfoveal CT measurements was strong (r = .978) and significant (P < .001). Mean subfoveal CT was 7.7 µm thinner by Heidelberg versus Cirrus (P < .001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (P < .001), axial length (P = .001), and sex (P = .025) were significan…
22081680	The effect of age and cerebral ischemia on diffusion-weighted proton MR spectroscopy of the human brain.	aging	2012-03-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DW-MRS is a promising tool for the noninvasive identification of the cellular response to cerebral ischemia. To date, the potential confounding effects of aging and the stage of ischemia are unknown. We, therefore, examined the cross-sectional effects of age and different stages of cerebral ischemia on the diffusion of brain metabolites.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ADCs of 3 major metabolites, including Cho, Cr, and NAA were measured by DW-MRS in healthy younger (n = 26, 24 ± 2.2 years of age) and older (n = 17, 63 ± 7.0 years of age) adults, as well as in patients with acute (n = 7, 57 ± 4.0 years of age) and subacute (n = 12, 62 ± 7.8 years of age) cerebral ischemia.    RESULTS: Compared with younger adults, healthy older adults presented with significantly reduced ADC values of NAA (P = .000052), Cr (P = .000018), and Cho (P = .00075). Meanwhile, the ADC values of NAA (F(2,36) = 6.057, P = .006), Cr (F(2,36) = 5.634, P = .008), and Cho (F(2,36) = 8.167, P =…
26168237	Coordinated Expression of Phosphoinositide Metabolic Genes during Development and Aging of Human Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND: Phosphoinositides, lipid-signaling molecules, participate in diverse brain processes within a wide metabolic cascade.    HYPOTHESIS: Gene transcriptional networks coordinately regulate the phosphoinositide cascade during human brain Development and Aging.    METHODS: We used the public BrainCloud database for human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to examine age-related expression levels of 49 phosphoinositide metabolic genes during Development (0 to 20+ years) and Aging (21+ years).    RESULTS: We identified three groups of partially overlapping genes in each of the two intervals, with similar intergroup correlations despite marked phenotypic differences between Aging and Development. In each interval, ITPKB, PLCD1, PIK3R3, ISYNA1, IMPA2, INPPL1, PI4KB, and AKT1 are in Group 1, PIK3CB, PTEN, PIK3CA, and IMPA1 in Group 2, and SACM1L, PI3KR4, INPP5A, SYNJ1, and PLCB1 in Group 3. Ten of the genes change expression nonlinearly during Development, suggesting involvement in rapidl…
26948607	Natural oxygenation of Champagne wine during ageing on lees: A metabolomics picture of hormesis.	aging	2016-07-15	The oxygenation of Champagne wine after 4 and 6 years of aging on lees in bottle was investigated by FTICR-MS and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Three levels of permeability were considered for the stoppers, ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 mg/L/year of oxygen transfer rate. Our results confirmed a good repeatability of ultra-high resolution FTICR-MS, both in terms of m/z and coefficient of variation of peak intensities among biological replicates. Vintages appeared to be the most discriminated features, and metabolite annotations suggested that the oldest wines (2006) were characterized by a higher sensitivity towards oxygenation. Within each vintage, the oxygenation mechanisms appeared to be different for low and high ingresses of oxygen, in agreement with the hormesis character of wine oxygenation. In the particular case of single variety wines and for a given level of stopper permeability, our results also showed that variety discrimination could be easily achieved among wines.
24939997	Skeletal muscle lipid content and oxidative activity in relation to muscle fiber type in aging and metabolic syndrome.	aging	2015-05-??	One of the most noticeable effects of aging is the reduction in skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). The metabolic syndrome (MS) is also prevalent in old subjects, but its relevance to skeletal muscle characteristics has poorly been investigated. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with muscle biopsies from young (22 years) and old (73 years) men with and without MS to reveal age-dependent and MS-associated modifications of fiber-type characteristics. Atrophy of type II fibers and altered fiber shape characterized muscle aging in lean healthy men. In contrast, increased cross-sectional area of the most abundant type I and type IIA fibers, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase content in all fiber types, characterized MS. Aging and particularly MS were associated with accumulation of intramyocellular lipid droplets. Although lipids mostly accumulated in type I fibers, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging of intramyocellular lipids did not di…
27922817	Ischemic stroke patients are biologically older than their chronological age.	aging	2016-??-25	Ischemic stroke is associated with aging. It is possible to predict chronological age by measuring age-related changes in DNA methylation from multiple CpG sites across the genome, known as biological age. The difference between biological age and actual chronological age would indicate an individual's level of aging. Our aim was to determine the biological age of ischemic stroke patients and compare their aging with controls of the same chronological age. A total of 123 individuals, 41 controls and 82 patients with ischemic stroke were paired by chronological age, ranging from 39 to 82 years. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites in both groups, and biological age was estimated using methylation values of specific CpGs. Ischemic stroke patients were  an average 2.5 years older than healthy controls (p-value=0.010). Stratified by age tertiles, younger stroke patients (≤57 years old) were biologically older than controls (OR=1.19; 9…
12493560	Serum cholesterol, precursors and metabolites and cognitive performance in an aging population.	aging	????-??-??	The present study investigated if a causal relation exists between serum concentrations of precursors and metabolites of cholesterol and cognitive performance in a healthy aging population. Cognitive function addressing four domains of 144 individuals (30-80 years) was tested at baseline and after 6 years of follow-up. Serum concentrations of different sterols related to cholesterol were measured. Serum levels of lathosterol and lanosterol correlated negatively with cognitive performance on the Word Learning tests for verbal learning and memory. This was observed at baseline and follow-up and was independent of age, sex and educational level. Furthermore, the levels of lathosterol and lanosterol at baseline correlated with performance on the Stroop test and Word Learning tests over the 6-year follow-up period. Serum levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol showed inconsistent correlations, while cholesterol, desmosterol, sitosterol and campesterol were not related to …
9915372	Muscle strength in the elderly: its relation to vitamin D metabolites.	aging	1999-01-??	OBJECTIVE: To identify a relation between loss of muscle strength and vitamin D deficiency in ambulatory elderly persons not receiving vitamin D supplementation.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.    SETTING: All measurements were taken at the Department of Geriatrics, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.    SUBJECTS: Three hundred nineteen patients (103 women, 216 men) selected by random sampling from participants in an ongoing interdisciplinary study on aging (mean age for women, 74.2 yrs; for men, 76.7 yrs).    OUTCOME MEASURES: Leg extension power (LEP) and body mass index (BMI); serum values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [calcidiol, 25(OH)D], 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D [calcitriol, 1,25(OH)2D], and intact parathyroid hormone (iPHT).    RESULTS: Twelve percent of women and 18% of men had 25(OH)D values below the normal range (<12 ng/mL). Muscle strength was lower in older subjects (female: r = -.35; p = .0005/male: r = -.48; p < .0001) and was lower in women than in men (p < .0001). In men …
28526856	2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) reduces age-related lipofuscin accumulation through a cholesterol-associated pathway.	aging	2017-??-19	Oxidative stress causes significant increases in both cholesterol uptake and intracellular accumulation of the aging biomarker lipofuscin. Here we show that HPβCD addition mitigates these adverse effects in human fibroblasts by significantly reducing LDLr and SREBP1 gene expression. In the absence of oxidative stress, HPβCD addition induces a paradoxical response, increasing cholesterol accumulation (but not lipofuscin) via upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. These two distinct, but opposite effects highlight a previously overlooked therapeutic consideration: the cholesterol content of the treated cell determines which cholesterol pathways, either beneficial or harmful, are responsive to HPβCD.
27569688	Serum Insulin-like growth factor-1 levels of healthy adults in southern China.	aging	2016-12-30	It is to establish the normal range and investigate the distribution characteristics of serum Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) for healthy adults in southern China. IGF-1 levels of 515 healthy adults (254 males and 261 females) were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassay. The subjects were strictly selected healthy volunteers, aged 20 to 84 years old, with equal five year intervals and without abnormal conditions that impacted IGF-1 levels. The reference ranges were calculated using the smooth centile curves of the LMS method (L: coefficient of skewness, M: median, S: coefficient of variation). IGF-1 declined with aging in adults. There were statistically significant differences for the IGF-1 levels between men and women in some subgroups of age. Gender differences varied depending on the age. Middle-aged females had higher IGF-1 whilst elder females had lower IGF-1. The statistical differences were seen in three subgroups of age between this study and a German cohort …
30593387	Network cultivation, diurnal cortisol and biological ageing: The rejuvenation hypothesis.	longevity	2019-01-??	A stronger motivation to cultivate social ties in older adults (ages range from 62 to 86 years) has been associated with a cortisol profile similar to that observed in undergraduate students, who are decades younger. We have shown the cultivation of social networks buffers against increases in diurnal cortisol common in old age. Cortisol is crucial for the response to stress and the process of ageing, and a recent study has demonstrated that a lower cortisol level is associated with longevity. We link the findings of social network cultivation and cortisol profile to the processes of biological ageing through DNA telomere length. Telomeres are repeated DNA sequences that cap and protect the ends of chromosomes, and telomere length is considered a potential biomarker for biological age because it is closely related to the cellular process of ageing and chronic stress and is inversely related to chronological age. Studies examining biological ageing have shown an association between an a…
18314561	Blood glucose and hormonal responses to small and large meals in healthy young and older women.	aging	1998-07-??	Blood glucose regulation in the fasting and fed states has important implications for health. In addition, the ability to maintain normal blood glucose homeostasis may be an important determinant of an individual's capacity to regulate food intake. We tested the hypothesis that aging is associated with an impairment in the ability to maintain normal blood glucose homeostasis following the consumption of large meals but not small ones, a factor that could help to explain age-related impairments in the control of food intake and energy regulation. The subjects were eight healthy younger women (25 +/- 2 years, SD) and eight healthy older women (72 +/- 2 years) with normal body weight and glucose tolerance. Following a 36-h period when diet and physical activity were controlled, subjects consumed test meals containing 0, 1046, 2092, and 4184 kJ (simulating extended fasting, and consumption of a snack, a small meal, and a moderately large meal), with 35% of energy from fat, 48% from carbohy…
24269882	Musculoskeletal system in the old age and the demand for healthy ageing biomarkers.	longevity	????-??-??	Population ageing has emerged as a major demographic trend worldwide due to improved health and longevity. This global ageing phenomenon will have a major impact on health-care systems worldwide due to increased morbidity and greater needs for hospitalization/institutionalization. As the ageing population increases worldwide, there is an increasing awareness not only of increased longevity but also of the importance of "healthy ageing" and "quality of life". Yet, the age related chronic inflammation is believed to be pathogenic with regards to its contribution to frailty and degenerative disorders. In particular, the frailty syndrome is increasingly being considered as a key risk indicator of adverse health outcomes. In addition, elderly may be also prone to be resistant to anabolic stimuli which is likely a key factor in the loss of skeletal muscle mass with ageing. Vital to understand these key biological processes is the development of biological markers, through system biology appr…
23064818	Health consequences of familial longevity influence among the Chinese elderly.	longevity, aging	2013-04-??	BACKGROUND: A comparative analysis between centenarians' children and neighborhood controls is an efficient approach to learn how familial longevity influence and its interaction with environmental factors affect healthy aging. Yet, there are few extant studies that inform this topic; this study expands this literature.    METHODS: We analyze data from 417 children of centenarians and 560 neighborhood controls without family history of longevity in China (all participants aged 60-80) using ordered logit regression models.    RESULTS: We found that, compared to the neighborhood controls and adjusted for various potentially confounding factors, centenarians' children had significantly better instrumental activities of daily living function(p < .001), smaller number of chronic conditions or health problems(p < .01), less anxiety and loneliness(p < .01), better cognitive function (p < .01), more resilience (p < .01), better self-rated health (p < .001), and better self-rated life satisfact…
10080274	In vivo spectroscopic quantification of the N-acetyl moiety, creatine, and choline from large volumes of brain gray and white matter: effects of normal aging.	aging	1999-02-??	Volumetric proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was used to generate brain metabolite maps in 15 young and 19 elderly adult volunteers. All subjects also had structural MR scans, and a model, which took into account the underlying structural composition of the brain contributing to each metabolite voxel, was developed and used to estimate the concentration of the N-acetyl-moiety (NAc), creatine (Cr), and choline (Cho) in gray matter and white matter. NAc concentration (signal intensity per unit volume of brain) was higher in gray than white matter and did not differ between young and old subjects despite significant gray matter volume deficits in the older subjects. To the extent that NAc is an index of neuronal integrity, the available gray matter appears to be intact in these older healthy adults. Cr concentrations were much higher in gray than white matter and significantly higher in the old than young subjects. Cho concentration in gray matter was also significant…
11158897	Regional differences and metabolic changes in normal aging of the human brain: proton MR spectroscopic imaging study.	aging	2001-01-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aging is recognized to originate from a diversity of mechanisms that blur the limits between normal and pathologic processes. The purpose of this study was to determine the early effect of normal aging on the regional distribution of brain metabolite concentrations, including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a major neuronal marker, choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr).    METHODS: Thirty-two healthy participants, ages 21 to 61 years, were examined by proton MR spectroscopic (1H MRS) imaging. 1H MRS imaging acquisitions were performed in two brain locations: the centrum semiovale and the temporal lobe. Thirty voxels were selected in four cerebral regions, cortical, semioval, temporal, and hippocampal, and 1H MR spectra were processed to determine the metabolite ratios.    RESULTS: With advancing age of the participants, the ratios of %NAA, NAA:Cho, and NAA:Cr were significantly decreased, whereas the ratios of %Cho and %Cr were significantly increased in the cortical, semio…
3824379	Age- and sex-related profiles of serum primary and total bile acids in infants, children and adults.	aging	1986-11-??	The relation of age and sex to serum primary (PBA) and total bile acid (TBA) concentrations was evaluated by an enzymatic fluorometric microassay in healthy infants, children and adults. TBA concentrations were the highest in the 6-day-old group and 1-month-old group and seemed to switch to almost normal adult levels by the age of 4-6 years, which persisted throughout life, while PBA concentrations were predominant over a period of 3 days to 3 months after birth. No sex-related differences were observed from neonates to very old persons for any of serum bile acids. These results show that the bile acid metabolism in the liver and the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids are usually matured in infancy and that aging and sex may insignificantly affect serum bile acid metabolic profiles.
24224517	In vivo evidence of an age-related increase in ATP cost of contraction in the plantar flexor muscles.	aging	2014-04-??	Impaired skeletal muscle efficiency potentially contributes to the age-related decline in exercise capacity and may explain the altered haemodynamic response to exercise in the elderly. Thus we examined whether (i) the ATP cost of contraction increases with age, and (ii) this results in altered convective O(2) delivery to maintain microvascular oxygenation in the calf muscle. To this aim, we used an integrative experimental approach combining (31)P-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy), Doppler ultrasound imaging and NIRS (near-IR spectroscopy) during dynamic plantar flexion exercise at 40% of WR(max) (maximal power output) in 20 healthy young and 20 older subjects matched for physical activity. The ATP cost of contraction was significantly higher in the old (7.2±4.1 mM/min per W) compared with the young (2.4±1.9 mM/min per W; P<0.05) and this was only significantly correlated with the plantar flexion WR(max) value in the old subjects (r=-0.52; P<0.05). Even when differences in power o…
1376613	Testicular and adrenocortical function in healthy men and in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.	aging	1992-05-??	The influence of aging upon serum concentrations of testicular steroids, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and pituitary hormones and on adrenal steroid levels and adrenal steroid response to ACTH was studied in 81 healthy men aged 20-87 years. These endocrine variables were also compared in 43 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), aged 58-89 years and in a subgroup of 41 men, aged 58-87 years, from the above mentioned reference population. The normal endocrine aging was characterized by a rise in SHBG levels, decreasing levels of testicular steroids and non-SHBG-bound testosterone (NST) and increasing gonadotropin levels and decreasing concentrations of total estrone. Adrenal androgen levels decreased in the presence of unchanged levels of cortisol and the adrenal steroid response to ACTH changed by decreasing increments in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) and increasing increments in 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP). With the exception of the alterations in SHBG and adr…
26568214	_"I want to be 100 years old, but I smoke too much": Exploring the gap between positive aging goals and reported preparatory actions in different social circumstances.	aging	2015-12-??	Preparing for positive aging is shaped by the social context a person lives in. The present qualitative study explores and compares representations about preparatory actions in precarious workers (i.e., with temporary job contracts and insecure pension plans) and individuals with secure pension plans living in Germany. It also examines, the discrepancy between what middle-aged persons think they should be doing in preparation and what they report doing for aging well. Findings from the analysis of the semi-structured interviews conducted here show that people who have insecure pension plans tend to see themselves as social networkers and optimists, while those with secure pension plans see themselves as social activists and careful planners of old age. All participants value an active, healthy body but manage to do little in order to attain it due to lacking time and discipline. In accordance with the socioemotional selectivity theory, perceiving a short-time perspective makes precario…
12601215	Brain changes with aging: MR spectroscopy at supraventricular plane shows differences between women and men.	aging	2003-03-??	PURPOSE: To assess the effect of aging on the proportions of choline (Cho), creatine, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brains of elderly women and men.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: A transverse plane above the ventricle of the brain was mapped with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Examinations were performed in 1995-1996 with 271 healthy subjects (age range, 60-90 years; mean age, 73 years) and were repeated 4 years later (1999-2000). Student t tests were used for statistical analysis.    RESULTS: Difference analysis of the changes in 4 years (paired data) reproduced the decrease in Cho in women only (2.9% per year, P <.001) that had been indicated with intersubject correlation analyses. Decreases in NAA, though significant in both men and women according to age correlation analyses (P <.01 for both), did not reach significance. The resulting sex difference in the Cho/NAA ratio at a mean age of 77 years, while not yet significant at a mean age of 73 years, was especially manifest in the…
25041144	Metabolites related to gut bacterial metabolism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activation, and insulin sensitivity are associated with physical function in functionally-limited older adults.	aging	2014-10-??	Identification of mechanisms underlying physical function will be important for addressing the growing challenge that health care will face with physical disablement in the expanding aging population. Therefore, the goals of the current study were to use metabolic profiling to provide insight into biologic mechanisms that may underlie physical function by examining the association between baseline and the 6-month change in serum mass spectrometry-obtained amino acids, fatty acids, and acylcarnitines with baseline and the 6-month change in muscle strength (leg press one repetition maximum divided by total lean mass, LP/Lean), lower extremity function [short physical performance battery (SPPB)], and mobility (400 m gait speed, 400-m), in response to 6 months of a combined resistance exercise and nutritional supplementation (whey protein or placebo) intervention in functionally-limited older adults (SPPB ≤ 10; 70-85 years, N = 73). Metabolites related to gut bacterial metabolism (cinnamoy…
26162663	Does aging affect source monitoring and cognitive confidence in schizophrenia? Preliminary results.	aging	2015-08-30	This study tested the influence of aging on source-monitoring and cognitive confidence deficits in schizophrenia. Younger (n=13) and older (n=10) schizophrenia patients were compared with younger (n=17) and older (n=10) healthy controls in the source-monitoring task. These preliminary results suggest that age negatively influences old/new item recognition, but not source monitoring, in both groups. Age has a negative impact on subjective confidence, but no interaction between group and age was found.
24374734	Comparison of explosive force between young and elderly women: evidence of an earlier decline from explosive force.	aging	2014-04-??	The aging process causes many changes in muscle strength, and analysis of explosive force from handgrip strength seems to be useful and promising in studying the aging musculoskeletal system. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate if explosive force parameters [rate of force development (RFD) and contractile impulse (CI) over the time interval of 0-200 ms from the onset of contraction] during handgrip efforts decline differently than maximum handgrip strength with increasing age. Twenty healthy young women (20-27 years) and 65 healthy elderly women, assigned into three age groups (50-64, 65-74, and 75-86 years), participated in this study. All participants performed two maximal grip attempts. Handgrip data were recorded as force-time curves, peak force, and explosive force parameters. Our results revealed that peak force decreased significantly (p < 0.05) for those who are 65 years old, while explosive force parameters decreased significantly (p < 0.05) for those aged …
16147900	Circadian phase in adults of contrasting ages.	aging	2005-??-??	There is evidence that aging may impair phase-shifting responses to light synchronizers, which could lead to disturbed or malsynchronized circadian rhythms. To explore this hypothesis, 62 elder participants (age, 58 to 84 years) and 25 young adults (age, 19 to 40 years) were studied, first with baseline 1-wk wrist actigraphy at home and then by 72 h in-laboratory study using an ultra-short sleep-wake cycle. Subjects were awake for 60 minutes in 50 lux followed by 30 minutes of darkness for sleep. Saliva samples were collected for melatonin, and urine samples were collected for aMT6s (a urinary metabolite of melatonin) and free cortisol every 90 minutes. Oral temperatures were also measured every 90 minutes. The timing of the circadian rhythms was not significantly more variable among the elders. The times of lights-out and wake-up at home and urinary free cortisol occurred earlier among elders, but the acrophases (cosinor analysis-derived peak time) of the circadian rhythm of salivary …
11155349	The turnover of body water as an indicator of health.	aging	2000-09-??	Water homeostasis is essential for healthy living. Body water turnover, meaning the replacement of body water that is lost in a given period of time, has been examined in a number of previous studies, and a review of their results has yielded the following findings. Children up to 15 years of age show higher body water turnover than adults, although it is not clear how the aging process influences body water. Among people of similar age, the rate of body water turnover seems to be higher in those who exercise than in those who are sedentary. Therefore we hypothesized that healthy individuals have a higher body water turnover than unhealthy individuals whose metabolic balance, as indicated by water turnover, has broken down, and that a prolonged condition of excessively slow body water turnover may be associated with a lower level of metabolism. If so, body water turnover can be an indicator of human health. However, there is a paucity of information regarding water turnover rates in in…
7962278	Changes in serum concentrations of conjugated and unconjugated steroids in 40- to 80-year-old men.	aging	1994-10-??	It is well recognized that aging in men is accompanied by a decline in the serum levels of some adrenal and testicular steroids, but little or no attention has focused on the multiple steroid metabolites that are formed by steroid-converting enzymes in target tissues. In the present study, we have examined in detail the serum concentrations of a large series of adrenal and testicular steroids and their most significant metabolites produced in intracrine peripheral tissues. The serum concentrations of 26 conjugated and unconjugated C21-, C19-, and C18-steroids were measured in 2423 men aged 40-80 yr. The serum concentrations of the major circulating adrenal C19-steroids, namely dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S), androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol and its sulfate, and androstenedione, decreased by about 60% between the ages of 40-80 yr. The small decrease in the serum concentrations of progesterone and pregnenolone in the presence of increased levels of cortisol and …
11248514	Bioanalysis of age-related changes of lipid metabolism in nonagenarians.	longevity	2001-03-??	The aim of the present study was the bioanalysis of lipid metabolism in the aged patients and to study the relationship between these biochemical markers and longevity. Eleven nonagenarians, nine women and two men, aged 94+/-3 years and ten control patients, six women and four men, aged 84+/-5 years, followed at the Department of Metabolic Care and Gerontology, Charles University, Teaching Hospital entered the study. All subjects were self-sufficient, without major illnesses and free living. At the start of the project the free fatty acids (FFA), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), retinol, alpha tocopherol, ascorbic acid, cholesterol, triacylglycerols, phospholipids in serum, in lipoprotein fractions and fatty acids (FA) and phospholipids in erythrocyte membrane were determined. We used capillary gas chromatography for determination of fatty acids.

On the other hand, under dark nonoxidative conditions, they can be very stable. Thus, the precise chemical and biological environment is of crucial importance in determining whether, and how, they are transformed. Three important biologically active derivatives of carotenoids, vitamin A, trisporic acid and abscisic acid, all of which serve as hormones in appropriate cells, are, or can be, formed from precursor carotenoids. Highly active forms of all three hormones are 9-cis isomers. In all cases, the products are involved both in light-induced reactions as well as in cellular differentiation, often related to sexual maturation. Each of these hormones is formed by an initial dioxygenase attack on the central conjugated chain of carotenoids followed by a series of specific reactions. Indeed, when various carotenoids of different structure are studied in humans, each shows a characteristic, if not unique, …
17632090	The relationship between white matter brain metabolites and cognition in normal aging: the GENIE study.	aging	2007-08-20	Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated age-related changes in brain metabolites that may underlie micro-structural brain changes, but few studies have examined their relationship with cognitive decline. We performed a cross-sectional study of brain metabolism and cognitive function in 82 healthy adults (aged 50-90) participating in the GENIE (St GEorge's Neuropsychology and Imaging in the Elderly) study. Absolute metabolite concentrations were measured by proton chemical shift imaging within voxels placed in the centrum semiovale white matter. Cognitive abilities assessed were executive function, working memory, information processing speed, long-term memory and fluid intelligence. Correlations showed that all cognitive domains declined with age. Total creatine (tCr) concentration increased with age (r=0.495, p<0.001). Regression analyses were performed for each cognitive variable, including estimated intelligence and the metabolites, with age then added as a final step…
23639206	Frailty and mortality are not influenced by mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in the very old.	longevity, aging	2013-12-??	Inherited genetic variation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could account for the missing heritability of human longevity and healthy aging. Here, we show no robust association between common genetic variants of mtDNA and frailty (an "unhealthy aging" phenotype) or mortality in 700, more than 85-year-old, participants of the Newcastle 85+ study. Conflicting data from different populations underscore our conclusion that there is currently no compelling link between inherited mtDNA variants and aging.
20716923	Markers of oxidative stress in erythrocytes and plasma during aging in humans.	aging	????-??-??	Aging is an inevitable universal biological process, which can be characterized by a general decline in physiological function with the accumulation of diverse adverse changes and increased probability of death. Among several theories, oxidative stress/free radical theory offers the best mechanistic elucidation of the aging process and other age -related phenomenon. In the present paper , we discuss the aging process and have focused on the importance of some reliable markers of oxidative stress which may be used as biomarkers of the aging process.
21936839	Mitochondrial quality control in aging and lifespan control of the fungal aging model Podospora anserina.	aging	2011-10-??	Aging of biological systems is a fundamental process controlled by a complex network of molecular pathways. In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, a model in which organismal aging can conveniently be analysed, mitochondria play a central role. A wide range of relevant pathways were identified that contribute to the maintenance of a population of functional mitochondria. These pathways act in a hierarchical manner, but all the pathways are limited in capacity. At the end of the life cycle, when the various surveillance pathways are overwhelmed and damage has passed certain thresholds, programmed cell death brings the life of individual P. anserina to an end.
22427544	Does increased blood pressure rather than aging influence retinal pulse wave velocity?	aging	2012-04-24	PURPOSE: It was demonstrated previously that retinal pulse wave velocity (rPWV) as a measure of retinal arterial stiffness is increased in aged anamnestically healthy volunteers compared with young healthy subjects. Using novel methodology of rPWV assessment this finding was confirmed and investigated whether it might relate to the increased blood pressure usually accompanying the aging process, rather than to the aging itself.    METHODS: A total of 12 young 25.5-year-old (24.0-28.8) [median(1st quartile-3rd quartile)] and 12 senior 68.5-year-old (63.8-71.8) anamnestically healthy volunteers; and 12 senior 63.0-year-old (60.8-65.0) validated healthy volunteers and 12 young 33.0-year-old (29.5-35.0) hypertensive patients were examined. Time-dependent alterations of vessel diameter were assessed by the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer in a retinal artery of each subject. The data were filtered and processed using mathematical signal analysis and rPWVs were calculated.    RESULTS: rPWV amounted t…
10788723	A (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of aging in parietal white matter: implications for trials in multiple sclerosis.	aging	2000-05-??	1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a unique tool to detect and quantify brain metabolites. In multiple sclerosis it can be used to investigate axonal loss or dysfunction through measurement of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a neuronal marker. Previous studies in adults have reported variable effects of aging on metabolite concentrations but have predominantly focused on changes in the elderly. This study has examined a younger adult age group to provide a reference database more applicable to the multiple sclerosis population. Single voxel (1)H MRS was carried out in 44 subjects between 22 and 62 years of age. Sixteen subjects underwent repeat examination after one year. Absolute concentrations of NA (the sum of NAA and N-acetyl aspartate glutamate), NAA, creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr), choline containing compounds (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI) were measured. NA, NAA and mI concentrations did not correlate with age but there were significant correlations between age and Cr (r = …
15447904	B-6 vitamers and 4-pyridoxic acid in the plasma, erythrocytes, and urine of postmenopausal women.	aging	2004-10-??	BACKGROUND: Although many studies have reported reduced vitamin B-6 status with aging, little information is available about the specific effects of menopause.    OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine vitamin B-6 metabolism in premenopausal and early postmenopausal women.    DESIGN: We examined dietary intake and vitamin B-6 metabolites in the plasma, erythrocytes, and urine of 30 premenopausal women (x +/- SD age: 41.9 +/- 4.8 y) and 30 women (aged 54.0 +/- 3.8 y) who were 4.0 +/- 1.4 y past menopause.    RESULTS: Vitamin B-6 intake in the postmenopausal group (1.97 +/- 0.40 mg/d) was significantly greater than that in the premenopausal group (1.63 +/- 0.50 mg/d). Plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxal concentrations and erythrocyte PLP, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine phosphate concentrations were in the normal range in both groups and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Plasma and erythrocyte 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) concentrations were significantly higher in the postmen…
26474472	Relationship between Brain Age-Related Reduction in Gray Matter and Educational Attainment.	aging	2015-??-??	Inter-subject variability in age-related brain changes may relate to educational attainment, as suggested by cognitive reserve theories. This voxel-based morphometry study investigated the impact of very low educational level on the relationship between regional gray matter (rGM) volumes and age in healthy elders. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired in elders with low educational attainment (less than 4 years) (n = 122) and high educational level (n = 66), pulling together individuals examined using either of three MRI scanners/acquisition protocols. Voxelwise group comparisons showed no rGM differences (p<0.05, family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons). When within-group voxelwise patterns of linear correlation were compared between high and low education groups, there was one cluster of greater rGM loss with aging in low versus high education elders in the left anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.05, FWE-corrected), as well as a trend in the left dorsomedial prefront…
15303090	Crystallins in water soluble-high molecular weight protein fractions and water insoluble protein fractions in aging and cataractous human lenses.	aging	2004-07-19	PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to comparatively analyze crystallin fragments in the water soluble high molecular weight (WS-HMW) and in the water insoluble (WI) protein fractions of human cataractous (with nuclear opacity) and age matched normal lenses to determine the identity of crystallin species that show cataract specific changes such as truncation and post-translational modifications. Because these changes were cataract specific and not aging specific, the results were expected to provide information regarding potential mechanisms of age related cataract development.    METHODS: The WS-alpha-crystallin, WS-HMW protein, and WI protein fractions were isolated from normal lenses of different ages and from cataractous lenses. The three fractions were subjected to two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (IEF in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension). Individual spots from 2D gels were trypsin digested and the tryptic fragments were analyzed by matrix-assisted la…
8120420	Ultrasound structure and digital image analysis of the subepidermal low echogenic band in aged human skin: diurnal changes and interindividual variability.	aging	1994-03-??	Subepidermal low-echogenic band is a consistent echostructural finding in aged and photodamaged skin. The thickness of subepidermal low-echogenic band is considered to closely reflect the degree of cutaneous aging and its use for the monitoring of the severity of photoaging and the efficacy of drugs is rapidly expanding. We investigated subepidermal low-echogenic band structure in 23 old healthy volunteers (ages 75-100) with a high-frequency ultrasound scanner (B-mode, 20 MHz). Images were collected from the volar fore-arm twice daily: in the morning before getting up and 12 h later. To assess the severity of subepidermal low-echogenic band, echogenicity of the subepidermal region was determined by the image analysis and compared with visual scoring and subepidermal low-echogenic band thickness. All three methods gave consistent results, image analysis being the most sensitive, reliable, and bias-free. Significant interindividual variability of subepidermal low-echogenic band echostruc…
21741093	Influence of age on the dynamics of fMRI activations during a semantic fluency task.	aging	2012-07-??	PURPOSE: Age-related fMRI changes have not been extensively studied for language, whereas important adaptive mechanisms have been seen in other cognitive fields. This study examined age-related changes in fMRI activation during language tasks and, in particular, their dynamic course.    PATIENTS AND METHODS: fMRI was performed on 22 young and 21 old healthy right-handed subjects during a silent category word-generation task. Activation and dynamics of BOLD signals were studied separately during the first and second portions of each 30-s block.    RESULTS: Activation of the left frontal lobe was initially similar in young and old participants; however, it decreased after 30 s in the old participants. On the other hand, additional areas were initially involved only in old subjects and especially in the default mode network.    CONCLUSION: This study showed age-related differences in the dynamics of fMRI activation during a silent word-generation task, suggesting a different pattern of la…
3612118	Distribution of dolichol and dolichyl phosphate in human brain.	aging	1987-09-??	Autopsy material from deceased individuals between ages 2 and 90 was used to prepare cerebellum, pons, and other selected regions of the brain, the spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The concentration of dolichol in these different tissues varied greatly and the increase in concentration during the life span varied between 2.5- and 21-fold. In contrast, dolichyl-phosphate (dolichyl-P) was more evenly distributed in these tissues and its concentration increased to a moderate extent only during childhood. The level of cholesterol displayed smaller regional differences and decreased about 15% between ages 35 and 90. Differences in the total phospholipid content were limited. These results demonstrate enrichment and individual regulation of various lipids in specialized regions of the human brain. The independent regulation of dolichol and dolichyl-P levels in the brain and the possible role of dolichol in the function of the aging nerve cell are also emphasized.
19162912	Cuffless and non-invasive Systolic Blood Pressure estimation for aged class by using a Photoplethysmograph.	aging	2008-??-??	This study provides cuffless and non-invasive technique of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) estimation by using only a Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. As people get older, cardiovascular peculiarities are changing more and more, so this study focuses on the presumption of SBP in old age. Ages 60 and over were defined as old age and grouped into an aged class in this study, ages fewer than 60 were grouped into a young-middle class. The measured data in this experiment were both Capacity Pulse Wave (PW) and SBP. PW was obtained by the PPG and SBP was obtained by the commercial Blood Pressure (BP) meter with a cuff. Then the regression equation of SBP was calculated from individual information and features of PW. 96 healthy volunteers participated in the BP and PW measurement experiment. This result implied that patients' cardiovascular peculiarities change according to aging and vary among difference individuals. Furthermore, the data of old age were classified into four classes through …
8429407	Energy expenditure, aging and body composition.	aging	1993-??-??	We investigated the importance of adaptive variations in energy expenditure in the regulation of energy balance in young and elderly men of normal body weight leading unrestricted lives. Changes were measured in total and resting energy expenditure and body composition in response to overeating by approximately 4.2 MJ/d or undereating by 3.3 MJ/d for 21 d in 39 young and elderly men consuming a typical diet. In the young men, an average of 85-90% of the excess energy intake during overeating was deposited. During underfeeding, mobilization of body energy compensated for an average of 65% of the energy deficit in these subjects. The resting metabolic rate, averaged for fasting and fed states, increased during overfeeding (+0.63 +/- 0.20 MJ/d, P < 0.01) and decreased during underfeeding (-0.42 +/- 0.12 MJ/d), but at least some of these changes were due to the obligatory expenditure associated with nutrient assimilation. There was no significant change in energy expenditure for physical a…
17660884	Ageism: does it exist among children?	longevity	2007-07-27	Ageism is stereotyping and prejudice against individuals or groups because of their age. Robert Butler first used it in 1969, to express a systematic stereotyping and discrimination against elderly people. Available data appears to confirm that attitudes of children to the old age differ from that of adults. The study population consisted of 162 subjects (56 school children, 48 nurses and 58 elderly patients). Each subject in the survey was asked to respond to the following three questions: Question #1: "Is the old age unattractive?"; Question #2: "How old is an old man?"; Question #3: "What should you do to have a long life (what is good for longevity)? The majority of polled children (33) gave positive statements about ageing in their responses to the first item, while most of the nurses gave condition answers, like: "It is not unattractive if you are healthy". Elderly subjects made up a group with the majority of negative responses (in percentage), as only 33% of them answered that …
8403737	The relationship between phenazone (antipyrine) metabolite formation and theophylline metabolism in healthy and frail elderly women.	aging	1993-08-??	The influence of aging on the metabolism of phenazone (antipyrine), and the relationship between the formation of 3 phenazone metabolites and the metabolic clearance of theophylline in healthy and frail elderly women, were examined. Whereas the elimination half-life did not change, clearance of phenazone decreased by about 50% with age in healthy women receiving phenazone without theophylline. However, the summation of the urinary recovery of phenazone and the measured metabolites, expressed as percentage of the phenazone dose, was lower in the healthy elderly (37 +/- 9% vs 74 +/- 15%). In both healthy and frail females the clearance of formation of 4-hydroxy-phenazone and the metabolic clearance of theophylline correlated strongly (r = 0.93 and 0.90, respectively). In non-healthy elderly females, strong correlations were also observed between the other metabolic pathways of phenazone and the metabolic clearance of theophylline. Coadministration of theophylline in the elderly increased…
10048317	The photochemical attachment of the O-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine to alpha-crystallin: a model for lenticular aging.	aging	1999-02-??	The young human lens contains a small metabolite from tryptophan called the O-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKG). Its function is to absorb most radiation between 295 and 400 nm, preventing it from reaching the retina. With age the concentration of this component decreases while the lens crystallins acquire covalently attached chromophores. This study investigates the photochemical attachment of 3-HKG to lens alpha-crystallin. Initial studies showed that alpha-crystallin photolyzed in the presence of 3-HKG developed a fluorescence (emission, 440 nm) and UV-visible spectrum similar to that found in aged human lens proteins. Extensive studies were then performed on the tryptic HPLC maps as monitored by photodiode array and fluorescent detection. Numerous photoproducts with either blue (emission, > 400 nm) or green (emission, > 500 nm) fluorescence were formed in addition to nonfluorescent compounds with absorption maxima above 300 nm. Comparisons were made between these model photo…
15718784	The physiology and pharmacology of growing old, as shown in body simulation.	aging	2005-??-??	Geriatric medicine is becoming increasingly important, due to the aging of our population. Healthcare givers need methods that can teach efficiently and painlessly the complexities involved with aging. One important tool in this area comprises modeling and simulation. Accordingly, we present a detailed model and simulation of the aging process. To implement the aging process, we changed over 50 existing parameters that are part of a physiologic, pharmacologic multiple transport model of the human body. To evaluate the new patients, we imposed three stresses: anesthesia induction, hemorrhage and apnea. Five patients were used: a young healthy patient and four healthy, but elderly, patients, aged 65, 75, 85 and 95 years. We observed an age-related response to the stresses. The elderly patients fared worse with anesthetic induction and with hemorrhage, but better with apnea. Some independent data support our results.
12840206	The age-related decline in resting energy expenditure in humans is due to the loss of fat-free mass and to alterations in its metabolically active components.	aging	2003-07-??	There is conflicting evidence as to whether the age-related decline in resting energy expenditure (REE) can be attributed to i) absolute changes in fat-free mass (FFM), ii) alterations in the composition of FFM or iii) decreasing organ metabolic rates. This study directly addressed the first and second hypotheses by quantification of metabolically active components of FFM assuming constant tissue respiration rates to calculate REE (REEc). REE was measured (REEm) in 26 young (13 females, 13 males, age 22-31 y) and 26 elderly subjects (15 females, 11 males, age 60-82 y) by indirect calorimetry and detailed body composition analysis was obtained using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and MRI. Specific organ metabolic rates were taken from the literature. REEm adjusted for differences in FFM was lower in older subjects than in younger control subjects (5.43 +/- 0.61 MJ/d compared with 6.37 +/- 0.48 MJ/d; P < 0.001). Skeletal muscle mass plus l…
19190667	Longitudinal changes in energy expenditure in an elderly German population: a 12-year follow-up.	aging	2009-08-??	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study investigates age-dependent changes in different components of energy expenditure (EE) within the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population in Giessen, Germany (GISELA).    SUBJECTS/METHODS: Between 1994 and 2006, data obtained at a total of 3033 visits from 363 women and 153 men with a mean initial age of 67.4+/-5.9 and 66.9+/-5.2 years, respectively, were evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up was 8 years. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was assessed by indirect calorimetry and physical activity patterns were assessed by questionnaire. EE of physical activity and total EE (TEE) were calculated using multipliers for RMR. Energy intake was determined through a validated 3-day estimated dietary record. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the influence of age on EE adjusted for covariates.    RESULTS: Resting metabolic rate decreased in women and men by 158 and 326 kJ/d per decade, respectively; after considering change…
10398946	1H chemical shift imaging of the human brain at age 60-90 years reveals metabolic differences between women and men.	aging	1999-07-??	1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to compare brain metabolism in 540 elderly persons, stratified by sex and age (60-90 years old). An 8 x 8 x 2 cm3 supraventricular brain volume, a transverse plane parallel to the canthomeatal line, was examined by automated 1H chemical shift imaging [point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS), TE of 35 msec]. Regional choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak areas in the 518 successful examinations (96%) were studied by division through the total area of the particular metabolite in each spectral map. This procedure eliminated intersubject variance, maximized intervoxel variance (26 < or = F < or = 149, P < 0.0001) and reduced the standard deviations in the voxel metabolite signals threefold. Normalized signals in women (n = 257) and men (n = 261) differed in 9 (Cho/sigma Cho), 8 (Cr/sigma Cr), and 10 (NAA/sigma NAA) of 36 voxels examined (P < or = 0.001). In the cingulate gyrus Cho/sigma Cho, Cr/sigma Cr, and NAA/sigma NAA w…
22124478	Subjective perception of health in elderly inpatients.	aging	2012-??-??	There is evidence that subjective health is an important variable in general health outcomes. It can be an indicator of the individual's overall health status, creating a reliable and valid estimate about health. Quality of life (QoL) assessment can be associated with the individuals' subjective assessment of their own health status. The aim of the present study was to investigate variables associated with subjective perception of health in older inpatients. Ninety elderly inpatients over 60 years old were interviewed. The perception of health assessment (healthy/unhealthy) allocated elders in either of two groups. All the elders answered sociodemographic questions, the WHOQOL-100 and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Comparing the group that considered themselves unhealthy to the other group, the former showed a tendency of worse QoL assessments in five out of six domains investigated. Significant differences were found for the physical and level of independence domains, as well as…
16567380	Longitudinal changes during aging using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	aging	2006-03-??	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the longitudinal change in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) visible metabolites (N-acetyl aspartate [NAA], creatine [Cr], choline [Cho], and myo-Inositol [mI]) in brains of elderly individuals over 3 years and relate them to cognitive function.    METHODS: Neurologically and psychiatrically normal volunteers (n = 40) were examined at baseline and 3 years later with (1)H-MRS in two voxels (frontal white matter n = 29, and occipitoparietal gray matter n = 36) and with detailed neuropsychological assessments. Longitudinal analyses were performed with age, educational level, sex, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in voxels as covariates.    RESULTS: Frontal mI was significantly increased over time in male participants, but all other metabolites were stable over time. Neuropsychological performance was not significantly changed over 3 years, and there was no relationship between change in metabolite levels and change in neuropsychologica…
8519487	Hormonal changes in male subjects over-ninety.	aging	????-??-??	The physiology of aging in very old people is still poorly understood. A wide variety of age-related factors confuse the interpretation of existing data, especially as regards the modifications of the endocrine system. The effect of age on the gonad-hypophyseal function was studied in 26 over ninety-year-old males and compared with a control aged between 27 and 88, subdivided into age groups. The serum levels of total testosterone were stable up to the ninth decade while they were lower in the over ninety-year-olds; free testosterone and its peripheral metabolites (estrogens and dehydrotestosterone) were also lower in the over ninety-year-olds with respect to the others, although the decrease had started more gradually at about the fourth decade. Sex-hormone-binding-globulin, the main serum carrier of testosterone, increased gradually with age. The levels of hypophyseal gonadotropins were constant up to the ninth decade where a significant and abrupt increase was observed. The data sug…
21975347	Acetaminophen metabolism after major surgery: a greater challenge with increasing age.	aging	2011-11-??	Patients undergoing major surgery represent a good model for the study of the hepatic metabolism of acetaminophen (APAP) after surgery and for the evaluation of how the detoxification process is influenced by aging. Thirty patients received intravenous APAP (1 g/6 h) for 4 days (D1-D4). Daily 24-h urinary metabolites-cysteine-APAP, mercapturate-APAP, APAP, and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates-as well as blood glutathione levels were compared with repeated-measures analysis of variance (significance, P<0.05). Between D1 and D4, cysteine-APAP increased (308±308 mg vs. 570±512 mg, P=0.005), and sulfate and glucuronide conjugates decreased (1,365±1,084 mg vs. 694±600 mg, P<0.0001 and 2,418±817 mg vs. 1,513±1,076 mg, P=0.011, respectively). Blood glutathione decreased (790±125 vs. 623±132 µmol/l, P<0.0001. These changes increased with aging. APAP disposition after major surgery shifts toward the oxidative pathways of metabolism, and this is enhanced with aging. Supplementation with sulfur…
3047204	Protein modification in aging.	aging	1988-09-??	The age-related accumulation of abnormal forms of enzymes is attributable to posttranslational modification of protein structure and to a progressive loss with age of proteases that preferentially degrade the modified forms. The protein modifications include, but are not limited to: the oxidation of amino acid side chains (especially, side chains of prolyl, arginyl, lysyl and histidinyl residues) by mixed-function oxidation systems; the deamidation of asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues; the racemization and isomerization of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues; the isomerization of prolyl residues; the oxidation of cysteine sulfhydryl groups; and spontaneous changes in protein conformation that are apparently unlinked to changes in amino acid composition. Evidence supporting the roles of these protein modifications and of the proteases that degrade abnormal enzymes during aging is discussed, as well as a consideration of some technical limitations of the methods used in their study.
30702032	An Analysis of Famous Person Semantic Memory in Aging.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: In contrast to most memory systems that decline with age, semantic memory tends to remain relatively stable across the life span. However, what exactly is stable remains unclear. Is it the quantity of information available or the organization of semantic memory, i.e., the connections between semantic items? Even less is known about semantic memory for celebrities, a subsystem of semantic memory. In the present study, we studied the organization of person-specific semantic memory and its stability in aging.    METHODS: We designed a word association task based on a previous study, which consisted in providing the first word that came to the mind of the participants (15 participants for each age group 20-30, 40-50 and 60-70 years old) for 144 celebrities. We developed a new taxonomy of associated responses as the responses associated with celebrities name could in principle be very varied.    RESULTS: We found that most responses (>90%) could be grouped into five categories (…
17194465	Effects of age and mild cognitive impairment on direct and indirect access to arithmetic knowledge.	aging	2007-04-08	The present study aimed at investigating age-related changes and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) related effects in simple arithmetic. To pursue this goal, MCI patients, healthy old adults and young adults performed three computerised tasks. The production (e.g., 3 x 4=?) and the verification task (3 x 4 12?) evaluated direct access to multiplication knowledge, the number-matching task (3 x 4 34?, 'do 3 x 4 and 34 have the same digits?') tested indirect access. In verification and number-matching, interference from related distractors (e.g., 3 x 4 followed by 16) relative to unrelated distractors (17) reflects access to stored fact representations as well as efficiency of inhibition processes. Results indicated that, compared to young adults, MCI and healthy old adults were slower in responding across tasks. In production and verification, analyses of individual latency regression slopes and intercepts suggested that these age effects were related to differences at peripheral processin…
3431372	Body composition and aerobic capacity in young and middle-aged endurance-trained men.	aging	1987-12-??	Aging is associated with increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, lower maximal O2 uptake, and lower energy intake. It has been asserted that these changes are caused in part by decreased activity. In order to determine the effects of aging in men who are habitually active, 6 young men (26.8 +/- 1.2 yr) and 6 middle-aged men (52.0 +/- 1.9 yr) who had been running, cycling, and/or rowing for at least 2 yr were studied in a metabolic ward. The men consumed a diet to maintain constant body weight while keeping to their usual exercise schedule and intensity. Both groups had a similar body mass index and muscle mass, but the middle-aged men had a 77% greater fat mass (P = 0.028). Daily energy requirement was 17% lower in the middle-aged men (P = 0.029) although basal metabolic rate was similar in both groups. Aerobic capacity was 15% lower in the middle-aged men per unit body weight (P = 0.048) but not per unit of lean body mass. The young men exercised for an average 12.3 hr.wk-1 and the…
23876249	Lower theta inter-trial phase coherence during performance monitoring is related to higher reaction time variability: a lifespan study.	lifespan	2013-12-??	Trial-to-trial reaction time (RT) variability is consistently higher in children and older adults than in younger adults. Converging evidence also indicates that higher RT variability is (a) associated with lower behavioral performance on complex cognitive tasks, (b) distinguishes patients with neurological deficits from healthy individuals, and also (c) predicts longitudinal cognitive decline in older adults. However, so far the processes underlying increased RT variability are poorly understood. Previous evidence suggests that control signals in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) are reflected in theta band activity and may implicate the coordination of distinct brain areas during performance monitoring. We hypothesized that greater trial-to-trial variability in theta power during performance monitoring may be associated with greater behavioral variability in response latencies. We analyzed event-related theta oscillations assessed during a cued-Go/NoGo task in a lifespan sample coverin…
11281310	Apathy, anhedonia, and psychomotor retardation in elderly psychiatric patients and healthy elderly individuals.	aging	2001-??-??	Normal aging of the brain affects the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. These circuits are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Normal aging may therefore influence the symptomatology of psychiatric disorders in the elderly. We investigated motivational behavior that is associated with the function of these circuits, such as apathy, anhedonia, and psychomotor retardation in healthy elderly subjects and psychiatric inpatients (age > or = 60 yr). Apathy, anhedonia, and psychomotor retardation were assessed with the Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and the Widlöcher Retardation Rating Scale. Other measurements included the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the assessment of vascular risk factors. We found some evidence for age-related changes in motivational behavior. In the healthy elderly group (n = 64), increasing age was associated with anhedonia, and in the patient group (n = 62), incre…
10067983	Increase in the advanced glycation end product pentosidine in Bruch's membrane with age.	aging	1999-03-??	PURPOSE: To determine whether there is an age-related increase of pentosidine in human Bruch's membranes and to localize pentosidine and carboxymethyllysine (CML), two well-characterized, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in aged human Bruch's membranes and choroid in vivo.    METHODS: Human Bruch's membrane samples were isolated from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to determine pentosidine content. A polyclonal anti-pentosidine antibody and a monoclonal antibody specific for carboxymethyllysine were used to localize AGEs in 20-month-old nondiabetic, 82-year-old nondiabetic, and 82-year-old diabetic globes.    RESULTS: Human Bruch's membranes (n = 20) showed a linear age-dependent increase in pentosidine that reached approximately 0.17 millimoles pentosidine per mole hydroxyproline in late life (r = 0.896; P < 0.001). Immunohistochemical evaluation showed evidence of pentosidine in Bruch's memb…
7615349	Typical and optimal aging in women and men: is there a double standard?	aging	1995-??-??	Gender stereotypes of typical and optimal, mentally healthy aging were examined with sixty-year-old and seventy-five-year-old women, men and gender-unspecified older people as target persons. Respondents were young adult individuals (N = 232) and their older adult relatives/acquaintances (N = 233). Perceptions of typical aging varied depending on the age of the respondent, the target gender and the target age. Gender stereotypes were more pronounced than age stereotypes: respondents described same-gender targets more similarly than same-age targets. Older women were rated higher on dimensions related to nurturance while older men were rated higher on intellectual competence and autonomy. Perceptions of optimal aging were not found to be affected by the gender of the respondent or target. Views of optimal aging, however, were influenced by respondent and target age. These findings suggest a double standard of aging for typical but not for optimal aging.
8687024	Simultaneous increase of mitochondrial DNA deletions and lipid peroxidation in human aging.	aging	1996-06-15	Human mtDNA is a naked circular double-stranded DNA, which is continually exposed to the matrix that contains high levels of ROS and free radicals. High oxidative stress and a lack of proofreading during mtDNA replication and efficient DNA repair mechanisms in the mitochondria have rendered mtDNA extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage. More than one dozen large-scale deletions in mtDNA have been identified in various tissues of old humans. The 4,977-bp and 7,436-bp deletions are the most prevalent and abundant ones. The onset age of various mtDNA deletions varies greatly with tissues of each individual and type of deletion. In this and previous studies, we have demonstrated with PCR techniques that the frequency of occurrence and the proportion of the 4,977-bp and 7,436-bp deleted mtDNAs are significantly increased with the age of the human. The mtDNA deletions are not detectable in any tissues from young healthy subjects or blood cells from normal individuals of any age, which indic…
12907158	Human beta-crystallins modified by backbone cleavage, deamidation and oxidation are prone to associate.	aging	2003-09-??	Information about beta-crystallins and their post-translational modifications has been scarce because of difficulties in isolating the individual beta-crystallins. These difficulties arise because the beta-crystallin sequences are highly homologous and because beta-crystallins undergo many age-related modifications that lead to a variety of molecular masses and a range of acidities for each crystallin. In this study, human beta-crystallins were isolated using several steps of chromatography both before and after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Many previously unidentified in vivo modifications, including deamidations among all beta-crystallins except betaB3, truncation of betaA3, betaB1 and betaA4, and oxidation of some methionines and tryptophans were located among the isolated beta-crystallins. Many modifications occurred before age 20 with modest increases in modification for beta-crystallins from lenses 20-87 years old. The tendency of the modified beta-crystallins to form non…
17634323	Aging, resting metabolic rate, and oxidative damage: results from the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study.	aging	2007-07-??	BACKGROUND: The aging process occurs at variable rates both among and within species and may be related to the variability in oxygen consumption and free radical production impacting oxidative stress. The current study was designed to test whether nonagenarians have a relatively low metabolic rate and whether it is associated with low levels of oxidative stress relative to age.    METHODS: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and markers of oxidative stress to lipids, proteins, and DNA were measured in three groups of individuals aged 20-34 (n=47), 60-74 (n=49), and>or=90 years (n=74).    RESULTS: RMR, adjusted for fat-free mass, fat mass, and sex, was lower in both older groups when compared to the young group (p<or=.0001). There were no significant differences in urinary isoprostanes, serum protein carbonyls, or DNA fragmentation between groups, and RMR was not related to any markers of oxidative stress.    CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms an age-related decline in RMR independent of changes…
21640395	Healthy centenarians show high levels of circulating interleukin-22 (IL-22).	longevity, aging	????-??-??	Aging is characterized by a progressive alteration of homeostatic mechanisms modulated by environmental and genetic factors. It is associated with a pro-inflammatory status. In centenarians, an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine production balanced by anti-inflammatory immune response that would promote longevity is observed. Cytokine dysregulation is believed to play a key role in the proposed remodeling of the immune-inflammatory responses accompanying old age. IL-22 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family and represents an important effector molecule of activated T helper (Th)-22, Th-1, and Th-17 cells. We recruited 17 healthy centenarians (4 males, 13 females, range 100-105 years). All ultralongeval subjects were living at home or in a nursing home. Sixteen healthy, sex-matched individuals (4 males, 12 females, range 60-95 years) were also recruited as controls. Centenarians displayed significantly higher circulating IL-22 levels compared to control populati…
8168683	The concepts of successful and positive ageing.	lifespan	1993-12-??	Social scientists frequently refer to the 'greying' of the population in the west, the extension of the average lifespan to around the age of 76, and the projected increases in the numbers of people aged 85 and over, with the ensuing problems of chronic illness and disability that often accompany very old age. Increasing interest is being expressed in positive aspects of ageing: given the increases in life expectancy during this century, is it resulting in a life worth living? Concern is heightened by the estimate that, although most people aged 65+ live in their own homes and are relatively healthy and independent, years of disability can begin as early as 60 years. Conversely, some researchers and policy makers feel that enough time has been spent on the negative aspects of ageing and that the balance should be addressed by analysing successful, or positive ageing (sometimes defined in terms of an overlapping but separate dimension 'health-related quality of life'), with the aim of p…
11385075	An underfeeding study in healthy men and women provides further evidence of impaired regulation of energy expenditure in old age.	aging	2001-06-??	The effect of aging on energy regulation remains controversial. We compared the effects of underfeeding on changes in energy expenditure and respiratory quotient in young normal weight men and women [YNW, age 25.7 +/- 3.2 y(SD), body mass index (BMI) 23.1 +/- 1.6 kg/m(2)], young overweight men and women (YOW, age 26.1 +/- 3.5 y, BMI 27.7 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)) and older (OLD) men and women (age 68.4 +/- 3.3 y, BMI 27.4 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)). The thermic effect of feeding (TEF) during weight maintenance, and changes in resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient were determined in response to undereating by an average 3.75 MJ/d for 6 wk. In addition, body composition was measured. No significant differences among the groups were observed in TEF, fasting and postprandial respiratory quotient, or the change in fasting respiratory quotient with underfeeding. However, REE adjusted for fat-free mass and fat mass was significantly lower in OLD subjects compared with YNW and YOW subjects (P…
18708624	Mature enzymatic collagen cross-links, hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline, in the aging human vitreous.	aging	2009-03-??	PURPOSE: The vitreous body of the human eye undergoes progressive morphologic changes with aging. Since the enzymatic collagen cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and lysylpyridinoline (LP) are known to be important for the integrity of the collagen matrix, the presence in the vitreous on aging was studied.    METHODS: Vitreous bodies (VBs; n = 143) from 119 donors (age 4-80 years; mean +/- SD, 54.3 +/- 17.0 years) were carefully dissected. After weighing and freeze-drying, all samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Left and right eyes of 24 donors were compared and, for age-related phenomena, 119 single eyes were used.    RESULTS: Within one donor, no significant differences were found between left and right eyes. On aging, VB wet weight (4.42 +/- 0.84 g) accumulates until 35 years and decreases thereafter. Collagen content (0.30 +/- 0.14 mg), HP per triple helix (TH; 0.55 +/- 0.18), and (HP plus LP)/TH (0.61 +/- 0.19) increase until 50 years followed b…
19388007	Prevalence and longitudinal stability of negative symptoms in healthy participants.	aging	2009-12-??	OBJECTIVE: Although negative symptoms are prominent in older patients with schizophrenia, it is unknown whether this pattern is prevalent in healthy participants. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether negative symptoms are present in healthy populations and to determine whether they are linked to illness-related processes or normal aging.    METHODS: A systemic review of 26 studies that have administered negative symptom assessments to healthy participants was conducted. In addition, 213 (age > 40 years old) healthy participants completed PANSS and SANS ratings at both baseline and 1-year follow-up. One-hundred participants also completed ratings after 3 years.    RESULTS: Across all reviewed studies, negative symptoms were absent in the majority of participants. Comparable results were found in the current study's large longitudinal evaluation with middle-aged to older adults.    CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data suggest that healthy volunteers do not suffer from pro…
10999810	Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement administration: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in healthy elderly subjects.	aging	2000-09-??	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 50 and 25 mg) and placebo tablets were orally administered daily to 24 healthy aging men and women (67.8 +/- 4.3 yr) for 8 days according to a balanced incomplete block design. Nine blood tests on both the first and eighth days allowed the measurement of DHEA, its sulfate DHEAS, and metabolites: testosterone, 5alpha-androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol glucuronide, estradiol, and estrone. Relatively low background levels of DHEA(S) were observed, and with the reestablishment of "young" levels, four important results were obtained. 1) Blood DHEA had an apparent terminal half-life of more than 20 h, the same order of magnitude as that of blood DHEAS, a result explainable by back-hydrolysis of the large amount of DHEAS formed after oral administration of DHEA, a mechanism providing long-lived unconjugated DHEA and metabolites. 2) The metabolic conversion of DHEAS to DHEA was significantly greater in women than in men. 3) No accumulation of steroids was observed. 4) N…
15316021	Structure elucidation of a novel yellow chromophore from human lens protein.	aging	2004-10-29	We report here the isolation of a novel acid-labile yellow chromophore from the enzymatic digest of human lens proteins and the identification of its chemical structure by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and (1)H, (13)C, and two-dimensional NMR. This new chromophore exhibited a UV absorbance maximum at 343 nm and fluorescence at 410 nm when excited at 343 nm. Analysis of the purified compound by reversed-phase HPLC with in-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 370 Da. One- and two-dimensional NMR analyses elucidated the structure to be 1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-4-(5-amino-5-carboxypentylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydropyridinium, a cross-link between the epsilon-amino groups of two lysine residues, and a five-carbon ring. Because this cross-link contains two lysine residues and a dihydropyridinium ring, we assigned it the trivial name of K2P. Quantitative determinations of K2P in individual nor…
3107776	Effect of aging on vitamin D stores and bone density in women.	aging	1987-05-??	It has been suggested that the decrease in vitamin D stores with aging is a contributory cause of age-related osteoporosis. We studied this question by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of the mid-radius, distal radius, and lumbar spine assessed by single and dual photon absorptiometry in 122 women, aged 33-94 years, selected from a random sample of Rochester, MN residents. We measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the major storage form of vitamin D, as well as 25OHD3 (representing both endogenous and exogenous sources of vitamin D), and 25OHD2 (representing only exogenous sources). Both baseline serum total 25OHD (r = -0.29, P less than 0.001) and the metabolite 25OHD3 (r = -0.41, P less than 0.001), were negatively associated with age at baseline. After adjusting for the effect of age by multiple regression analysis, there was no association between serum levels of 25OHD2, 25OHD3, or total 25OHD and BMD for any of the three skeletal scanning sites. Thus, in a northern Americ…
21871552	Design, recruitment, logistics, and data management of the GEHA (Genetics of Healthy Ageing) project.	longevity	2011-11-??	In 2004, the integrated European project GEHA (Genetics of Healthy Ageing) was initiated with the aim of identifying genes involved in healthy ageing and longevity. The first step in the project was the recruitment of more than 2500 pairs of siblings aged 90 years or more together with one younger control person from 15 areas in 11 European countries through a coordinated and standardised effort. A biological sample, preferably a blood sample, was collected from each participant, and basic physical and cognitive measures were obtained together with information about health, life style, and family composition. From 2004 to 2008 a total of 2535 families comprising 5319 nonagenarian siblings were identified and included in the project. In addition, 2548 younger control persons aged 50-75 years were recruited. A total of 2249 complete trios with blood samples from at least two old siblings and the younger control were formed and are available for genetic analyses (e.g. linkage studies and …
21873681	Photochemical properties of UV Filter molecules of the human eye.	aging	2011-09-29	PURPOSE: To compare the photochemical properties of UV filter molecules present in the human lens (kynurenine, KN; 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3OHKN; 3-hydroxykynurenine O-β-D-glucoside, 3OHKG; 4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid, AHA; and glutathionyl-kynurenine, GSH-KN) with the use of the following parameters: excited singlet lifetime τ(S), fluorescence quantum yield Φ(fl), triplet quantum yield Φ(T), and photodecomposition quantum yield Φ(dec).    METHODS: The excited singlet lifetimes were measured with the use of fluorescence upconversion (time resolution, 210 fs) and pump-probe transient absorption (time resolution, 200 fs) methods. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined relative to an aqueous solution of quinine bisulfate. The triplet quantum yields were measured with the use of nanosecond laser flash photolysis. The photodecomposition quantum yields were determined by steady state photolysis followed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.    RESULTS: The se…
11266671	Mechanical energy analysis identifies compensatory strategies in disabled elders' gait.	aging	2001-04-??	Current concepts in disablement emphasize the importance of identifying mobility impairments in aging humans to enable timely intervention and, ultimately, prevent disability. Because mobility impairments are likely to result in compensatory movement strategies, recognizing and understanding those strategies may be critical in designing effective interventions for preventing disability. We sought to determine if mechanical energy methods are useful for identifying and understanding lower extremity compensatory movement strategies due to disabilities. Aleshinski's method was used to compute mechanical energy expenditure (MEE) and mechanical energy compensation (MEC) for the sagittal plane stance leg and low-back joints of healthy elders (HE) and disabled elders (DE) during preferred speed and paced (120 steps min(-1)) gait. DE subjects expended less ankle energy in late-stance and more low-back energy in mid-stance than did the HE subjects. When controlling for walking speed, the differ…
7484921	Influence of age on energy requirements.	aging	1995-??-??	The effects of aging on energy requirements and energy expenditure were investigated in 35 healthy young men (mean +/- SE age, 22.7 +/- 0.6 y) and elderly men (68.0 +/- 1.5 y). Over a 10-d metabolic balance study, measurements were made of metabolizable energy intake for weight maintenance, total energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure, and thermic effect of feeding. Values for both metabolizable energy intake and total energy expenditure were significantly higher than the current recommended dietary allowance for energy in both age groups (P < 0.01). Total energy expenditures were 14.48 +/- 0.65 and 11.26 +/- 5.40 MJ/d in young and elderly men, respectively. The difference in total energy expenditure between the groups was accounted for by a significant decrease in all the major components of expenditure. These results suggest that the current recommended dietary allowances for energy may underestimate the usual energy needs of healthy adult men.
20504153	Oxidation and reduction of cysteines in the intermembrane space of mitochondria: multiple facets of redox control.	aging	2010-11-01	Eukaryotic cells employ a large variety of protein modifications to integrate individual protein activities into regulatory or signaling networks. Thereby, different compartments prefer specific types of protein modifications. For example, protein phosphorylation is a highly frequent modification in the cytosol and the nucleus, whereas in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, protein functions may be predominantly regulated by protein oxidation or glycosylation. On the hundreds of mitochondrial proteins, only very few modifications were reported until very recently. This is particularly true for proteins of the intermembrane space, the compartment between the outer and inner membrane. However, studies over the last 5 years suggest that the introduction of disulfide bonds might regulate a variety of processes in this compartment. The different processes for which such redox regulations were shown or proposed include the import and folding of proteins and the assembly of cofactors of r…
8781290	31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of human liver in elderly patients: changes according to nutritional status and inflammatory state.	aging	1996-09-??	Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to determine the phosphorylated metabolite content in the liver of elderly patients in various nutritional states: normal, with protein deprivation, and with acute inflammatory syndrome. 31P-MRS investigations were performed at 1.5 T, and localized liver spectra were recorded using a two-dimensional chemical shift imaging sequence. Comparison to control spectra recorded on 10 healthy volunteers (age, 30.5 +/- 2.1 years) showed that the aging process does not significantly modify 31P-MRS liver spectra. Patients with protein deprivation exhibited a higher value than controls for the phosphomonoesters/nucleoside triphosphates (PME/NTP) ratio (P < .05). This increase was not due to the decrease of NTP, since the ratio of inorganic phosphate to NTP (Pi/NTP) remained constant. A decrease in the phosphodiesters to NTP (PDE/NTP) ratio (P < .04) contributed to the observed increase in the PME/PDE ratio (P < .01). In contrast, no significant differe…
11328743	Argpyrimidine, a blue fluorophore in human lens proteins: high levels in brunescent cataractous lenses.	aging	2001-05-??	PURPOSE: To determine whether the human lens contains argpyrimidine, a modification of arginine by methylglyoxal, to establish how argpyrimidine content relates to lens aging and cataract formation.    METHODS: A monoclonal antibody was used to measure argpyrimidine by a competitive ELISA in water soluble (WS) and insoluble (WI) lens fractions from young, aged, nuclear cataractous, and brunescent cataractous lenses. Brunescent cataractous lens proteins were digested by enzymes, the digest was subjected to HPLC, and the eluate was analyzed for argpyrimidine. Lens proteins from aged lenses (from donors 65 to 80 years of age) were fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column, and the crystallins were tested for argpyrimidine.    RESULTS: The competitive ELISA showed two to three times as much argpyrimidine in water-insoluble proteins as in water-soluble proteins. Although no clear cut increase with the age of the lens donors in either the water-soluble or the insoluble protein fractions was fo…
21720203	Dysexecutive performance of healthy oldest old subjects on the Frontal Assessment Battery.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Frontal lobes and executive functions appear to be more vulnerable to normal aging than other cerebral regions and domains. The aim of the study was to evaluate executive functions by the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) in healthy oldest old subjects free of dementia.    METHODS: Thirty-two healthy oldest old subjects (age range 85-97 yrs) and 32 young old subjects (aged 61-74 yrs) were studied. All subjects were living with their families or alone and were considered normal, since they were fully independent in their activities of daily living and without signs or symptoms characteristic of any type of dementia. Mental status was assessed by the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and executive functions by the FAB.    RESULTS: Mean MMSE scores were 23.12 ± 4.68 in oldest old and 26.78 ± 2.60 in young old subjects (p<0.005). Delayed recall was the most impaired domain, followed by executive (Serial 7). Mean FAB scores were 9.37 ± 4.14 in the oldest old and 13.5…
19298006	A comparison of physiological variables in aged and young women during and following submaximal exercise.	aging	????-??-??	Previously, we have examined how aging affects the physiological responses of men to endurance exercise. In the present investigation, we aimed to extend our assessment of the influence of aging on exercise-induced responses by focusing on women. Ten young (20.3 +/- 0.3 years; mean +/- SE) and 10 aged (75.5 +/- 1.2 years) women performed 30 min of cycling at 60-65% of their predetermined peak oxygen uptake. Data for respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate, blood pressure, rectal temperature, and plasma metabolites were collected before exercise, at the 15th and 30th min of exercise, and at 5 and 15 min postexercise. A two-way, repeated measures ANOVA with main effects of age and time was conducted on each variable. Our findings showed that age affected exercise-induced responses of each variable quantified. Although RER, heart rate, temperature, and lactate were significantly (P < 0.05) higher among young women, blood pressure and glucose values were greater among aged women. More…
14741654	Interindividual differences of medial temporal lobe activation during encoding in an elderly population studied by fMRI.	aging	2004-01-??	Functional MRI (fMRI) is used to study medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation during encoding of new information into memory. In most studies, fMRI data of different subjects are averaged in standard coordinate space. However, interindividual differences in activation can be extensive, reflecting functional heterogeneity. Further, anatomical differences in brain structure cause additional variance and loss of registration accuracy. Such differences in structural and functional MTL characteristics may interfere with the efficiency of averaging data across subjects, and may become more significant with aging and dementia. The current study concerns the analysis of individual differences in MTL activation associated with episodic encoding.Twenty-nine healthy elderly men between 60 and 70 years old performed a simple face encoding task during fMRI scanning. Individual data were analyzed in native space, and compared to the group average in standard space (Talairach and Tournoux).MTL volumes…
21453015	Level of physical activity at the age of 65 predicts successful aging seven years later: the PROOF study.	aging	2011-04-??	BACKGROUND: Physical activity has a pleiotropic effect and is a significant factor in successful aging. This study aims to quantify the relationship between the physical activity of a 65-year-old cohort and the level of life satisfaction and self-rated health 7 years later.    METHODS: A total of 988 questionnaires were sent by mail to a representative sample of healthy pensioners. Life satisfaction and health status were estimated on two visual analogical scales in answer to the following questions: (1) How would you estimate your state of health? and (2) Are you generally satisfied with your life? The level of physical activity was estimated using a questionnaire which enabled us to calculate: (1) Daily energy expenditure (DEE), (2) physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), (3) daily energy expenditure higher than 5 metabolic equivalents (METs) (DEQisa), (4) Activity index (PAEE/DEE), (5) VO(2) peak.    RESULTS: In all, 686 responses were validated. The average age was 72.9 ± 1.2 …
8077303	Complex alteration of thyroid function in healthy centenarians.	aging	1993-11-??	Several changes in thyroid function have been described in the elderly and largely attributed to concomitant nonthyroidal illness. The extent to which aging per se contributes to these changes remains to be elucidated, and scanty data are available in extremely old subjects. The present study was designed to focus on thyroid function during physiological aging, taking advantage of two groups of selected aged individuals: group A of healthy centenarians (n = 41; age range, 100-110 yr) and group B including healthy elderly subjects selected by the criteria of the EURAGE SENIEUR protocol (n = 33; age range, 65-80 yr). Control groups included 98 healthy normal adult subjects (group C; age range, 20-64 yr) and 52 patients with miscellaneous nonthyroidal illness (group D; age range, 28-82 yr). Our previous report of a low prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in centenarians was confirmed and extended by the finding of a similar low autoantibody prevalence in the highly selected healthy elder…
9702175	Age-related changes in human lens crystallins identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry.	aging	1998-07-??	Analysis of water-soluble crystallins from human lenses, ages 32 week fetal to 55 years has led to identification of the major modifications of the proteins comprising the lens. These modifications were identified by the masses of the proteins determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry after the proteins were separated by gel filtration and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Examination of all the proteins isolated from the water soluble portion demonstrated that the major age-related modifications causing significant alteration in the molecular weights of the lens crystallins include truncation of the N-termini of beta B1, beta A3 and beta A1, and partial phosphorylation and C-terminal degradation of alpha-crystallins. N-terminal degradation of beta B1, beta A3 and beta A1 was evident in human lenses less than one year old, and the proportion of these truncated proteins became greater with age. Phosphorylation of alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins increa…
19047812	Variation rhythms of lymphocyte subsets during healthy aging.	aging	2008-??-??	Immunological alterations associated with aging (immunosenescence) do not represent a simple unidirectional decline in all functions but develop as a complex remodeling of the immune system, involving multiple reorganization and developmentally regulated changes. In general, most data available about aging were obtained at particular age intervals and most of them come from Caucasian individuals from either Europe or the United States. Here, we report the frequencies of major lymphocyte subsets in healthy Brazilian individuals from 2 distinct geographic regions (Southeast and South) at several age intervals spanning a lifetime period (0-86 years). Overall, we demonstrated that changes in the frequencies of cells related to both innate and adaptive immunity clearly occur with aging in these individuals. These changes were not progressive and equally steady for all cell populations tested but instead showed an oscillatory or rhythmic behavior that was distinctive of each population at di…
16720742	The endeavor of high maintenance homeostasis: resting metabolic rate and the legacy of longevity.	longevity, aging	2006-05-??	Metabolism, the continuous conversion between structural molecules and energy, is life in essence. Size, metabolic rate, and maximum life span appear to be inextricably interconnected in all biological organisms and almost follow a "universal" law. The notion of metabolic rate as the natural "rate of living" filled most of the academic discussion on aging in the early 20th century to be later replaced by the free-radical theory of aging. We argue that the rate of living theory was discarded too quickly and that studying factors affecting resting metabolic rate during the aging process may provide great insight into the core mechanisms explaining differential longevity between individuals, and possibly the process leading to frailty. We predict that measures of resting metabolic rate will be introduced in geriatric clinical practice to gather information on the degree of multisystem dysregulation, exhaustion of energy reserve, and risk of irreversible frailty.
12684796	Reduced oxidative power but unchanged antioxidative capacity in skeletal muscle from aged humans.	aging	2003-05-??	The hypothesis that the aging process is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been investigated in human skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsy samples were taken from seven old male subjects [OS; 75 (range 61-86) years] and eight young male subjects [YS; 25 (22-31) years]. Oxidative function was measured both in permeabilised muscle fibres and isolated mitochondria. Despite matching the degree of physical activity, OS had a lower training status than YS as judged from pulmonary maximal O(2) consumption ( Vdot;O(2)max, -36%) and handgrip strength (-20%). Both maximal respiration and creatine-stimulated respiration were reduced in muscle fibres from OS (-32 and -34%, respectively). In contrast, respiration in isolated mitochondria was similar in OS and YS. The discrepancy might be explained by a biased harvest of "healthy" mitochondria and/or disruption of structural components during the process of isolation. Cytochrome C oxidase was reduced (-40%, P<0.01), wherea…
22520853	Episodic autobiographical memory in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment: a population-based study.	aging	2012-12-30	While episodic memory impairment has been extensively studied in normal and pathological aging, studies investigating age-related episodic autobiographical memory among representative samples are scarce. We therefore investigated episodic autobiographical memory in a sample of 395 participants of a population-based prospective study of aging. Three groups were compared, consisting of 194 middle-aged participants, 138 healthy old-aged participants and 63 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results showed a significant impairment of episodic autobiographical memory performance associated with MCI, but not with normal aging. These deficits were significantly correlated with verbal memory performances, but not with measures of executive functions.
16267187	Age-related differences in the areas of Broca and Wernicke using functional magnetic resonance imaging.	aging	2005-11-??	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified differences in the brain activation pattern between children and adults as well as between healthy subjects and patients using various imaging methods. Despite the increase of old people in the population, at present no study has applied a language task to investigate differences in adults.    OBJECTIVE: We used a simple paradigm to elicit activation in young and old adults to investigate differences in the activation of the classical Broca and Wernicke areas.    METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we applied a simple language paradigm to 10 right-handed subjects in each age group. Words and letter strings were presented separately with the instruction to decide for each pair if it represents a synonym (in case of words) or identical strings (in case of letters). The corresponding changes in the brain activation for words and letters were contrasted for each individual subject and compared by statistical parametric methods.…
21331458	Age-related differences on event-related potentials and brain rhythm oscillations during working memory activation.	aging	2011-06-??	Previous functional imaging studies have pointed to the compensatory recruitment of cortical circuits in old age in order to counterbalance the loss of neural efficiency and preserve cognitive performance. Recent electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses reported age-related deficits in the amplitude of an early positive-negative working memory (PN(wm)) component as well as changes in working memory (WM)-load related brain oscillations during the successful performance of the n-back task. To explore the age-related differences of EEG activation in the face of increasing WM demands, we assessed the PN(wm) component area, parietal alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) as well as frontal theta ERS in 32 young and 32 elderly healthy individuals who successfully performed a highly WM demanding 3-back task. PN(wm) area increased with higher memory loads (3- and 2-back > 0-back tasks) in younger subjects. Older subjects reached the maximal values for this EEG parameter during the less WM dem…
20177134	Exercise, physiological function, and the selection of participants for aging research.	aging	2010-08-??	BACKGROUND: Regular and vigorous exercisers appear to be the logical choice for studying the inherent aging process as they are essentially free from the complications of disuse. Cross-sectional studies of aging tend to depict an essentially smooth and progressive decrement of physiological function with increasing chronological age. On closer examination of such data, it is seen that although the young have high functional values and the very old low, between these limits, values are widely scattered.    METHODS: We have reevaluated published data from a meta-analysis of 242 studies on men and from a similar study on women. From both data sets, where VO2max was plotted against chronological age, we stratified the VO2max values into bandwidth intervals of 5 ml/kg/minute and then allocated data points to their respective bandwidth irrespective of chronological age.    RESULTS: When replotted into bandwidths of functional equivalence, these data show that at the extremes of function, the…
12393957	Ageing and longevity are related to growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion.	longevity	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: It is known that the growth process is related to an individual's life-span, but the role of growth hormone (GH) secretion in human ageing remains unknown.    OBJECTIVE: This study has focussed on the influence of GH on ageing parameters and on its relationship with human longevity.    METHODS: To deal with the first issue, we compared ageing parameters of young (up to 39) and old (over 70) individuals having similar insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) blood levels. For the second one, the decline in IGF-1 levels was studied comparing its behaviour in the first half with that in the second half of adult life. The latter represents the period of life in which mortality progressively increases. Two hundred and five healthy individuals were chosen as subjects, well distributed by gender and age (between 19 and 93 years).    RESULTS: Old males with IGF-1 levels similar to young ones do not show the age-dependent decrease in serum testosterone and lean body mass, nor the increa…
11772512	Human CD4+ T cell clone longevity in tissue culture: lack of influence of donor age or cell origin.	longevity	????-??-??	CD4+ human T cell clones were derived from activated peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy young adults to establish cloning efficiencies (CE) and clonal longevities. These results were compared with those obtained using cells from the very elderly, also in excellent health. CE and both maximal and average longevities under appropriate culture conditions were very similar in the two groups. Moreover, CE of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and longevities of clones derived from them were also similar. Finally, CE and longevities of clones derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukaemia were found to be comparable as well. Hence, T cells with absolutely no antigenic exposure in vivo prior to cloning (i.e. CD34-derived) and those potentially exposed to chronic antigenic stimulation (CML-derived) and those from young or old donors all had similar cloning and propagation properties in vitro. These results imply that the longevity of T cells in culture is more likely to be di…
16733495	PTCA determination in human hair: reliability and analytical aspects.	aging	2006-06-??	BACKGROUND: In this study we analysed the reliability of HPLC determination of 2.3.5-pyrroletricarboxylic acid (PTCA). This product derives from oxidation of melanin in human hair, and is a good candidate as a risk marker for skin tumors.    MATERIAL/METHODS: We determined PTCA in 100 melanoma cases and 100 controls, 21 replicates from six different reference hairs, two trace elements, and one reference sample (brown hair).    RESULTS: Work-up procedures showed an almost perfect reproducibility with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.990. We noticed a low, detectable, but not statistically significant decrease in reproducibility proportional to the amount of PTCA. Agreement between determination following injection of the same solution in HPLC column was also high, with an overall ICC of 0.986. Simultaneous analysis of reproducibility showed a partial ICC for work-up (0.986), for injection (0.987), and an overall standardised ICC (0.975). The analysis of the two reference…
11353009	Age-related changes in lower trunk coordination and energy transfer during gait.	aging	2001-05-??	The effects of aging on lower trunk (trunk-low-back joint-pelvis) coordination and energy transfer during locomotion has received little attention; consequently, there are scant biomechanical data available for comparison with patient populations whose upper body movements may be impaired by orthopaedic or neurologic disorders. To address this problem, we analyzed gait data from a cross-sectional sample of healthy adults (n = 93) between 20 and 90 yr old (n = 44 elderly, >50 yr old; n = 49 young, <50 yr old). Gait characteristics of elders were mostly typical: gait speed of elders (1.13 +/- 0.20 m/s) was significantly (P = 0.007) lower than gait speed of young subjects (1.20 +/- 0.18 m/s). Although elders had less low-back (trunk relative to pelvis) range of motion (ROM; P = 0.013) during gait than young subjects, no age-related differences were detected in absolute trunk and pelvis ROM or peak pitch angles during gait. Despite similar upper body postures, there was a strong associatio…
20625806	Successful aging through the eyes of Alaska Natives: exploring generational differences among Alaska Natives.	aging	2010-12-??	There is very little research on Alaska Native (AN) elders and how they subjectively define a successful older age. The lack of a culturally-specific definition often results in the use of a generic definition that portrays Alaska Native elders as aging less successfully than their White counterparts. However, there is a very limited understanding of a diverse array of successful aging experiences across generations. This research explores the concept of successful aging from an Alaska Native perspective, or what it means to age well in Alaska Native communities. An adapted Explanatory Model (EM) approach was used to gain a sense of the beliefs about aging from Alaska Natives. Research findings indicate that aging successfully is based on local understandings about personal responsibility and making the conscious decision to live a clean and healthy life, abstaining from drugs and alcohol. The findings also indicate that poor aging is often characterized by a lack of personal responsib…
16333763	At the heart of aging: is it metabolic rate or stability?	aging	2005-??-??	Foundational changes in science are rare, but in the field of biogerontology there is a new theory of aging that may shake things up. The conventional wisdom about duration of life is based on an old idea known as the "rate of living" theory, which suggests that aging is caused by the loss of some vital substance. The modern version of this theory is that duration of life is influenced by the relative speed of a species' resting metabolism. However, empirical evidence does not consistently support this hypothesis. In an article published recently by mathematician/biologist Lloyd Demetrius, it is suggested that the most important factor involved in duration of life is not metabolic rate or oxidative stress, but metabolic stability. If Demetrius is correct, his theory will have important implications for intervention research. For example, if the metabolic rate/oxidative stress theory is correct, efforts to intervene in the aging process should be directed at finding ways to reduce metab…
3492786	Reduction in regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen during human aging.	aging	????-??-??	To investigate changes in cerebral circulation and oxygen metabolism during aging, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were measured using the 15O labelled gas inhalation technique and a multi-slice positron emission tomograph (PET) in 22 healthy volunteers, aged from 26 to 64 years old. The measurements were performed with subjects at rest, without sensory deprivation. The values of rCBF, rOEF, rCMRO2 and rCBV in more than 40 anatomical structures of the brain were evaluated by studying a large series of scans in each region of interest after the functional PET image had been anatomically identified using x-ray computed tomographic images corresponding to the PET. In mean gray values, only CMRO2 showed significant reduction with age. rCMRO2 significantly decreased with age only in the supratentrium, and much more in the left hemisphere. Especially …
16299416	Aging: functional metabolic balance among cAMP, cGMP and reactive oxygen intermediate generation by human granulocytes.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: The nature of the aging process has been the subject of considerable speculation. It has been reported that in the aging process several components of the signal transduction pathways, including phosphoinositide, protein kinase C, protein kinase A and reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) generation, are altered.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional metabolic balance among cAMP, cGMP and ROI generation by human neutrophils in relation to age.    METHODS: The age-induced ROI generation was studied in healthy subjects ranging in age from 20 to 80 years old, divided into 6 age groups: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70-80 years old. The oxidizing cellular generation was quantified in a luminol-dependent (ROI production) chemiluminescence assay and the results expressed as relative light units per minute.    RESULTS: Our results show a differential functional metabolic balance of cAMP and cGMP in relation to age from 50 years on. This phenomenon …
3972962	Effects of aging on catecholamine metabolism.	aging	1985-03-??	To determine the cause of the high plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in elderly subjects, we measured apparent NE secretion, NE plasma clearance, and NE production in 14 young and 13 elderly normal subjects. Apparent NE secretion, estimated by isotope dilution analysis, was higher (P less than 0.01) in the elderly subjects [3.08 +/- 0.45 (+/- SEM) nmol/m2 X min] than in the young subjects (1.84 +/- 0.12 nmol/m2 X min). Plasma clearance of NE did not differ between the young (1470 +/- 120 ml/m2 X min) and the elderly (1295 +/- 153) subjects. NE production, estimated from NE metabolite excretion, was 9.66 +/- 0.8 nmol/m2 X min in the elderly subjects, not significantly different from that in the young subjects, who produced NE at a rate of 11.7 +/- 1.1 nmol/m2 X min. Excretion of the O-methyl derivative of NE normetanephrine was increased (P less than 0.01) in the aged, whereas excretion of the deaminated metabolites vanillylmandelic acid and dihydroxmandelic acid was decreased. …
15716035	Modifications in the myogenic program induced by in vivo and in vitro aging.	lifespan, aging	2005-02-28	In this study, we have used high density cDNA arrays to assess age-related changes in gene expression in the myogenic program of human satellite cells and to elucidate modifications in differentiation capacity that could occur throughout in vitro cellular aging. We have screened a collection of 2016 clones from a human skeletal muscle 3'-end cDNA library in order to investigate variations in the myogenic program of myotubes formed by the differentiation of myoblasts of individuals with different ages (5 days old, 52 years old and 79 years old) and induced to differentiate at different stages of their lifespan (early proliferation, presenescence and senescence). Although our analysis has not been able to underline specific changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in muscle structure and/or function, we have demonstrated an age-related induction of genes involved in stress response and a down-regulation of genes involved both in mitochondrial electron transport/ATP s…
15592730	Quantitative MR analyses of the hippocampus: unspecific metabolic changes in aging.	aging	2004-11-??	The age-related structural changes of the human hippocampus are not entirely understood. The goal of the present investigation was to understand better the nature of age-related hippocampal changes by a comparative MR-analysis of four complementary aspects of hippocampal integrity: total volume, metabolite concentration, neuron to glial cell ratio and amount of extracellular diffusion space for water. To that end, we applied MR-based methods of manual and computerized (voxel-based morphometry) volumetry, diffusion-weighted imaging and 1H MR spectroscopy to characterize specific age-related hippocampal effects in a group of 22 healthy old adults in comparison with a group of 13 healthy younger adults. Age-related reductions of the hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate to creatine/choline ratio together with only marginal age-related reductions in hippocampal volumes and increases in diffusion parameters suggest that the process of aging affects mainly the metabolic status of the hippocampus wi…
19519700	Social relationships influencing positive perceived health among Thai older persons: a secondary data analysis using the National Elderly Survey.	aging	2009-06-??	This study examined the associations between social relationships and positive perceived health among Thai older persons. The data were taken from the 2002 National Elderly Survey in Thailand. The sample of this study included 24 664 elders aged > or = 60 years. Multiple logistic regression models were employed in this secondary analysis of the national database. The findings revealed that friendship networks, informational and emotional support, and social engagements are positively associated with good perceived health. In addition, for individual pathways, the more that elders engage with regular exercise, prepare for healthy aging, and enjoy psychological well-being, the better they perceive their health to be. There was strong evidence that friendship interactions, social support, and healthy behaviors have a significant association with perceived good health. Health-care professionals should target the promotion of friendship networks, social support, and health-promoting behavio…
16955215	Polymorphisms in MT1a gene coding region are associated with longevity in Italian Central female population.	longevity	????-??-??	Metallothioneins (MTs) play a pivotal role in zinc-related cell homeostasis because of their high affinity for zinc, which is in turn fundamental for immune response and antioxidant activity. MTs regulate zinc homeostasis by binding zinc and releasing zinc at the occurrence for immune response. The zinc release by MT is very limited in chronic inflammation and ageing. Some polymorphisms of MTs gene, in particular MT1a sub-isoform, may affect this release that is a problem still unresolved in ageing. The screening in the present paper of two polymorphisms in MT1a gene has revealed for the first time that the polymorphism corresponding to a A/C (Asp/Thr) transition at 647 nt position in the Mt1a coding region is the more involved in the longevity, at least in old women, rather than the other corresponding to A/G (Lys/Arg) transition at 1,245 nt position. Concomitantly, for the +647 MT1a polymorphism, old and very old female with Asp/Asp genotype (called C-carriers) display higher zinc re…
8994362	Increase in the intramolecular disulfide bonding of alpha-A crystallin during aging of the human lens.	aging	1996-11-??	Aging of the normal human lens is accompanied by oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups to disulfide groups. Although this has been known for many years, very little is known about the exact amino acid residues involved. In addition, almost nothing is known concerning the temporal sequence of this oxidative process over the lifetime of the individual. To address these two concerns for alpha-A crystallin, the polypeptide was purified from total proteins of the human lens, followed by digestion with lys-C endoprotease. Mass spectral analysis of the resulting fragments demonstrated that the two cysteine residues (cysteine-131 and cysteine-142) are present as a mixture of an intramolecular disulfide bond and free sulfhydryl groups. Reverse phase chromatography was used to resolve and quantitate the relative amounts of the two forms present in alpha-A crystallin from normal lenses of different age. Even in very young lenses (4 months and 5 months of age) there is significant oxidation of th…
9543170	Age-related changes in glucocorticoid fast feedback inhibition of adrenocorticotropin in man.	aging	1998-04-??	A decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback suppression seems to occur with aging. To investigate possible abnormalities in the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on ACTH secretion in the elderly, we evaluated the endogenous ACTH response to hydrocortisone (25 mg as an i.v. bolus) in 15 healthy aged (65-88 yr) and 15 healthy young (18-26 yr) men. Blood samples for ACTH and cortisol determinations were collected at -15, 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. Hydrocortisone injection produced a rapid increase in plasma cortisol levels within the first 2 min in both groups. In old men, in concomitance with the cortisol increase, ACTH levels showed only a slight and nonsignificant decrease within the first 15 min, followed by a pronounced and significant decline thereafter. In young subjects, in concomitance with the plasma cortisol increase, a marked decrease in ACTH levels was observed within the first 15 min, followed by a less …
6327768	Impaired vitamin D metabolism with aging in women. Possible role in pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis.	aging	1984-06-??	Calcium absorption decreases with aging, particularly after age 70 yr. We investigated the possibility that this was due to abnormal vitamin D metabolism by studying 10 normal premenopausal women (group A), 8 normal postmenopausal women within 20 yr of menopause (group B), 10 normal elderly women (group C), and 8 elderly women with hip fracture (group D) whose ages (mean +/- SD) were 37 +/- 4, 61 +/- 6, 78 +/- 4, and 78 +/- 4 yr, respectively. For all subjects, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] did not decrease with age, but serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the physiologically active vitamin D metabolite, was lower (P = 0.01) in the elderly (groups C and D; 20 +/- 3 pg/ml) than in the nonelderly (groups A and B; 35 +/- 4 pg/ml). The increase of serum 1,25(OH)D after a 24-h infusion of bovine parathyroid hormone fragment 1-34, a tropic agent for the enzyme 25(OH)D 1 alpha-hydroxylase, correlated inversely with age (r = -0.58; P less than 0.001) and directly with glomerular …
11041077	Regulation of energy intake in relation to metabolic state and nutritional status.	aging	2000-06-??	Inadequate energy intake can be an important contributor to weight loss in older individuals. This review highlights recent studies on possible causes of negative energy balance in older individuals. Studies of the regulation of food intake suggest that aging is associated with a significant impairment in the regulation of food intake that inhibits appropriate short-term and long-term compensation for imposed alterations in energy intake. The combination of a reduced ability to regulate energy intake, decreased sensory-specific satiety, and disadvantageous social factors such as functional limitations, social isolation and depression, increases the risk of negative energy balance leading to weight loss in older individuals.
10594162	Circulating beta(2) microglobulin in relation to bone metabolism: implications for bone loss with aging.	aging	1999-12-??	The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationships between circulating beta(2) microglobulin (beta(2) m) and bone mineral density (BMD), parameters of bone remodeling, vitamin D metabolites, parathyroid hormone (PTH), estradiol levels, and age in a group of 165 clinically healthy or osteoporotic, but otherwise normal untreated women. In this group of women, systemic beta(2) m correlated with BMD (g/cm(2)) levels for total hip and Ward's triangle (r = -0.298, P < 0.0001; and r = -0.299, P < 0.0001, respectively), but only at the borderline level with BMD at the spine (r = -0.145, P = 0.0604). Serum beta(2) microglobulin markedly correlated with age (r = 0.512, P = 0.0001). beta(2) m levels correlated with indices of bone remodeling, as well as with serum creatinine and estradiol levels. However, after stratification of all analyses by age, body mass index, and serum 25OHD(3), 1, 25(OH)(2)D(3), PTH, or estradiol levels (using standard multiple regression and stepwise…
12841596	Age-associated decrease of oxidative repair enzymes, human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases (hOgg1), in human aging.	aging	2003-03-??	8-Oxoguanine has been shown to be a dominant cause of oxidative DNA damage by oxygen free radicals in eukaryotic cells. The 8-oxoguanine repair-specific enzyme 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (hOgg1) was recently cloned and was observed to conduct mainly short-patch base-excision repair. It has also been suggested that reactive oxygen species play an important role in the cellular aging process. We explored the association between the hOgg1 enzyme activity in somatic cells of human subjects of various ages and the role of hOgg1(326) genetic polymorphism. An 8-oxoguanine-containing 28 mer oligonucleotide was end-labeled with gamma-32P ATP and incubated with protein extracts from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 78 healthy individuals ranging in age from newborn to 91 years old. The hOgg1 repair activity toward the radiolabelled 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA was determined, and the results indicated a significant age-dependent decrease in the hOgg1 activity in their lymphocytes. Signif…
20404395	Why human lifespan is rapidly increasing: solving "longevity riddle" with "revealed-slow-aging" hypothesis.	longevity, aging	2010-04-??	Healthy life span is rapidly increasing and human aging seems to be postponed. As recently exclaimed in Nature, these findings are so perplexing that they can be dubbed the 'longevity riddle'. To explain current increase in longevity, I discuss that certain genetic variants such as hyper-active mTOR (mTarget of Rapamycin) may increase survival early in life at the expense of accelerated aging. In other words, robustness and fast aging may be associated and slow-aging individuals died prematurely in the past. Therefore, until recently, mostly fast-aging individuals managed to survive into old age. The progress of civilization (especially 60 years ago) allowed slow-aging individuals to survive until old age, emerging as healthy centenarians now. I discuss why slow aging is manifested as postponed (healthy) aging, why the rate of deterioration is independent from aging and also entertain hypothetical use of rapamycin in different eras as well as the future of human longevity.
6660481	Separation of hemoglobin types by cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography.	aging	1983-10-01	The use of a recently developed cation-exchange HPLC packing material for the separation of hemoglobin types in human blood has been investigated. Adult and newborn hemolysates from normal individuals and from subjects with hemoglobin disorders were analyzed using a weak cation carboxymethyl-bonded phase on 5-micron-particle-size silica. Elution was accomplished using a Bistris (2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1, 3-propanediol) gradient. Seven well-resolved HbA1 fractions eluted before the major HbA peak. Hbs A1a, A1b, A1c and an HbA1 fraction that increased with aging of the hemolysates were separately eluted. HbF when present or when added to the hemolysates eluted as a distinct peak. HbA was followed by Hbs A2, S, and C when present. An early-eluting peak corresponding to Hb Bart's was identified in newborn hemolysates. It is concluded that cation-exchange HPLC provides a new tool for the reliable separation of minor hemoglobin components.
20061192	Volatile profiles of human skin cell cultures in different degrees of senescence.	aging	2010-02-01	It is known that skin releases volatile organic compounds to the environment, and also that its emission pattern changes with aging of the skin. It could be considered, that these compounds are intermediaries in cell metabolism, since many intermediaries of metabolic pathways have a volatile potential. In this work, a simple and non-destructive method consisting of SPME sampling and GC/MS analysis was developed to identify volatile organic emanations from cell cultures. This technique, applied to skin cells culture, indicates that the cells or cell metabolism produce several skin emissions. Chemometric analysis was performed in order to explore the relationship between a volatile profile and the senescence of cell cultures. Volatile profiles were different for cell cultures in different degrees of senescence, indicating that volatile compound patterns could be used to provide information about the age of skin cells.
8729920	Glottal airflow characteristics of women's voice production along an aging continuum.	aging	1996-04-??	Anatomical and physiological changes of the speech production mechanism that occur with aging may result in phonatory distinctions between older and younger speakers. This investigation examined amplitude-based glottal airflow characteristics from sustained vowel production in healthy adult women. Sixty women participated in this study, 10 each in six age groups of 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, and 70-year-olds. Measures included peak, alternating, and minimum glottal airflow. Additionally, a ratio of minimum to peak glottal airflow was calculated. Results from an analysis of variance indicated no significant group mean difference for any of the dependent measures. A greater variability in peak glottal airflow for the 70-year-old age group as compared to the 20-year-old age group was found. None of the dependent variables were significantly related to age and therefore were not good predictors of age. The results imply that laryngeal senescence in healthy women may not be significant enough…
146412	Relationship between tryptophan metabolism and vitamin B6 and nicotinamide in aged subjects.	aging	1975-??-??	The urinary excretion of tryptophan metabolites was studied in 20 aged subjects (over 70 years) after oral tryptophan loading (100 mg/kg body weight). All the subjects considered showed an abnormal excretion of metabolites with mean values of 24.67% in men and 25.83% in women in comparison to 6.77% in young controls. Among the metabolites the highest excretion was from kynurenine; moreover kynurenic acid and N-alpha-acetylkynurenine were also excreted in signficantly high amounts. The other metabolites too showed increased values. As the abnormal tryptophan metabolism in aging seemed to be in connection with vitamin B6 and nicotinamide, in a group of 7 aged sugjects the urinary excretion of tryptophan metabolites was studied after aminoacid loading with or without simultaneous administration of these two vitamins. The results show that the abnormal excretory pattern is normalized after vitamin administration (from 16.49% to 7.42% total mean metabolite values).
8203214	Effect of aging on smooth pursuit eye movement.	aging	1994-??-??	Examination of smooth pursuit eye movement is useful for detecting central nervous system disorders. It is important to take patient's age into consideration when evaluating smooth pursuit eye movement. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the effect of aging on smooth pursuit eye movement. Thirty healthy volunteers (three groups of 10 volunteers, in their fifties, sixties, and seventies and over, respectively) served as subjects, and 10 healthy young volunteers (23 to 33 years old: mean age 26) served as controls. The pursuit target was driven by sinusoidal waveform with various amplitudes and frequencies. Target peak velocities ranged from 12.6 to 94.2 degrees/s. Eye movement signals were recorded d.c. EOG and pursuit gain (ratio of eye peak velocity to target peak velocity) was measured by a computer. Pursuit gain decreased with increasing target frequency and velocity in all age groups. This tendency was more remarkable in the older groups than in the young controls; in …
1614643	Energy requirements in the elderly.	aging	1992-04-??	The major components of daily energy expenditure may change during aging. A review of current estimates of energy requirements leads to the conclusion that direct estimates of daily energy expenditure are desirable to confirm the validity of the present recommendations. A more extensive examination of the metabolic and nutritional significance of the major food fuel sources is necessary to further define human energy needs.
12742523	Proteomics in gerontological research.	aging	2003-05-??	The instrumental tools of proteomics offer great potential for molecular studies of biological aging. This article reviews specific applications and emerging concepts of proteomics, which are or can be applied to aging research.
7176658	Age-related changes of plasma steroids in normal adult males.	aging	1982-12-??	Plasma cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH-P), testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), were measured in 94 normal adult men aged between 20-99, using RIA methods after chromatographic separation of steroids on Sephadex LH-20 columns. All plasma steroids except 17-OH-P, were age dependent: cortisol, testosterone and DHT decreased significantly with age, whereas estrone and estradiol were significantly increased in elderly men. Cortisol, testosterone, T/DHT ratio and estradiol levels were significantly correlated with age. The age related changes of plasma steroids in elderly men, were suggestive of decreased cortisol secretion, and decreased testicular function with increased peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens. Testosterone was positively correlated with its precursor (17-OH-P) and respectively its peripheral metabolites (DHT and E2). The negative correlation between estrone and 17-OH-P found in elderly men, suggested that …
7696808	Age-related changes in proton T1 values of normal human brain.	aging	????-??-??	To determine whether there were age-related changes in the brain tissue of 55 healthy adult volunteers (29 men, 26 women; 18-72 years old) without known brain abnormalities, a standard inversion-recovery technique was optimized for precise and accurate T1 measurement within the constraints of a 15-minute examination. Measurements of water proton T1 were obtained in eight brain regions. T1 increased with age in the genu (P < .001) (analysis of variance), frontal white matter (P < .05), occipital white matter (P < .05), putamen (P < .001), and thalamus (P < .001). A significant decrease in T1 with age was found in cortical gray matter (P < .05). Thus, age-related changes in T1 are present in a healthy population, even if extremes of age are excluded, suggesting that T1 values generally increase with age. However, increases in T1 were also observed in the genu, putamen, and thalamus of a substantial fraction of volunteers less than 35 years old. Aging healthy persons can show subtle, nons…
14550396	The photosensitiser xanthurenic acid is not present in normal human lenses.	aging	2003-11-??	UV light has often been investigated as a risk factor for the most common cause of blindness, human age-related cataract. One mechanism whereby UV light could induce cataract is via the action of photosensitisers. In this regard, xanthurenic acid has recently been highlighted since it has been reported to be present in the human lens and, in model studies, it markedly enhances the photo-oxidation of proteins by wavelengths of light that penetrate the cornea. In this study we used HPLC and mass spectrometry to examine whether xanthurenic acid is indeed present in human lenses and, if so, the effect of age on its lenticular concentration. Xanthurenic acid could be formed artefactually by incubation of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OHKyn) yellow, a known autoxidation product of the lenticular UV filter, 3OHKyn, in the presence of air and light, however, it could not be detected in any human lenses studied. Therefore, it appears unlikely that xanthurenic acid plays a role in lens aging or human ca…
17077195	Age-related influence on thiol, disulfide, and protein-mixed disulfide levels in human plasma.	aging	2006-10-??	In this study, plasma levels of both low-molecular-mass sulfhydryls/disulfides and mixed disulfides with proteins in 41 healthy humans aged 21-92 years were measured, with the aim of assessing whether there is a shift of the thiol/disulfide balance during aging and verifying some of the possible effects of the thiol imbalance. Our data suggest that aging is strictly correlated to a decrease in plasma glutathione and cysteinylglycine with the concomitant increase of most oxidized forms of thiols and a parallel increase in total cysteine and total homocysteine, probably due to an augmented efflux of these amino acids from various organs. The occurrence of two distinct regulatory systems for plasmatic pools of glutathione/cysteinylglycine on the one hand and cysteine/homocysteine on the other hand is hypothesized.
1915676	Age-related cysteine uptake as rate-limiting in glutathione synthesis and glutathione half-life in the cultured human lens.	aging	1991-08-??	The study included human lenses of ages ranging from newborn to 92 years. Protein-free reduced glutathione decreased 14-fold, whereas protein-free oxidized glutathione increased 2.6-fold with increasing age. L-Cyst(e)ine uptake g-1 lens of very old cultured lenses decreased 70% from that exhibited in newborn lenses, demonstrating a marked decline of L-cyst(e)ine uptake as a function of age. In these same lenses the synthesis of reduced glutathione (mumol g-1 lens) decreased 73% with age. It was concluded that the glutathione decrease observed in the aging human lens was associated with decreased uptake of L-cyst(e)ine, decreased glutathione synthesis and possibly an increase in protein-free oxidized glutathione. The high correlation of L-cyst(e)ine uptake and glutathione synthesis supports the hypothesis that L-cyst(e)ine uptake is a rate-limiting factor of glutathione synthesis in the intact human lens. By the use of buthionine sulfoximine, the half-life of glutathione was estimated t…
10575292	A definite role for the kallikrein-kinin system in the renal hemodynamic response to an oral protein load during the aging process.	aging	1999-??-??	The effect of aging on the physiologic responses of renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate to an acute oral protein load (renal reserve) is a poorly understood process. In this study of 37 healthy human volunteers, distributed among three groups (group 1: n = 13, age range 20-39 years; group 2: n = 13, age range 40-59 years; group 3: n = 11, age range 60-68 years), we evaluated the influence of age on some of the vasoactive systems such as plasma renin activity, urinary kallikrein, plasmatic prokallikrein, plasmatic kallikrein, and plasmatic kininogen on RPF and creatinine clearance (Ccr) in response to an acute oral protein load (1 g/kg body weight). The aging process diminished but did not cease the increments in RPF (group 1: 539.6 vs. 658.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p < 0. 001; group 2: 509.0 vs. 570.7 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2), p < 0.001; group 3: 453.9 vs. 506.0 ml/min/ 1.73 m(2), p < 0.001) and Ccr (group 1: 139. 7 vs. 166.5 ml/ min/1.73 m(2), p < 0.001; group 2: 126.6 vs. 142.2…
1594891	Free plasma catecholamine levels in healthy subjects: a basal and dynamic study. The influence of age.	aging	1992-02-??	We studied the levels of free plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), adrenaline (epinephrine, E), and dopamine (DA) in 143 normal subjects, either basally or, in a part of them, in response to four tests stimulating the sympathoadrenomedullary activity: the tilt-table test (TTT), the cold-pressor test (CPT), the mental-arithmetic test (MAT), and the insulin tolerance test (ITT). In both cases we evaluated the influence of age, which is considered the main physiological variable affecting the peripheral sympathetic activity. A normal distribution of values was observed, in the basal study, only for NE, while E and particularly, DA levels were distributed in an non-homogeneous fashion; a direct correlation was observed between age of subjects and NE levels, while neither E, nor DA levels showed any correlation with the aging process; sex did not influence any of the catecholamines. In the dynamic study, CPT, ITT and, above all, TTT elicited a significant rise in NE levels, while the …
8017340	Bioavailability of vitamin B-6 in young and older men.	aging	1994-07-??	Various indexes of vitamin B-6 status have been shown to be reduced with aging. The cause for the apparent reduced vitamin B-6 status is not well understood. For direct assessment of how the bioavailability of vitamin B-6 is affected by aging, [2H]pyridoxine was orally administered to healthy men, aged 20-30 and 60-70 y, who were fed a controlled diet. No differences were observed in plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration, erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity, or plasma alkaline phosphatase activity between the two age groups. There were no age-related differences in the urinary excretion of total or [2H]4-pyridoxic acid during a 3-d collection period. Results from this study indicate that the bioavailability of vitamin B-6 is not altered with aging in free-living, healthy adult men.
15699522	Mapping development-related and age-related chromatin remodeling by a high throughput ChIP-HPLC approach.	aging	2004-12-??	Common to numerous differentiation pathways in vertebrate organisms is the regulation of key genes through epigenetic mechanisms. Less well studied is to what extent cells of a given differentiation state, but examined at different points within the life history of an organism, are distinct at the level of the epigenome. A few instances of such variation have been reported, and it would be of considerable value to have at hand a means to characterize additional examples more efficiently. We describe an integrated approach to this task, and further present evidence for regions of age-related histone H4 acetylation change extending over tens to hundreds of kilobases. Broad similarity between two distinct regions of such change suggests a previously unsuspected link between developmental programs and aging.
8268853	Glutathione levels of the human crystalline lens in aging and its antioxidant effect against the oxidation of lens proteins.	aging	1993-09-??	This paper reports the role of glutathione (GSH) in the crystalline lens as an antioxidant against the oxidation of lens protein. GSH levels in normal lenses decreased gradually with increasing age, from approximately 5 mumol per g lens (wet weight) to 3 mumol per g lens (wet weight). On the other hand, levels of oxidized GSH in the lenses increased until the age of 40. After that, it remained almost constant at the level of approximately 0.9 mumol per g lens. Protein-bound GSH levels in both soluble and insoluble lens proteins dropped noticeably in the 50-year and older age groups, although there were significant differences in levels between both fractions. A decrease of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in lens proteins was proportional to a decrease in GSH levels in the lens as a result of aging. Those residue levels in the cataractous lenses were approximately half those in the normal lens proteins, and GSH levels in such lenses were almost one-tenth that in the normal lens. This s…
11129399	The effect of gender and body composition method on the apparent decline in lean mass-adjusted resting metabolic rate with age.	aging	2000-12-??	BACKGROUND: Declining resting energy expenditure (REE) is a hallmark of normal aging, but the cause of this decline remains controversial. Some, but not all, studies have shown that the decline in REE with age is eliminated after adjustment for fat-free mass (FFM).    METHODS: We examined the effect of four body composition methods used to assess FFM (underwater weighing [UWW], bioimpedance analysis [BIA], tritium dilution, and total body potassium [TBK]) on the relationship between REE and age in 30 healthy men and 101 healthy women aged 18 to 87 years.    RESULTS: The decline in REE with age was significant in women (-80.3 kJ/d/y, p < .004) but not in men (-46.9 kJ/d/y, p = .328). After adjustment for FFM, the decline in REE with age persisted when FFM was measured by BIA, UWW, or tritium dilution, but no decline was seen when TBK was used to adjust for FFM. In both women and men, fat mass was significantly associated with REE after adjusting for age and FFM.    CONCLUSION: It is the…
11708216	Age-related de-phosphorylation of proteins in dentin: a biological tool for assessment of protein age.	aging	2000-??-??	Mature tooth dentin has essentially no metabolic activity, and thus post-translational modifications accumulate with aging in this tissue. In the present paper, we have studied age-related covalent changes of human dentin proteins. Dentin phosphorproteins (PP) were extracted and purified using ion exchange chromatography. Collagen was purified by CNBr cleavage and acetic acid extraction. The amino acid composition of the resultant protein preparations was determined by HPLC after post-column derivatization. Likewise the extent of aspartic acid (Asp) racemization was determined in total dentin, dentin collagen and PP. Collagen only displayed small, insignificant changes in amino acid composition and racemization with age. In contrast, PP exhibited significant age-related changes in amino acid composition, cross-linking and racemization. Thus the rate of Asp racemization in PP was 500-fold that found in collagen. Moreover, the phosphoserine (Ser(P)) content in human PP decreases dramatic…
12710740	Determination of hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids.	aging	????-??-??	Oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) plays a crucial role in inflammatorydiseases and aging. The main oxidation products of LDL are stereoisomeric 9-hydroxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acids (9-HODEs) and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acids (13-HODEs). Nevertheless the content of HODEs in natural oxidized LDL is low compared to other components, thus determination of HODEs requires a sample enrichment in most cases. Big losses are encountered during the necessary processing due to the instability of HODEs against acidic conditions. Therefore the use of labeled standards is required. Standards with an 18O label in the carboxylic group used previously may partly suffer a loss of the label by exchange with water. In this paper we describe an improved work-up procedure and the preparation of standards labeled with 18O in the hydroxylic group which is not exchangeable.
12112570	Age-related decrease in energy expenditure at rest parallels reductions in mass of internal organs.	aging	????-??-??	This study explores to what extent the mass of internal organs may impact the age-related decrease in energy expenditure at rest (EErest). The relationship between direct measurements of EErest in elderly women and predicted EErest based on equations deriving from the metabolic activity in tissue from younger women were also elucidated. Body composition of elderly women was measured by an impedance method. EErest was measured by the Douglas bag method after an overnight fast. These data were compared with predicted values of EErest based on equations derived from studies in younger women. The mass of internal organs was obtained from autopsy material. Young women (mean age 31.7 years, range 14-60, n = 104) and elderly women of 65 years (n = 22), 75 years (n = 26), and 85 years (n = 31) participated in this study. Autopsy data were obtained from women (n = 238) from the same birth cohorts as the elderly women who died at ages 42-87 years. EErest showed a progressive age-related decline,…
12674486	Metabolic aging and predicted longevity: results of a cross-sectional study in post-menopausal women.	longevity, aging	2002-12-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The extent to which general characteristics of metabolic aging contribute to differences in life span among individuals remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to examine the association of age-related physiological and metabolic variables with predicted longevity in postmenopausal women.    METHODS: Subjects were 33 healthy women aged 55-65 years. Total and resting energy expenditure, body temperature, immune function as assessed by a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test (DTH), lipid profile, and reported dietary intake were measured.    RESULTS: There were no significant associations between longevity, energy expenditure, body temperature, lipid profile, or dietary intake. However, there was a significant association of predicted longevity with DTH (partial r=0.44, p=0.023).    CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that immune function may predict familial differences in longevity, while energy expenditure, body temperature, lipid profile, and dietary …
8366264	Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of stimulated parotid salivary constituents in healthy, different-aged subjects.	aging	1993-09-??	BACKGROUND: Salivary gland dysfunction has traditionally been associated with old age, and complaints of xerostomia are common in an elderly population. Measurement of certain salivary constituents can provide information about the functional ability of discrete areas of the salivary gland. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to examine levels of salivary constituents in stimulated parotid saliva in a population of different-aged persons.    METHODS: The levels of five salivary constituents (total protein, lactoferrin, proline-rich proteins, sodium, and potassium) were measured in stimulated parotid saliva of 47 healthy, unmedicated men and women over a 10.5 year period.    RESULTS: There were no significant age-related decreases in the presence of total protein, lactoferrin, proline-rich proteins, sodium, and potassium in this exocrine secretion.    CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm and extend previous cross-sectional studies of salivary constituents, indicating that …
17559336	A model of metabolic changes in respiration-deficient human cells.	aging	2007-09-??	Cells lacking aerobic metabolism because of damaged mtDNA accumulate in many postmitotic tissues in the course aging. Although being only a small fraction of cells, they might play a major role in oxidative stress affecting the whole body. However, it remains unclear how such cells, which are under normal circumstances dependent on aerobic metabolism, are able to survive for decades in vivo. Here a new model is presented that proposes a coexistence of anaerobic glycolysis and a partly reversed TCA cycle. Succinate plays a key role in the changed metabolic pathways because it has to be exported by the cell. This hypothesis supports the view that some respiration-deficient cells are able to survive permanently within the body and contribute to human aging.
11542979	Cardiovascular reserve to orthostatic stress in active-living elders.	aging	1999-07-??	A preliminary field survey of cardiovascular responses during orthostatic stress in active-living very old elders over 70 years old in Japan was conducted. The subjects were 36 active-living elders (age; mean=77.8 yrs, 70-88 yrs) in rural Japan (mountain area), and 9 healthy young persons (mean 22 yrs). During short-term (2min) orthostatic stress, active-living elders (>70 years old) had age-dependent orthostatic tachycardia and hypertension (by increased pulse pressure), and significantly decreased heart rate fluctuations with maintained blood pressure fluctuations. We conclude that cardiovascular changes with aging itself do not necessarily cause orthostatic intolerance.
1884743	S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation in older Americans.	aging	1991-??-??	To examine whether a drug-metabolizing enzyme changes with normal aging, the S:R index of S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation was determined in 150, unmedicated elderly Americans (mean age 75.4). Ten (6.7%) were identified as categorically slow metabolizers (S:R ratios greater than or equal to .95). This increased incidence of slow metabolizers was accounted for by a significant and previously unreported, increased proportion of slow metabolizers among the black (18.5%) as compared to the white subjects (4.1%) (P = .017). There was no relationship found between S:R ratios and age or creatinine clearance.
17347754	Analysis of heart rate variability to predict patient age in a healthy population.	aging	2007-??-??	OBJECTIVES: To estimate age of healthy subjects by means of the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters thus assessing the potentiality of HRV indexes as a biomarker of age.    METHODS: Long-term indexes of HRV in time domain, frequency domain and non-linear parameters were computed on 24-hour recordings in a dataset of 63 healthy subjects (age range 20-76 years old). Then, as interbeat dynamics markedly change with age, showing a reduced HRV in older subjects, we tried to capture age-related influence on HRV by principal component analysis and to predict the subject age by means of a feedforward neural network.    RESULTS: The network provides good prediction of patient age, even if a slight overestimation in the younger subjects and a slight underestimation in the older ones were observed. In addition, the important contribution of non-linear indexes to prediction is underlined.    CONCLUSIONS: HRV as a predictor of age may lead to the definition of a new biomarker of aging.
2470251	Age and sex-dependent changes in serum amylase in an apparently healthy population.	aging	1989-05-??	In order to determine whether changes in serum amylase are age- or sex-dependent, we evaluated age- and sex-stratified serum amylase values in subjects who were proven to be healthy by a precise preventive health examination. Results showed that serum amylase increased as age progressed, except in the 0- to 29-yr-old female group. Mean serum amylase was higher in females than in males. A previous study indicated that the etiology of the increase in amylase in elderly persons is due to a progressive decline in renal function with aging. The etiology of the sex difference, especially in the younger generation, requires further investigation. We should pay attention to the factor of age when we evaluate serum amylase.
3999813	Decreased protein synthesis of transforming lymphocytes from aged humans: relationship to impaired mitogenesis with age.	aging	1985-04-??	Recent studies have indicated that the decline in mitogenesis during the aging process may be related to intracellular defects that become apparent when the cells are subjected to the metabolic stress of cell transformation. We provide the first report of an age-related decline in protein synthesis in human lymphocytes exposed to phytohemagglutinin. This impairment in protein synthetic capacity from aged subjects' transforming cells is apparent from 24 to 72 h of culture. By 72 h of culture the incorporation of radiolabeled leucine in stimulated cells from elderly subjects is about half that for the young. However, cells from the aged have an increased protein content in the face of decreased synthesis suggesting a degradation defect. Since protein synthesis may be necessary for the induction of key effectors which activate glycolysis (which is necessary for transformation), we sought to relate the impaired protein synthesis to the impaired glycolytic enzyme induction with age. Cyclohe…
7233485	Procainamide interference with liquid chromatography of theophylline in serum.	aging	1981-??-??	We described potential interference of procainamide with our high pressure liquid chromatography procedure for assaying theophylline (similar to that given by Orcutt et al.). In participating in the AACC-TDM quality-control program, we discovered procainamide interference on a column dedicated to theophylline and acetaminophen serum analyses. Following attempts at rejuvenation, this 7-month-old column was replaced with a new one, which gave base-line separation of theophylline and procainamide with no difficulty. We recommend close attention to the aging characteristics of columns and participation in a quality-control program.
1355868	Age-related decline of cerebral oxygen metabolism in normal population detected with positron emission tomography.	aging	1992-??-??	Using positron emission tomography (PET), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were measured in 32 healthy volunteers aged from 27 to 67 years. In bilateral putamen, left supratemporal, left infrafrontal and left parietal cortices, CMRO2 showed a significant decline during aging. The age-related decline of CBF was seen only at the left superior temporal cortex. The mean CMRO2 was significantly lower in the elder group (over 51 years old) than in the younger group (under 50 years old), whereas no significant difference in mean CBF between the two groups. The poor correlation of CBF to the age could be explained partly by the fact that CBF is easily influenced by the physiological, psychological and/or environmental factors. The age-related changes of CMRO2 were more marked in the association cortices of the left hemisphere than in that of the right hemisphere.
8413942	Neurologic function in the optimally healthy oldest old. Neuropsychological evaluation.	aging	1993-10-??	We examined cognition on a wide range of standardized neuropsychological tests in two groups of optimally healthy, elderly volunteers. One was composed of community-dwelling, functionally independent individuals aged 84 years and older, and the other group was nearly 20 years younger. The effect of aging was greatest on visual perceptual and constructional tasks rather than on memory tasks. Many cognitive functions were relatively well preserved in the optimally healthy oldest old.
11269380	Detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations in human gingival tissues.	aging	2000-12-??	The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutation is an important contributor to the aging process. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out on total DNA from gingival tissues of human subjects with ages of 19 to 64 years, and 5.0-kb and 7.4-kb deletions were found in the mitochondrial genomes of these subjects. This is the first report of mitochondrial DNA deletion detectable in human gingival tissues.
6169093	High performance liquid chromatography of hemoglobins: factors affecting resolution.	aging	1981-??-??	We have investigated the effect of various factors on resolution of hemoglobin mixtures by ion exchange HPLC. Small changes in the pH of start buffer had a considerable effect on the ability to separate HBs A2 and S. Complete separation of Hbs A2, S, A, Hb A1 fraction and Hb F required 30 min. gradient elution programs. Aging of the hemolysate obscured the presence of small amounts of Hb F. Deterioration in column performance was attributed to dissolution of some of the column packing material as well as irreversible binding of hemoglobin component(s) to the ion exchanger. Substantial differences in elution time were observed between different columns requiring modifications in the gradient programs with some columns. The resolution achieved makes the HPLC technique a powerful new tool for hemoglobin analysis.
20469802	Sociodemographic and health correlates of sleep quality and duration among very old Chinese.	longevity	2010-05-??	STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine factors associated with self-reported sleep quality and duration among very old adults in China.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2005 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS).    SETTING: In-home interview with older adults in 22 provinces in mainland China.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 15,638 individuals aged 65 and older (5,047 aged 65-79, 3870 aged 80-89, 3927 aged 90-99, and 2794 aged 100 and older, including 6688 men and 8950 women).    INTERVENTIONS: N/A.    MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two self-reported sleep questions together with numerous sociodemographic and health status measures were used in this study. Sixty-five per cent of Chinese elders reported good quality of sleep. The average number of self-reported hours of sleep was 7.5 (SD 1.9), with 13.1%, 16.2%, 18.0%, 28.0%, 9.2%, and 15.5% reporting < or = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and > or =10 hours, respectively (weighted). Multivariate analyses showed that male gender, rur…
25128876	Identification and quantification of antitumor thioproline and methylthioproline in Korean traditional foods by a liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.	aging	2014-11-??	A liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometric method (LC-APCI-MS/MS) has been developed for the sensitive determination of antitumor thioproline and methylthioproline from fermented foods. Thioproline and methylthioproline were derivatized in one step with ethyl chloroformate at room temperature. These compounds were identified and quantified in various traditional Korean fermented foods by LC-APCI-MS/MS. The concentration range of thioproline of each food was found for doenjang (0.011-0.032mg/kg), gochujang (0.010-0.038mg/kg), and ganjang (0.010-0.038mg/kg). Those of methylthioproline of each food was found for doenjang (0.098-0.632mg/kg), gochujang (0.015-0.112mg/kg), and ganjang (0.023-1.468mg/kg). A prolonged aging time leads to an increase in both the thioproline and methylthioproline contents, suggesting that the storage time plays a key role in the formation of thioproline and methylthioproline in Korean traditional foods. The results…
7547654	Aging reduces the reliability of epidural epinephrine test doses.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The authors recently determined that intravascular injection of an epinephrine test dose reliably produced an increase in heart rate > or = 20 beats/min in young individuals. However, aging is associated with a significant reduction in beta-adrenergic responsiveness. This study was designed to determine whether aging decreases the magnitude of heart rate (HR) increase after intravascular injection of epinephrine.    METHODS: Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded during randomized and double-blind injections of 3 mL lidocaine plain or lidocaine with 10 or 15 micrograms epinephrine in 30 elective surgical patients between 21 and 81 years old.    RESULTS: Increasing age was associated with smaller increases in HR after intravascular injection of epinephrine. The reduction in HR increase was statistically significant after 10 micrograms (P = .006, r2 = .24), but not after 15 micrograms (P = .25, r2 = .05) of epinephrine. Heart rate increases were o…
10846632	Basal metabolic rate and body composition in elderly Indian males.	aging	2000-04-??	Aging is associated with a decline in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total energy expenditure. The extent to which changes in fat free mass (FFM) alone, explains the reduction in BMR is still unresolved. In this study, we documented changes in body composition and evaluated its contribution to measured BMR in young and elderly Indian subjects. We compared 16 healthy elderly male subjects in the age group of 60-75 years with 16 Body Mass Index (kg/m2) matched controls in the age group of 18-25 years. Body composition measurements were determined by using multiple skinfolds and bio-impedence method. BMR measured by indirect calorimetry. The % fat and fat free mass was significantly different between two groups. There were significant difference in BMR between elderly and control group (elderly, 5.91 +/- 0.54 vs control; 7.08 +/- 0.65 MJ/day, P < 0.001), which disappeared when corrected for FFM. This suggests that the age related decrease in the BMR is related to the absolute decrease in …
12462729	Optical measurement of human retinal macular pigment and its spatial distribution with age.	aging	2002-11-??	The existence of macular pigment (MP) in human eyes has been found to be of importance in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). A noninvasive technique of two-wavelength imaging fundus reflectometry was developed to measure the density distribution of this yellow pigment in retina in vivo. A total of 55 healthy human subjects were recruited and divided into three groups with average ages and sample sizes of 25.2+/-2.1 (N = 25), 40.2+/-8.3 (N = 13), and 67.5+/-7.1 years (N = 17), respectively. Only the MP distributions in the horizontal meridian of retinas are presented in this report. The results show that the average peak optical density of MP are 0.23+/-0.07, 0.21+/-0.05, and 0.25+/-0.06 from young to old groups, respectively. No significant difference is shown in the statistical t-test between the groups of the peak MP density. The half width of MP spatial distribution (HWMPD) are 4.8 degrees+/-1.5 degrees, 5.1 degrees+/-2.1 degrees and 7.7 degrees+/-2.0 degrees…
21324569	Body composition changes over 9 years in healthy elderly subjects and impact of physical activity.	aging	2011-08-??	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Age-related changes of body composition affect health status. This study aims at clarifying body composition changes in healthy elderly subjects, and evaluating the impact of physical activity on these changes.    METHODS: In 1999, 213 subjects ≥ 65 years recruited through advertisements underwent assessment of health state, energy expenditure by physical activity, body composition by bioimpedance analysis and body cell mass by total body potassium. In 2008, 112 of them repeated these assessments with additional determination of Barthel index, Mini Mental State Examination and Geriatric Depression Score.    RESULTS: Lean tissues decreased in both genders (p < 0.05). Compared to subjects aged 65-74 years at baseline, those aged ≥75 years lost more body weight (men: -3.7 ± 5.4 vs. 0.4 ± 5.4 kg, women: -3.6 ± 5.5 vs. 0.3 ± 5.2 kg, both p < 0.05), and fat-free mass (men: -3.6 ± 3.3 vs. -0.4 ± 2.7 kg, women: -1.8 ± 2.3 vs. -0.1 ± 2.5 kg, both p < 0.05). Plotting of fat-fr…
12240740	Noun and verb retrieval in healthy aging.	aging	2002-09-??	This study tests the hypothesis that retrieval of object and action names declines at different rates with age. Uncued and cued performance on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Action Naming Test (ANT) were examined for 171 individuals from 50 to 88 years old. To control for differences in item difficulty, a subset of items from each of the two tests was selected for which uncued performance was equivalent in individuals in their 50s. With this matched set of items, differences in action and object naming were tested in the 60s and 70+ age groups. Although age-related decline in name retrieval was observed for both the BNT and the ANT subsets, no differences between object and action retrieval were found. Our results, thus, do not confirm previous studies reporting that object names and action names are differentially retrieved with aging. We discuss these new findings in relation to evidence of dissociations in object and action naming in brain-damaged individuals.
25476566	fMRI subsequent source memory effects in young, middle-aged and old adults.	lifespan, aging	2015-03-01	The ability to remember the spatial context in which our experiences occur declines linearly across the adult lifespan. However, little is known about whether this source memory decline is associated with neural activity changes. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were recorded in young, middle-aged and old adults to investigate brain activity variations across the adult lifespan during encoding of subsequent spatial source memory retrieval. Twelve healthy individuals of both sexes were enrolled in each age group. During encoding, participants performed natural/artificial judgment of images of common objects that were randomly presented in one of the quadrants of the screen. During retrieval, the images presented at encoding were randomly mixed with new ones and displayed at the center of the screen. Participants judged whether each image was new or old and, if an image was old, they were instructed to indicate in which quadrant the image was prese…

26028054	Promoting theory of mind in older adults: does age play a role?	aging	2016-??-??	OBJECTIVES: Previous research on age-related changes in Theory of Mind (ToM) showed a decline in older adults, particularly pronounced over 75 years of age. Evidence that ToM may be enhanced in healthy aging people has been demonstrated, but no study has focused on the role of age on the effects of ToM training for elderly people. The present study was designed to examine the efficacy of a ToM training on practiced (ToM Strange Stories) and transfer tasks (ToM Animations) in both young and older adults.    METHOD: The study involved 127 older adults belonging to two age groups: young-old (Mage = 64.41; SD = 2.49; range: 60-69 years) and old-old (Mage = 75.66; SD = 4.38; range: 70-85 years), randomly assigned to either a ToM group or a control group condition. All participants took part in two 2-hour testing sessions and four 2-hour training sessions.    RESULTS: Results showed that both young-old and old-old adults in the ToM group condition improved their ability to reason on complex-…
24466165	Effects of extrinsic mortality on the evolution of aging: a stochastic modeling approach.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2014-??-??	The evolutionary theories of aging are useful for gaining insights into the complex mechanisms underlying senescence. Classical theories argue that high levels of extrinsic mortality should select for the evolution of shorter lifespans and earlier peak fertility. Non-classical theories, in contrast, posit that an increase in extrinsic mortality could select for the evolution of longer lifespans. Although numerous studies support the classical paradigm, recent data challenge classical predictions, finding that high extrinsic mortality can select for the evolution of longer lifespans. To further elucidate the role of extrinsic mortality in the evolution of aging, we implemented a stochastic, agent-based, computational model. We used a simulated annealing optimization approach to predict which model parameters predispose populations to evolve longer or shorter lifespans in response to increased levels of predation. We report that longer lifespans evolved in the presence of rising predatio…
22984797	Mediating effects of processing speed and executive functions in age-related differences in episodic memory performance: a cross-validation study.	aging	2012-11-??	OBJECTIVE: Age differences in episodic memory (memory) have been attributed to a general reduction in processing speed (the "speed mediation hypothesis"), but also to declines in the efficiency of executive functions operations ("executive decline hypothesis"). To test predictions from these competing models, we examined the mediating effects of processing speed (speed) and executive functions (executive) on age and episodic memory in three older adult cohorts.    METHOD: The first sample comprised 842 individuals from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS). The second and third samples included 476 individuals from the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS), with each twin from a pair randomly assigned to form two samples. A series of regression analyses was performed on each of the three samples independently, so as to obtain the sizes and statistical significances of the indirect effects of age on each of the memory variables, mediated by each of the Executive and Speed composites. Se…
10573445	The power of ageism on physical function of older persons: reversibility of age-related gait changes.	aging	1999-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that age-associated changes in physical function, particularly walking performance, are influenced by ageism and that the activation of positive sterotypes of aging can partially reverse these changes.    DESIGN: Randomized intervention study.    SETTING: General community.    PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven community-dwelling men and women (63-82 years old) who walked independently and described themselves as healthy.    INTERVENTION: Thirty-minute exposure to the subconscious reinforcement of either a positive or negative stereotype of aging while subjects played a computer game.    MEASUREMENTS: Pre- and postintervention measures of gait speed and percent swing time (the time spent with one foot in the air during walking). Health and psychosocial status were also evaluated.    RESULTS: Significant increases in walking speed (9%+/-2%; P < .001) and percent swing time (percent change: 1.1%+/-0.4%; P = .023) were observed in subjects who received reinforceme…
18821446	Doing everyday life--experiences of the oldest old.	aging	2009-05-??	The purpose of this article is to explore how a group of elderly people, living and managing on their own, describe and experience their everyday doings. Interviews and observations were conducted with 18 community-living people aged 85 and above. The experiences of 'Doing everyday life' are described in five overarching themes: 'Experiencing being old', 'Doings in everyday life', 'Patterns of the day', 'Altered doings', and 'The importance of time'. What is done during an ordinary day does not differ much from earlier in life, but how the doings are performed has changed. Being occupied and staying healthy and sound in mind was stressed as important in old age and even if reduced energy and functional constraints limited the doings, a strong volition to manage independently was expressed. The participants perceived society as regarding the elderly as useless and worthless. Knowledge emanating from the very old themselves is vital to diversify the image of elderly people and to offer i…
25645586	Aberrant post-translational modifications compromise human myosin motor function in old age.	aging	2015-04-??	Novel experimental methods, including a modified single fiber in vitro motility assay, X-ray diffraction experiments, and mass spectrometry analyses, have been performed to unravel the molecular events underlying the aging-related impairment in human skeletal muscle function at the motor protein level. The effects of old age on the function of specific myosin isoforms extracted from single human muscle fiber segments, demonstrated a significant slowing of motility speed (P < 0.001) in old age in both type I and IIa myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. The force-generating capacity of the type I and IIa MyHC isoforms was, on the other hand, not affected by old age. Similar effects were also observed when the myosin molecules extracted from muscle fibers were exposed to oxidative stress. X-ray diffraction experiments did not show any myofilament lattice spacing changes, but unraveled a more disordered filament organization in old age as shown by the greater widths of the 1, 0 equatorial r…
19957265	Circadian variation in salivary testosterone across age classes in Ache Amerindian males of Paraguay.	aging	????-??-??	Testosterone levels exhibit a circadian rhythm in healthy men, with morning levels tending to be higher compared to evening titers. However, circadian rhythms wane with age. Although this has been described in males living within industrialized settings, age-related changes have not received similar attention in populations outside these contexts. Because many nonindustrialized populations, such as Ache Amerindians of Paraguay, exhibit testosterone levels that are lower than what is commonly reported in the clinical literature and lack age-associated variation in testosterone, it was hypothesized that Ache men would not show age-related variation in testosterone circadian rhythms. Diurnal rhythmicity in testosterone within and between Ache men in association with age (n = 52; age range, 18-64) was therefore examined. A significant negative association was evident between the ratio of morning and evening salivary testosterone and age (r = -0.28, P = 0.04). Men in their third decade of l…
11129397	A 15-year longitudinal follow-up study of heart rate and heart rate variability in healthy elderly persons.	aging	2000-12-??	BACKGROUND: Few researchers have conducted heart rate (HR) studies in healthy very elderly subjects aged 70 years or older, and there are no longitudinal follow-up studies in this population. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term changes in HR and heart rate variability (HRV) with aging in healthy elderly persons by means of comparison between two Holter monitor recordings obtained at an interval of 15 years.    METHODS: The study population consisted of 15 healthy elderly persons (10 women and 5 men) aged 64 to 80 years (mean 70 +/- 4.1) at the first recording, and 79 to 95 years old (mean 85 +/- 4.1 years) at the second recording 15 years later. Nighttime (midnight to 5 AM) and daytime (noon to 5 PM) HR and HRV were obtained, and paired t tests were performed to assess the differences in each parameter of nighttime and daytime HR and HRV between the two (15-year interval) Holter monitor recordings.    RESULTS: The results of the t-test comparisons were as follows: the…
18215483	Nonenzymatic posttranslational protein modifications in ageing.	aging	2008-04-??	One of the most fundamental molecular aspects of aging is accumulating oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as proposed by the free radical theory of aging. These unwanted chemical side products of normal metabolism lead to the formation of altered, less active and potentially toxic species of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and small molecules. Due to gradually accumulating small contributions of irreversible reactions during ageing, uncatalyzed chemical side reactions occur with increasing frequencies and repair functions decline. Eventually key biochemical pathways are impaired by increasingly less efficient cellular stress management. In this review, we describe the chemical nature of nonenzymatic age-related modifications of proteins and provide an overview of related analytical challenges and approaches, with a focus on mass spectrometry. We include the description of a strategy to rapidly exploit the wealth of mass spectrometric information from standard MALDI-TO…
8472366	Effects of age, race, sex, and smoking on prothrombin fragment 1.2 in a healthy population.	aging	1993-04-??	Prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2) is a biomarker of thrombin generation during blood coagulation and has diagnostic potential for assessing thrombotic risk and monitoring anticoagulation therapy. We used a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for plasma F1.2 to establish a well-defined reference interval and to evaluate the effects of age, race, sex, and smoking status on F1.2 concentrations in a healthy population. Plasma samples and demographic information were obtained from 357 healthy individuals. F1.2 concentrations more closely followed a lognormal than a gaussian frequency distribution. In a multiple linear-regression model in which the logarithms of F1.2 concentrations were regressed on age, race, sex, and smoking status, the significant explanatory variables were age and, to a lesser extent, sex and smoking. A segmented "hockey stick" regression model indicated that F1.2 concentrations and age were unrelated for individuals < 44 years old but were positively correlated above th…
12099486	Age-related differences in the medial temporal lobe responses to emotional faces as revealed by fMRI.	aging	2002-??-??	Age-related differences involved in the neural substrates of emotional face perception were investigated in young and old healthy volunteers. The subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they were judging the gender of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotional valence. The results showed that both the predominant activation in young subjects and reduced activity in old subjects contributed to a significant age difference in the left amygdala during the perception of negative faces. Activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus during the perception of positive faces diminished with advancing age. Neural activity in the angular gyrus and lingual gyrus of the right hemisphere was reduced in the old subjects during the perception of positive faces. There was no region where old subjects had greater activity than young subjects during the task. In old subjects, the overall activity in the right hippocampus during the task correlated negatively with ag…
11557284	Succinic dehydrogenase activity in human muscle mitochondria during aging: a quantitative cytochemical investigation.	aging	2001-10-??	A quantitative cytochemical study has been carried out on succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in biopsy samples of vastus lateralis (VL) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles from healthy men undergoing orthopaedic surgery. According to their age, the patients were divided into: young (25.0+/-4.4 years), middle-aged (50.4+/-7.5 years) and old (75.5+/-3.9 years) groups. Bioptically excised samples were processed for copper ferrocyanide preferential SDH cytochemistry. By a computer-assisted image analyser, we calculated the ratio (R): overall area of the precipitates due to the enzyme activity/area of each mitochondrion. No significant difference was found among the three age groups, despite an 8% increase of R in the adult vs. the other groups. R values are related to mitochondrial morphofunctional features since they may be modulated by enzyme activity and the physico-chemical conditions of the organelle membranes. Thus, R quantitation enables to estimate the mitochondrial capacities fo…
7492978	Evidence for accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides during the aging of human red blood cells in the circulation.	aging	1995-05-??	Young and old human red blood cells (RBC) were separated from freshly collected human blood by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The amounts of lipid peroxidation products in the lipid fractions of these RBC were determined by high performance liquid chromatography-chemiluminescence, thiobarbituric acid and LPO-586 methods. The levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine hydroperoxides in old RBC were higher than in young RBC. The products reflecting the advanced stage of lipid peroxidation, malonaldehyde (free and bound forms), 4-hydroxyalkenals (free and bound forms) and other aldehydes, were also higher in old RBC than in young RBC. The levels of these lipid peroxidation products increased when whole RBC were mildly oxidized with ferric ion. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBC in the circulation takes place during the aging process, and lipid hydroperoxides and other lipid peroxidation products accumulate in old RBC.
24655681	Future talk in later life.	aging	2014-04-??	This article focuses on the relevance that the dimension of the future has for promoting healthy and active aging. Older people generally have difficulties in talking about the future and when they do they generally express very negative perspectives on it. The data analyzed in this paper are part of an on-going interdisciplinary research project: "Aging, poverty and social exclusion: an interdisciplinary study on innovative support services" (https://apseclunl.wordpress.com/). The project aims at documenting good practices in social intervention with older people who are at risk of exclusion. This study describes and critically discusses an activity carried out in Portugal among older women in a poor area in the suburb of Lisbon entitled "self-awareness workshop on the future". Through a detailed discourse analysis within an ethnomethodological framework the study shows age membership categorizations in use and categorization processes, examining the workshop interaction. In particula…
11772534	Nonagenarians from the Swedish NONA Immune Study have increased plasma antioxidant capacity and similar levels of DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to younger control subjects.	longevity	????-??-??	The results of previous work from our laboratories have suggested that free radical damage to T cells as they age may contribute to the age-related decline in the T cell-mediated immune response. The aims of this investigation were to assess the efficiency of in vivo antioxidant capacity through determining the antioxidant capacity of plasma using the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, and to assess the levels and types of DNA damage (as a measure of in vivo antioxidant efficiency) using the alkaline comet assay and two enzymatic modifications of the comet assay, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from nonagenarian subjects drawn from the Swedish NONA Immune Study. The results obtained were compared with those from middle-aged (40-60 years) controls to identify potential anti-immunosenescent effects of in vivo antioxidants. The results revealed a significantly higher plasma antioxidant capacity in NONA subjects compared to controls, and these results support a relation…
16567382	Functional status of centenarians in Tokyo, Japan: developing better phenotypes of exceptional longevity.	longevity, aging	2006-03-??	BACKGROUND: Centenarians are sometimes said to be representative of lifelong healthy aging. Whether they are, in fact, examples of healthy aging remains a subject of debate. The existence of heterogeneity in functional status has been reported repeatedly in previous studies of centenarians. However, there is as yet no standardized classification system with which to describe their functional phenotype.    METHODS: As part of a dynamic cohort study, we studied 304 centenarians (65 men and 239 women) living in Tokyo. Their functional status (sensory, physical, and cognitive), which we used to represent their phenotype, was assessed and subsequently classified by standard assessment methods (simple questionnaire, Barthel index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Clinical Dementia Rating, respectively).    RESULTS: We classified participants into 4 categories according to their functional status. Only 5 (2%) were classified as "Exceptional," with all of their functions graded as excell…
10451025	Physiological levels of melatonin contribute to the antioxidant capacity of human serum.	aging	1999-08-??	This work evaluates whether physiological concentrations of the pineal secretory product melatonin contribute to the total antioxidant status (TAS) of human serum. Day and nighttime serum samples were collected from healthy volunteers ranging from 2 to 89 years of age and used to measure melatonin and TAS. Results showed that both melatonin and TAS in human serum exhibited 24 hr variations with nocturnal peak values at 01:00 hr. Moreover, exposure of volunteers to light at night resulted in clear decreases of both TAS and melatonin. Furthermore, when melatonin was removed from sera collected at night, the TAS value of the sample was reduced to basal daytime values. In aging studies, it was found that nocturnal serum values of TAS and melatonin exhibited maximal values during the first four decades; thereafter, these values decreased as age advanced. In 60-year-old individuals, day/night differences in serum melatonin and TAS levels were clearly diminished, by more than 80%, with these …
22950434	Spermidine and spermine are enriched in whole blood of nona/centenarians.	longevity, aging	2012-12-??	Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are a family of molecules that derive from ornithine through a decarboxylation process. They are essential for cell growth and proliferation, stabilization of negative charges of DNA, RNA transcription, translation, and apoptosis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that exogenously administered spermidine promotes longevity in yeasts, flies, worms, and human cultured immune cells. Here, using a cross-sectional observational study, we determined whole-blood polyamines levels from 78 sex-matched unrelated individuals divided into three age groups: Group 1 (31-56 years, n=26, mean age 44.6±6.07), group 2 (60-80 years, n=26, mean age 68.7±6.07), and group 3 (90-106 years, n=26, mean age 96.5±4.59). The total content of polyamines is significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (p=3.6×10(-12)). Interestingly, this reduction is mainly attributable to the lower putrescine content. Group 2 displays the lowest levels of spermidine a…
24517174	Age-dependent changes in stratum corneum barrier function.	aging	2014-11-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The Stratum Corneum (SC) barrier function mainly depends on the SC structure at the tissue level, its composition, and the organization of intercellular lipidic cement at the molecular level. The goal of this study was to assess the age-dependent changes of the SC barrier function and the associated physiological parameters.    METHODS: This study was conducted on 40 French women divided into four groups of age. Measurements were done on three sites: cheek, protected, and exposed arm sites. SC composition (water, lipid/protein ratio, cholesterol, and ceramides) was measured using Raman confocal microspectroscopy, skin surface hydration using skin conductance, and barrier function through transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements.    RESULTS: Transepidermal water loss decreases slightly with age, which is partially explained by the age-dependent increase in SC thickness. This decrease is faster for the face compared to both arm sites. The lipid to protein ratio a…
2936607	Physical health correlates of attitudes toward aging in the elderly.	aging	1985-??-??	Attitudes toward aging were assessed in three groups of elderly men (age 65-85), including: hospitalized veterans, veteran outpatients, and a group of non-hospitalized "healthy" veteran volunteers, using the Rosencranz and McNevin Semantic Differential Scale. Social objects rated included an "old man", a "young man", and the participant, himself, ("self"). Attitudes toward "old men" were significantly more negative than attitudes toward "young men" in all three groups. In addition, significant group by "object-rated" interactions were obtained on the autonomous/dependent and instrumental/ineffective dimensions of this scale. These interactions were attributable to a more negative "self" rating by the hospitalized group. These results suggest that within the population studied, older persons in poor health tend to view themselves more like the stereotyped "old person" than do healthy old people, who tend to perceive themselves as being more like a "young person".
23343484	Cognitive performance of individuals with schizophrenia across seven decades: a study using the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery.	aging	2013-02-??	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of aging, schizophrenia, and their interaction on cognitive function.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional controlled study.    SETTING: Community living.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 235 subjects with schizophrenia age 19-79 and 333 comparison subjects age 20-81.    MEASUREMENTS: The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).    RESULTS: Older age was associated with poorer performance on 9 of 10 MCCB tests in both subjects with schizophrenia and comparison subjects. Subjects with schizophrenia were impaired relative to comparison subjects on each of the 10 tests. However, there was no interaction between aging and schizophrenia on any test. Essentially the same results were observed when analyzing performance on the seven MCCB cognitive domains and MCCB global composite score.    CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other reports, schizophrenia appears to be …
15175090	Stimulus-induced brain lactate: effects of aging and prolonged wakefulness.	aging	2004-06-??	Both aging and sleep deprivation disturb the functions of the frontal lobes. Deficits in brain energy metabolism have been reported in these conditions. Neurons use not only glucose but also lactate as their energy substrate. The physiological response to elevated neuronal activity is a transient increase in lactate concentrations in the stimulated area. We have previously shown that cognitive stimulation increases brain lactate. To study the effect of prolonged wakefulness on the lactate response we designed an experiment to assess brain lactate levels during a 40-h sleep deprivation period in young (19-24 years old; n = 13) and in aged (60-68 years old; n = 12) healthy female volunteers. Brain lactate levels were assessed with proton MR-spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) during the performance of a silent word generation task. The (1)H MRS voxel location was individually selected, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, to cover the activated area in the left frontal lobe. The degree of sl…
20433617	Personality and health, subjective well-being, and longevity.	longevity, aging	2010-02-??	Personality traits can be employed to guide understanding of trajectories to health and longevity, but long-term longitudinal study and multifaceted assessment of healthy aging are crucial. Following up on the life span study initiated by Lewis Terman, we assessed 4 validated factors of personality in young adulthood in 1940, constructed a multifactor measure of participants' healthy aging in 1986, and collected death certificates through 2007 (to determine longevity) on a sample of 1,312 Terman participants (732 men). Neuroticism predicted worse physical health and subjective well-being in old age and, for women, higher mortality risk, but for men, neuroticism predicted decreased mortality risk. For both sexes, extraversion predicted old-age social competence, whereas conscientiousness predicted men's old-age productivity. Differential patterns of association between personality traits and healthy aging components are informative about individual personality characteristics and long-t…
3782425	Decreased bioavailable testosterone in aging normal and impotent men.	aging	1986-12-??	Tissue available (bioavailable) testosterone (T) includes circulating free T (FT) and albumin-bound T. A reasonable assessment of bioavailable T can be made by using 50% ammonium sulfate to precipitate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound T. The supernatant non-SHBG-bound T (non-SHBG-T) correlates well with physiological androgen activity. To assess bioavailable T in normal aging men, we analyzed serum samples from seven healthy aged men (65-83 yr old) and compared the results to samples from 13 young men (22-39 yr old). Mean serum T, FT, and LH concentrations were not significantly different in the 2 groups. However, the mean absolute non-SHBG-T level was significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in the older group. In a separate population of 20 impotent but otherwise healthy men (5 27-37 yr old, 10 48-64 yr old, and 5 66-69 yr old), the mean absolute non-SHBG-T concentration was lower in middle-aged (P less than .01) and elderly men (P less than 0.001) than in young men. The abso…
25528930	Biological psychological and social determinants of old age: bio-psycho-social aspects of human aging.	aging	2014-??-??	The aging of humans is a physiological and dynamic process ongoing with time. In accordance with most gerontologists' assertions it starts in the fourth decade of life and leads to death. The process of human aging is complex and individualized, occurs in the biological, psychological and social sphere. Biological aging is characterized by progressive age-changes in metabolism and physicochemical properties of cells, leading to impaired self-regulation, regeneration, and to structural changes and functional tissues and organs. It is a natural and irreversible process which can run as successful aging, typical or pathological. Biological changes that occur with age in the human body affect mood, attitude to the environment, physical condition and social activity, and designate the place of seniors in the family and society. Psychical ageing refers to human awareness and his adaptability to the ageing process. Among adaptation attitudes we can differentiate: constructive, dependence, hos…
18465743	Effects of aging on cerebral blood flow, oxygen metabolism, and blood oxygenation level dependent responses to visual stimulation.	aging	2009-04-??	Calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a noninvasive technique to assess functional metabolic changes associated with normal aging. We simultaneously measured both the magnitude of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses in the visual cortex for separate conditions of mild hypercapnia (5% CO(2)) and a simple checkerboard stimulus in healthy younger (n = 10, mean: 28-years-old) and older (n = 10, mean: 53-years-old) adults. From these data we derived baseline CBF, the BOLD scaling parameter M, the fractional change in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)) with activation, and the coupling ratio n of the fractional changes in CBF and CMRO(2). For the functional activation paradigm, the magnitude of the BOLD response was significantly lower for the older group (0.57 +/- 0.07%) compared to the younger group (0.95 +/- 0.14%), despite the finding that the fractional CBF and CMRO(2) changes were simil…
3127454	Thyroid hormone indices in adult healthy subjects: no influence of aging.	aging	1988-04-??	Controversy exists regarding the influence of aging on thyroid hormone metabolism. Several investigators report lowering of T3 and/or a rise in reverse T3 (rT3) in elderly subjects. Others suggest that these thyroid hormone alterations were secondary to associated disorders rather than old age, and questioned the "healthy" status of the subjects studied in the earlier reports. Therefore, to assess the possible effect of aging we studied T3 resin uptake, T4, free T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations in 152 euthyroid healthy adult subjects. These subjects were selected carefully and were therefore devoid of any illness, acute or chronic, and were not treated with any medications at the time of study. No significant alterations were noted in any of the thyroid hormone concentrations in subjects divided into groups according to age. Nor was there a significant difference in these parameters between men and women of any individual age group or for all ages combined. Therefore, old age per se may …
2382714	Effect of age on body composition and resting metabolic rate.	aging	1990-08-??	The relationship between fat-free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) was compared in young men (n = 24; age 18-33 yr), old men (n = 24; 69-89 yr), and old women (n = 20; 67-75 yr). Body composition was assessed using anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and isotope dilution with 18O-labeled water. RMR was measured at least twice using an open-circuit indirect calorimetry system with a ventilated hood. The results indicate that the different methods for assessing body composition vary substantially and should not be used interchangeably. Anthropometry was not adequate to assess group differences in body fatness, although skinfold measures may be appropriate for within-group comparisons. BIA correlated well with the isotope-dilution technique and may be a useful measure of FFM. Finally, RMR was lower in the old men than the young (1.04 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.24 +/- 0.03 kcal/min, P less than 0.001) and remained lower even when adjusted for FFM estimated by isotope dilu…
2314595	Cerebrospinal fluid production is reduced in healthy aging.	aging	1990-03-??	In order to study age-related differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production in humans, we measured the rate of CSF production in 7 young (age 21 to 36 years) and 7 elderly (age 67 to 84 years) healthy volunteers, using a modified Masserman method. In addition, we evaluated CSF protein gradients by collecting CSF in serial fractions up to the 30th ml and assaying for total protein concentration. The mean rate of CSF production was significantly less in the elderly than in the young subjects. Mean CSF total protein concentrations were higher in the elderly than in the young, and significant rostrocaudal protein gradients with similar slopes were present in both groups. However, there was no correlation between CSF production and CSF total protein concentrations or protein gradient slopes. Age-related reductions in CSF production, together with the ventricular dilatation that occurs with aging, should presumably result in reduced CSF turnover and therefore influence measured concent…
25261907	Plasticity of brain and cognition in older adults.	aging	2014-11-??	Aging is typically related to changes in brain and cognition, but the aging process is heterogeneous and differs between individuals. Recent research has started investigating the influence of cognitive and physical training on cognitive performance, functional brain activity, and brain structure in old age. The functional relevance of neural changes and the interactions among these changes following interventions is still a matter of debate. Here we selectively review research on structural and functional brain correlates of training-induced performance changes in healthy older adults and present exemplary longitudinal intervention studies sorted by the type of training applied (i.e., strategy-based training, process-specific training, and physical exercise). Although many training studies have been conducted recently, within each task domain, the number of studies that used comparable methods and techniques to assess behavioral and neural changes is limited. We suggest that future st…
30554819	Effects of dynamic loading on solute transport through the human cartilage endplate.	aging	2019-??-23	Nutrient and metabolite transport through the cartilage endplate (CEP) is important for maintaining proper disc nutrition, but the mechanisms of solute transport remain unclear. One unresolved issue is the role of dynamic loading. In comparison to static loading, dynamic loading is thought to enhance transport by increasing convection. However, the CEP has a high resistance to fluid flow, which could limit solute convection. Here we measure solute transport through site-matched cadaveric human lumbar CEP tissues under static vs. dynamic loading, and we determine how the degree of transport enhancement from dynamic loading depends on CEP porosity and solute size. We found that dynamic loading significantly increased small and large solute transport through the CEP: on average, dynamic loading increased the transport of sodium fluorescein (376 Da) by a factor of 1.85 ± 0.64 and the transport of a large dextran (4000 Da) by a factor of 4.97 ± 3.05. Importantly, CEP porosity (0.65 ± 0.07; …
21194798	Telomere length and aging biomarkers in 70-year-olds: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.	aging	2012-07-??	Telomeres are nucleo-protein complexes at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes. They shorten each time a somatic cell replicates and this shortening is modulated by the effects of oxidative stress. Previous studies have associated telomere length with a number of age-related outcomes and it is hypothesized to be a quantitative indicator of aging. We tested this hypothesis in a cohort of ∼1000 relatively healthy 70-year-old Scots (the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936: LBC1936) on whom we have measures of cognition, physical health and associated traits, and social class. Telomeres were significantly longer in males than females (p < 0.0001). Longer telomeres were associated, in females only, with higher general cognitive ability scores (p = 0.022) and lower C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.014). Telomere length was not associated with any of the other measured cognitive, physical, or social traits. In conclusion we find little evidence that telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal …
23347073	Development of the Thai healthy aging model: A grounded theory study.	aging	2013-06-??	To develop a model of healthy aging from the perspective of Thais, a grounded theory approach, including in-depth interviews and focus groups, was used. A purposive sample of 39 community-dwelling adults aged 40-85 years old was interviewed. The Thai healthy aging model composed of three themes: normality, nature, and dharma. In Thai, they are called tham-ma-da, tham-ma-chat, and tham-ma, or "Thai 3Ts". The theme of normality encompasses subthemes of staying physically active by being involved in plenty of physical activities, and being mentally active with creative and thoughtful hobbies and work. The theme of nature encompasses subthemes of living simply and being careful with money. The theme of dharma encompasses subthemes of enjoyment through helping family and participating in community activities, staying away from stress and worries by talking openly and honestly with someone, making merit, and helping other people without expecting anything in return. A greater understanding o…
19698803	Energy expenditure and aging.	lifespan, aging	2010-01-??	The study of energy expenditure (EE) has deep roots in understanding aging and lifespan in all species. In humans, total EE decreases substantially in advanced age resulting from parallel changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and activity EE. For RMR, this reduction appears to be due to a reduction in organ mass and specific metabolic rates of individual tissues. However, these anatomical changes explain very little regarding the decline in activity EE, which is governed by both genetic and environmental sources. The biological control centers for activity EE are closely coupled with body mass fluctuations and seem to originate in the brain. Several candidate neuromodulators may be involved in the age-related reduction of activity EE that include: orexin, agouti-related proteins and dopaminergic pathways. Unfortunately, the existing body of research has primarily focused on how neuromodulators influence weight gain and only a few studies have been performed in aging models. Recent ev…
20230141	Are processing speed tasks biomarkers of cognitive aging?	aging	2010-03-??	We examined the association between 5 processing speed measures and general cognitive ability in a large (>900) sample of relatively healthy men and women at age 70. The processing speed tests were the Wechsler Digit Symbol-Coding and Symbol Search, simple reaction time, 4-choice reaction time, and inspection time. To inquire whether the processing speed tasks might be biomarkers of cognitive aging, we examined the attenuations in their associations with general cognitive ability after adjusting for cognitive ability measured almost 60 years earlier. With the exception of inspection time, the attenuations were substantial. Inspection time was the only processing speed measure--all of which were measured at age 70--whose correlation with cognitive ability at age 70 was significantly greater than the correlation with cognitive ability at age 11. In old age, individual differences in most commonly used measures of processing speed are largely dependent on childhood cognitive ability. For …
16021807	Age and ageism: inhabiting the lives of healthy older adults through video narratives.	aging	2005-06-??	When applied humanities is used as a framework, the educational innovation described in this article provides a more balanced view of aging than occurs in most nursing programs. Five video narratives and focused discussion questions, intended to mitigate the "otherness" of old age, are described. Rationales and sample student responses are provided.
26752635	Disposable Soma Theory and the Evolution of Maternal Effects on Ageing.	lifespan	2016-??-??	Maternal effects are ubiquitous in nature and affect a wide range of offspring phenotypes. Recent research suggests that maternal effects also contribute to ageing, but the theoretical basis for these observations is poorly understood. Here we develop a simple model to derive expectations for (i) if maternal effects on ageing evolve; (ii) the strength of maternal effects on ageing relative to direct environmental effects; and (iii) the predicted relationships between environmental quality, maternal age and offspring lifespan. Our model is based on the disposable soma theory of ageing, and the key assumption is thus that mothers trade off their own somatic maintenance against investment in offspring. This trade-off affects the biological age of offspring at birth in terms of accumulated damage, as indicated by biomarkers such as oxidative stress or telomere length. We find that the optimal allocation between investment in maternal somatic investment and investment in offspring results i…
15246117	Influence of aging on serum phenytoin concentrations: a pharmacokinetic analysis based on therapeutic drug monitoring data.	aging	????-??-??	The influence of aging on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin at steady-state was evaluated retrospectically by comparing apparent oral clearance values (CL/F) in 75 patients aged 65-90 years (mean, 71.7 +/- 5.3 years) receiving phenytoin alone (n = 58) or in combination with phenobarbital (n = 17) and in an equal number of control patients aged 20-50 years (mean, 36.7 +/- 8.5 years) matched for gender, body weight, and comedication. All data were derived from the database of the therapeutic drug monitoring service (TDMS) of an academic neurological hospital. On average, elderly patients were found to exhibit slightly higher CL/F values compared with controls (14.6 +/- 4.7 ml h(-1) kg(-1) versus 13.1 +/- 4.2 ml h(-1) kg(-1), P < 0.05), the difference being probably related to the dose-dependent nature of phenytoin metabolism and the fact that elderly patients received lower dosages (4.4 +/- 1.1 mg kg(-1)day(-1) versus 5.3 +/- 1.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1), P < 0.001) and had lower serum phenytoi…
21078783	The gastric emptying study with oatmeal: reference range and reproducibility as a function of age and sex.	aging	2010-12-??	UNLABELLED: This study evaluated the reference range and reproducibility of the gastric emptying study with oatmeal as a function of age and sex.    METHODS: Twenty-four healthy subjects, 12 men and 12 women, categorized into 3 age groups, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-80 y, were studied twice, 1 d apart, with instant oatmeal labeled with (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid. Imaging was performed in the upright position using the left anterior oblique (LAO), right posterior oblique (RPO), anterior, and posterior projections. One-minute digital images acquired every 15 min for 60 min were used to calculate a simple half-time of emptying.    RESULTS: A strong correlation was found among half-times of gastric emptying calculated from the anterior projection, LAO projection, anterior-posterior geometric mean, and LAO-RPO geometric mean (P < 0.01). A significant inverse correlation was found between increasing age and decreasing half-time of emptying in men and women (P < 0.05). A reference range of 10-60 min is…

CONTEXT: Analyzing ligament stiffness between males and females at 3 maturational stages across the lifespan may provide insight into whether changes in ligament behavior with aging may contribute to joint laxity.    OBJECTIVE: To compare the stiffness of the medial structures of the tibiofemoral joint and the medial collateral ligament to determine if there are differences at 3 distinct ages and between the sexes.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.    SETTING: Laboratory.    PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 108 healthy and physically active volunteers with no previous knee surgery, no acute knee injury, and no use of exogenous hormones in the past 6 months participated. They were divided into 6 groups based on sex and age (8-10, 18-40, 50-75 years).    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ligament stiffness of the tibiofemoral joint was measured with an arthrometer in 0° and 20° of tibiofemoral-joint flexion. The slope values of the force-strain line that represents stiffness of the medi…
9061123	Effects of energy imbalance on energy expenditure and respiratory quotient in young and older men: a summary of data from two metabolic studies.	aging	1996-12-??	The roles of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in energy regulation, and the effects of factors such as aging on these parameters, remain uncertain. A re-analysis of data from two studies involving overfeeding or underfeeding in young men (22.7 +/- 0.6 [SEM] years) and older men (68.0 +/- 1.50 years) was conducted to further evaluate the adaptive capacity of energy expenditure and respiratory quotient to an increase or a decrease in energy intake. Changes in total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) in response to energy imbalance were compared between subjects undergoing overfeeding by 4.1 MJ/day for 21 days, or underfeeding by 3.2 MJ/day for 21 days. Comparing responses to overfeeding or underfeeding, there was a significant TEE response to energy imbalance averaging 1.39 MJ/day and equivalent to 19% of the alteration in energy intake (p < 0.05). There was also a significant REE response to energy imbalance averaging 0.…
27294712	Temporal orienting of attention can be preserved in normal aging.	aging	2016-??-??	Being able to orient our attention to moments in time is crucial for optimizing behavioral performance. In young adults, flexible cue-based temporal expectations have been shown to modulate perceptual functions and enhance behavioral performance. Recent studies with older individuals have reported significant deficits in cued temporal orienting. To investigate the extent of these deficits, the authors conducted 3 studies in healthy old and young adults. For each study, participants completed 2 tasks: a reaction time (RT) task that emphasized speeded responding and a nonspeeded rapid-serial-visual-presentation task that emphasized visual discrimination. Auditory cues indicated the likelihood of a target item occurring after a short or long temporal interval (foreperiod; 75% validity). In the first study, cues indicating a short or a long foreperiod were manipulated across blocks. The second study was designed to replicate and extend the first study by manipulating the predictive tempora…
8377593	Age-related accumulation of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide in cultured human diploid cells and its prevention by alpha-tocopherol.	lifespan, aging	1993-08-??	The levels of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide in serially cultured human fetal diploid fibroblasts at various population doubling levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with chemiluminescence detection. This methodology utilizes a mixture of cytochrome c and luminol as post-column hydroperoxide group specific luminescent reagents. The cellular hydroperoxide content increased with age from 0.34 to 27.72 pmol/10(6) cells. At the end of the cells' in vitro lifespan (51st population doubling level), the hydroperoxide content per 10(6) cells reached about 80 times the level found in cells of the 20th population doubling level. Supplementation of exogenous alpha-tocopherol to the culture medium prevented hydroperoxide accumulation, but did not extend the lifespan in vitro. The results indicate that substantial intracellular phospholipid hydroperoxide accumulation occurred in the course of aging of human fetal diploid fibroblasts.
22742812	Protein carbonylation and metabolic control systems.	aging	2012-08-??	Oxidative stress is linked to the production of reactive lipid aldehydes that non-enzymatically alkylate cysteine, histidine, or lysine residues in a reaction termed protein carbonylation. Reactive lipid aldehydes and their derivatives are detoxified via a variety of phase I and phase II systems, and when antioxidant defenses are compromised or oxidative conditions are increased, protein carbonylation is increased. The resulting modification has been implicated as causative in a variety of metabolic states including neurodegeneration, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, and aging. Although such modifications usually result in loss of protein function, protein carbonylation may be regulatory and activate signaling pathways involved in antioxidant biology and cellular homeostasis.
30707658	Frontal Lobe Functions in Normal Aging: Metacognition, Autonomy, and Quality of Life.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Starting from the "frontal lobe hypothesis of cognitive aging", we aim to study the metacognitive functions (deception, reciprocity, cognitive and affective theory of mind), autonomy and quality of life in normal aging.    METHODS: Eighty healthy subjects (30 young adults [YA] aged 20-40, 30 old adults [OA] aged 65-79 and 20 very old adults [VOA] aged 80 and over) participated in our study. Standard and novel neuropsychological tasks have been used, assessing abilities to understand others' mental and affective states, deceptive and cooperative situations.    RESULTS: OA and VOA's performances are significantly poorer than those of YA on first-/second-order false beliefs, deception, reciprocity and emotion recognition tasks. VOA have made more errors than other participants on control false beliefs, general cognition, and memory tasks. Normal aging seems also to be characterized by a reduction in processing speed. The level of instrumental activities of daily living decreas…
25950597	Basal level of autophagy is increased in aging human skin fibroblasts in vitro, but not in old skin.	aging	2015-??-??	Intracellular autophagy (AP) is a stress response that is enhanced under conditions of limitation of amino acids, growth factors and other nutrients, and also when macromolecules become damaged, aggregated and fibrillated. Aging is generally accompanied by an increase in intracellular stress due to all the above factors. Therefore, we have compared the basal levels of AP in serially passaged human facial skin fibroblasts undergoing aging and replicative senescence in vitro, and ex vivo in the skin biopsies from the photo-protected and photo-exposed area of the arms of 20 healthy persons of young and old ages. Immunofluorescence microscopy, employing antibodies against a specific intracellular microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (LC3) as a well established marker of AP, showed a 5-fold increase in the basal level of LC3 in near senescent human skin fibroblasts. However, no such age-related increase in LC3 fluorescence and AP could be detected in full thickness skin sections f…
11339987	Thalamic volume predicts performance on tests of cognitive speed and decreases in healthy aging. A magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric analysis.	aging	2001-06-??	Recent studies have indicated a role for the thalamus in attention, arousal and the capacity to perform tasks of speeded information processing. The present study evaluated the role of the thalamus in age-related cognitive decline by investigating the correlations between thalamic volume, cognition and age. This was done in 57 healthy subjects ranging from 21 to 82 years of age. All subjects underwent neurocognitive testing with information processing tests and structural magnetic resonance imaging. A significant decrease in volume of the thalamus with increasing age was found, relatively stronger than and independent of the decrease of total brain volume. The decrease of thalamic volume was apparent before the onset of loss of volume of the total brain. Over the age-span studied, the thalamic decrease in volume correlated with the diminished performance on tests of cognitive speed. Additionally, in young and middle-aged, but not in old subjects, the size of the thalamus predicted perf…
12383577	Attenuated cardiovascular reserve during prolonged submaximal cycle exercise in healthy older subjects.	aging	2002-10-02	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the effect of age on the hemodynamic response to prolonged submaximal aerobic exercise in healthy volunteers.    BACKGROUND: Reductions in peak work rate, heart rate (HR), and left ventricular (LV) emptying but higher blood pressure (BP) and systemic vascular resistance occur in healthy older versus younger humans during short bursts of graded maximal aerobic exercise. However, the effect of aging on the cardiovascular response to prolonged exercise at submaximal work rates typical of daily aerobic activities remains unknown.    METHODS: We evaluated cardiovascular performance throughout prolonged submaximal upright cycle ergometry in 40 carefully screened healthy untrained volunteers, 8 men and 12 women <50 years old, mean = 37 +/- 8 years (younger), and 10 men and 10 women >/=50 years old, mean = 66 +/- 9 years (older), during upright cycle exercise at 70% of peak cycle oxygen consumption (VO(2)) to exhaustion or a maximum of 120 min…
9222751	Influence of visual control, conduction, and central integration on static and dynamic balance in healthy older adults.	aging	1997-??-??	Aging is associated with decreased balance abilities, resulting in an increased risk of fall. In order to appreciate the visual, somatosensory, and central signals involved in balance control, sophisticated methods of posturography assessment have been developed, using static and dynamic tests, eventually associated with electromyographic measurements. We applied such methods to a population of healthy older adults in order to appreciate the respective importance of each of these sensorial inputs in aging individuals. Posture control parameters were recorded on a force-measuring platform in 41 healthy young (age 28.5 +/- 5.9 years) and 50 older (age 69.8 +/- 5.9 years) adults, using a static test and two dynamic tests performed by all individuals first with eyes open, then with eyes closed. The distance covered by the center of foot pressure, sway area, and anteroposterior oscillations were significantly higher, with eyes open or closed, in older people than in young subjects. Signific…
19464391	Suicidal function of DNA methylation in age-related genome disintegration.	lifespan, aging	2009-10-??	This article is dedicated to the 60th anniversary of 5-methylcytosine discovery in DNA. Cytosine methylation can affect genetic and epigenetic processes, works as a part of the genome-defense system and has mutagenic activity; however, the biological functions of this enzymatic modification are not well understood. This review will put forward the hypothesis that the host-defense role of DNA methylation in silencing and mutational destroying of retroviruses and other intragenomic parasites was extended during evolution to most host genes that have to be inactivated in differentiated somatic cells, where it acquired a new function in age-related self-destruction of the genome. The proposed model considers DNA methylation as the generator of 5mC>T transitions that induce 40-70% of all spontaneous somatic mutations of the multiple classes at CpG and CpNpG sites and flanking nucleotides in the p53, FIX, hprt, gpt human genes and some transgenes. The accumulation of 5mC-dependent mutations …
28130120	Trifluoroacetylated tyrosine-rich D-tetrapeptides have potent antioxidant activity.	aging	2017-??-??	The term "oxidative stress" indicates a set of chemical reactions unleashed by a disparate number of events inducing DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein modification and other effects, which are responsible of altering the physiological status of cells or tissues. Excessive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels may accelerate ageing of tissues or induce damage of biomolecules thus promoting cell death or proliferation in dependence of cell status and of targeted molecules. In this context, new antioxidants preventing such effects may have a relevant role as modulators of cell homeostasis and as therapeutic agents. Following an approach of peptide libraries synthesis and screening by an ORAC assay, we have isolated potent anti-oxidant compounds with well-defined structures. Most effective peptides are N-terminally trifluoroacetylated (CF) and have the sequence tyr-tyr-his-pro or tyr-tyr-pro-his. Slight changes in the sequence or removal of the CF group strongly reduced antioxidant ab…
1592879	Exercise training delineates the importance of B-cell dysfunction to the glucose intolerance of human aging.	aging	1992-06-??	Aging has been associated with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and diminished islet B-cell function. The relative contribution of these factors to the aging-associated changes in glucose tolerance has been difficult to discern, particularly so for B-cell function, since insulin sensitivity itself is a determinant of B-cell function and, therefore, comparisons of insulin levels and responses between old and young subjects are difficult. To reduce this effect, we compared B-cell function in 14 healthy older men (aged 61-82 yr; body mass index, 21-30 kg/m2), who were exercise trained for 6 months to improve insulin sensitivity, to that of 11 healthy young men (aged 24-31 yr; body mass index, 19-31 kg/m2), who were also trained. Insulin-glucose interactions were assessed by measuring indices of insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness at zero insulin (GEZI) using Bergman's minimal model. B-Cell function was assessed by determining the acute insulin resp…
30884412	Sleep EEG functional connectivity varies with age and sex, but not general intelligence.	aging	2019-??-??	Variations in the anatomical and functional connectivity between brain areas underlie both healthy and pathological variation in psychological measures. Largely independent from external stimuli, the sleep EEG is particularly well suited to measure individual variations in functional brain connectivity. In this study of 172 healthy individuals (17-69 years old), we show that functional connectivity between distant brain areas-reflected by the weighted phase lag index of the sleep EEG-is strongly affected by the age and sex of participants. Both NREM and REM connectivity in the theta and beta range increased with age, whereas a decrease was seen in the sigma range. Connectivity was substantially greater in females than in males in the high sigma frequency range, but an opposite pattern was seen in the alpha/low sigma and beta range. General intelligence was not significantly associated with connectivity in either sex. Our results confirm strong age effects on sleep spindle-frequency act…
20021411	Aging, mitochondria and male reproductive function.	aging	2009-12-??	The rise in life expectancy over the last century, together with higher maternal and paternal ages and have highlighted the issue of reduced fertility with advancing age. Aging of the male reproductive system is incited by multi-factorial changes at molecular, cellular and regulatory levels, and individual characteristics are highly variable, although strongly influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors. Damage accumulated with age leads to progressive deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and of local auto/paracrine interactions, thereby inducing changes in target organs such as the testis, penis and prostate. Elderly human males produce less testosterone, have fewer motile sperm and a higher incidence of erectile dysfunction and prostate disorders, all of which contribute to lower fertility. Cellular aging can manifest itself at several levels. Aging cells progressively accumulate "waste" products, resulting in a decreased functionally. Changes to mitochondria…
3546473	Insulin action in aging man: evidence for tissue-specific differences at low physiologic insulin levels.	aging	1987-03-??	This study examined the effect of age on insulin action in several tissues. Euglycemic insulin clamp studies were performed on healthy young (n = 7, 20 to 35 years, 10 and 20 mU/m2 X min insulin infusions) and old (n = 7, 66 to 80 years, 8 and 16 mU/m2 X min insulin infusions) adults. Insulin values were similar during both the lower (young, 24 +/- 1.6, old, 24 +/- 2.1 microU/ml) and higher (young, 40 +/- 3.3; old, 39 +/- 3.8 microU/ml) insulin infusion rates. Although suppression of hepatic glucose output (HGO) was more rapid (p less than .05) in the elderly group at each dose, HGO was eventually suppressed to similar levels in both age groups (low dose: young, 34.4 +/- 10.8, old, 25.3 +/- 1.8 mg/m2 X min; higher dose: young, 22.8 +/- 10.2, old, 6.2 +/- 2.1 mg/m2 X min). Glucose disposal was less (p less than .01) in the aged group at both insulin infusion rates. Suppression of C-peptide was slower in the elderly participants (p less than .05) in the low dose study. Suppression of fre…
8585879	Variability in the arterial pressure of newborns as compared to that of adults and old men.	aging	1995-10-??	The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was monitored on healthy subjects of different ages, spanning from newborns (24-48 hs old, to elderly age (70-80 years old). Each subject was monitored for 15 minutes, and the pressure values collected every minute. This protocol allowed a statistical evaluation of both inter- and intraindividual variabilities among and within different class ages. As expected, increasing age is paralleled by a marked increase in the average values of systolic blood pressure; the trend of variabilities around the average, however, as traced by standard deviations, is just the opposite: a marked decrease going from newborns to adults is accompanied--in most cases--by a statistically significant difference in the same direction also between adults and old men. This can be rationalized, in the light of recent findings on the role of deterministic chaos in the functional behaviour of complex biological systems, in terms of decreased functional flexibility character…
9298459	Stay safe! Stay healthy! Surviving old age in prison.	aging	1997-09-??	Although elderly inmates form a small minority in the U.S. prison population (6.6%), this number is expected to increase by 2005. Elderly prisoners consist of first-time offenders, habitual offenders, and those who have "aged in place" (received very long sentences at a young age). Violence is an identified stressor affecting the elderly prisoner. This enduring stressor can add to physical deterioration, particularly in the inmate with chronic illness. Violence in prison falls into three categories: prisoner-prisoner, staff-prisoner, or prisoner-staff (Clear & Cole, 1994). Prisoner-prisoner incidents account for the majority of violence within prison systems. The convict in today's prison will use extremes of violence to combat threats to his or her reputation or self-concept of "machismo," or if the inmate feels "disrespected." The aging prisoner may have chronic, pervasive stress levels disguised under a tough veneer, although he or she may no longer be strong enough physically or em…
26572156	Description and cohort characterization of the Longevity Study: learning from our elders.	longevity, aging	2016-10-??	The purpose of this article is to describe the Longevity Study: Learning From Our Elders, a research program on healthy aging that began in 2007 at the Center for Healthy Aging at Banner Sun Health Research Institute. As of June 2015, 1139 participants (age range of 50-110 years) completed baseline assessments with the majority living in the Sun Cities retirement communities northwest of Phoenix, Arizona but expanding throughout the state. The registry includes over 830 currently active participants with 450 aged 80 years and older, 188 aged 90 and older, and 27 centenarians. Data from in-person interviews at the Center for Healthy Aging in Sun City or in the participants' residences which includes sociodemographic, medical, cognitive, physical and psychosocial variables have been collected since the study's inception. This paper outlines some of the key demographic and clinical characteristics of the Longevity Study, its progress, and future directions. It also reflects on how excepti…
16860007	The compositional and physicochemical homogeneity of male femoral cortex increases after the sixth decade.	aging	2006-12-??	The temporal and spatial fluctuations in the dynamics of secondary osteonal remodeling impart heterogeneity to the compositional quality of bone. Bone mineral density (BMD) fails to reflect this heterogeneity as being a single score, and thus it cannot resolve the overlap between healthy individuals and those who experience fractures. Such information on tissue heterogeneity is lacking in the literature. In the current study, specimens were prepared from mid-diaphyseal portions of human femora (N=16, age range 52-85 years old) and grouped based on the anatomical location (anterior, lateral, medial and posterior quadrants). Raman microscopy was used to obtain multiple measurements from each specimen which allowed the construction of histograms of mineralization, crystallinity and carbonation. The coefficient of variation (COV) and skewness were extracted from histograms as measures of heterogeneity. Results demonstrated that average mineralization of the medial quadrant and the data poo…
22985469	Angiotensin II potentiates α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in the elderly.	aging	2013-03-??	Aging is characterized by increased sympatho-excitation, expressed through both the α-adrenergic and RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone) pathways. Although the independent contribution of these two pathways to elevated vasoconstriction with age may be substantial, significant cross-talk exists that could produce potentiating effects. To examine this interaction, 14 subjects (n=8 young, n=6 old) underwent brachial artery catheterization for administration of AngII (angiotensin II; 0.8-25.6 ng/dl per min), NE [noradrenaline (norepinephrine); 2.5-80 ng/dl per min] and AngII with concomitant α-adrenergic antagonism [PHEN (phentolamine); 10 μg/dl per min]. Ultrasound Doppler was utilized to determine blood flow, and therefore vasoconstriction, in both infused and contralateral (control) limbs. Arterial blood pressure was measured directly, and sympathetic nervous system activity was assessed via microneurography and plasma NE analysis. AngII sensitivity was significantly greater in the old…
12834027	Erectile function in elderly: role of androgens.	aging	2003-??-??	Erectile function progressively declines with age, although most old men's erectile rigidity remains adequate for vaginal intercourses. Recently it has been demonstrated that a significant proportion of men over 60 years of age has a biochemical hypogonadism (defined as below the 2.5th percentile for young men). It is generally accepted that erectile response in mammals is regulated by androgens both centrally and peripherically, but in male ageing a casual relationship between androgen levels and erectile function has not been established yet. The present study was designed to evaluate the possible relationships between circulating androgens and sexual activity in a group of healthy old men without erectile dysfunction. Forty men with a mean age of 68 +/- 6 years (range 61-75 years) were recruited among healthy subjects undergoing periodic health screening. The control group consisted of 30 young volunteers with a mean age of 33 +/- 5 years (range 26-40 years). These subjects had good…
28187153	What matters for life satisfaction among the oldest-old? Evidence from China.	longevity, aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVE: The world population is aging rapidly and the well-being of older people is of great interest. Therefore, this study investigates the determinants of life satisfaction among the oldest-old (i.e. individuals aged 80 or over) in China.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the 2011/2012 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data (n = 6530) for this paper. Logistic regression is used to analyse the effects of socio-demographic, economic, health, instrumental activities of daily living, family and community factors on life satisfaction and depression among the oldest-old in China.    RESULTS: Our analysis confirms the significance of many factors affecting life satisfaction among the oldest-old in China. Factors that are correlated with life satisfaction include respondent's sex, education, place of residence, self-rated health status, cognitive ability (using mini mental state examination), regular physical examination, perceived relative economic status, access to social se…
12917752	Native protein glycoxidation and aging.	aging	2003-??-??	Structural and functional alterations of proteins are observed during aging. Glycation of long half-life proteins, involving reducing carbohydrates, leads to the formation of intra and intermolecular cross-links and the production of free radicals. These processes depend on the amount of glucose available and on molecular oxygen which contributes to the production of free radicals. These processes are observed without dysfunction of carbohydrate metabolism and progress with age. However, whether this process is a primary cause or a consequence of aging remains a question of debate. Prevention of excessive glycoxidation could be a goal of recommendations designed to control the tissular alterations occurring in aging.
16195216	Age-related changes in oxidative DNA damage and benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide-I (BPDE-I)-DNA adduct levels in human stomach.	aging	2005-10-08	This study was conducted in order to obtain information on the association between age and oxidative DNA damage and benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide-I (BPDE-I)-DNA adduct levels in the stomach tissues of normal subjects (n = 113). Subjects ranged from 17 to 75 yr. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD). BPDE-I-DNA adduct levels were quantitatively measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the monoclonal antibody 8E11. Increase in 8-OHdG levels was observed in subjects from 31 to 60 yr of age. Higher levels of 8-OHdG were observed in the stomach tissues of those in the 51-60 yr old group. Although Helicobacter. Pylori-positive group subjects had higher 8-OHdG levels than those in the H. pylori-negative group, no age-related changes in 8-OHdG levels were observed in these groups. The levels of BPDE-I-DNA adduct also markedly increased w…
8704202	Nonrandom X-inactivation patterns in normal females: lyonization ratios vary with age.	aging	1996-07-01	The utility of X-inactivation based clonality assays for evaluation of human neoplasia is well-documented. However, excessive Lyonization is a potential limitation of these assays, because it mimics clonal derivation of cells. The incidence of excessive Lyonization in healthy females is controversial, with reported incidence varying from 4% to 33%. Several explanations have been offered for the observed variation, including different criteria for excessive Lyonization, diversity of X-linked clonality assays, small population sizes and more recently, tissue specificity of X-inactivation patterns. However, it is also possible that stem cell depletion, clonal hematopoiesis, or selection pressures on blood cells results in an increased incidence of excessive skewing. If any of the latter is true, then the incidence of excessive skewing should increase with age in blood cells. To test this hypothesis, we determined X-inactivation ratios at the human androgen receptor locus of 295 normal fem…
8845565	Effect of aging on the esophageal motor functions.	aging	1996-04-??	To clarify the changes of esophageal motility along with age, we performed esophageal manometry on 47 healthy volunteers, and compared the values of four groups under 49 years old (n = 11), 50 to 59 (n = 15), 60 to 69 (n = 11), and over 70 years old (n = 10). Resting lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in the group over 70 years old showed the tendency of decrease, but not statistically significant. Nadir LES pressure on swallow-induced relaxation was not statistically different among 4 groups. On esophageal body testing, percentage of non-conduction sequence in the group 60 to 69 and over 70 years old was statistically higher compared with that of the group under 49 years old (p < 0.05) but spared in some elderly subjects. Percentage of simultaneous contractions was not statistically different among 4 groups. Peristaltic contraction amplitude in the group over 70 years old was significantly lower than that of the group under 49 years old both at the level of 5 cm above (p < 0.01…
25064432	Is faster better? Effects of response deadline on ERP correlates of recognition memory in younger and older adults.	aging	2014-09-25	Aging studies generally suggest that recollection is impaired whereas familiarity-based recognition remains relatively preserved in healthy older adults. The present event-related potential (ERP) study explores whether age-related impairments in recognition memory can be reduced under conditions in which recognition decisions are primarily driven by familiarity. Old and young adults performed an item recognition task with perceptually rich visual stimuli. A response deadline procedure was employed following previous studies which have shown that limiting response times attenuates recollection but leaves familiarity relatively unaffected. Age effects on memory performance were large in the non-speeded response condition in which recollection contributes to performance. When response time was limited, performance differences between groups were negligible. In the non-speeded condition the ERP correlate of recollection was not detectable in old adults. Conversely, in the speeded condition…
21256026	Aging modifies joint power and work when gait speeds are matched.	aging	2011-03-??	It is well known that ankle joint power generation (A2) is reduced in healthy older adults (OG) during gait. No general consensus exists, however, as to what fundamental compensatory actions are made at the knee and hip joints by the OG to compensate for this loss of power. The failure to control gait speed may account for this lack of agreement. This study investigated the effect of aging on lower limb joint power and work during gait. The gait patterns of eight old (OG: 66.8±5.4 yr) and 12 young adults (YG: 26.6±2.9 yr) were recorded for a range of matched speeds (1.0 m s(-1), 1.3 m s(-1), 1.6 m s(-1)). Speed did not differ between the groups. Combining speeds, the OG generated 17% less A2 power and 21% less A2 work (p<0.05). Compared to the YG, the OG generated 46% more H1 work, 30% more H2 peak power, 16% more H3 peak power, 30% more K3 peak power and 19% more K4 peak power (p<0.05). These actions by the OG were associated with less ankle plantar-flexion, more hip flexion and anter…
21475376	Carbonyl formation in erythrocyte membrane proteins during aging in humans.	aging	2011-03-??	BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that oxidative stress increases with increasing human age. Protein carbonyl accumulation is an indicator of oxidative damage to proteins during aging in cells and tissues. The present study is focused on the relationship between human age and protein oxidation in erythrocyte membranes in a healthy Indian population.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample included healthy human subjects (n = 49) between the ages of 17 to 80 years. Their blood was collected and assayed spectrophotometrically for oxidative protein damage in terms of protein carbonyls and plasma antioxidant capacity in terms of FRAP.    RESULTS: Protein carbonyl content was found to increase in an age-related pattern indicating an increase in oxidative protein damage in older subjects (p <0.0001, r = 0.8269). There was also a significant negative correlation between protein oxidation and plasma antioxidant capacity measured in terms of ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) values (p<0.00…
12559601	Increased oxidative stress in younger as well as in older humans.	aging	2003-02-??	BACKGROUND: The free radical theory of aging is based upon the adverse effects of oxidative stress (OS), and indices of OS generally increase with advancing age. However, since OS may also be a normal physiological response in youth, when reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signal transducers during normal growth and development, we compared markers of OS in normal humans over a wide spectrum of different ages.    METHODS: Fasting breath samples were collected from 102 healthy volunteers (age 9 to 89 years) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were assayed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The intensity of OS in each volunteer was estimated by the breath methylated alkane contour (BMAC), a three-dimensional display of the abundance of C4-C20 alkanes and monomethylated alkanes. The collective abundance of these VOCs in a breath sample was reduced to a single value, the volume under curve (VUC), and correlated with chronological age.    RESULTS: Compared to subjects aged 20-…
9789739	Dendritic cell responsiveness to stimulation with influenza vaccine is unimpaired in old age.	aging	1998-09-??	We have previously demonstrated that whole virus influenza vaccine can activate dendritic cells (DC). In the present study we analyzed whether DC activation was affected by the aging process. For this reason the expression of immunoregulatory molecules and the production of cytokines were compared in blood-derived DC from old and young healthy individuals following stimulation with inactivated influenza virus. Unstimulated DC from young and old individuals had a similar surface expression of MHC class II and CD54 and secreted moderate amounts of IL-12 and TNF-alpha. Stimulation with influenza vaccine led to a marked increase in the production of surface molecules and cytokines. These changes were equally pronounced in cells from young and old individuals. Our results demonstrate that DC responsiveness to stimulation with a viral vaccine is unimpaired in old age. DC may, therefore, represent a potent tool for immunotherapy and may increase the efficacy of vaccines in the elderly.
2611793	Effects of aging on mucociliary clearance.	aging	1989-??-??	Preliminary results from the relationship between aging and mucociliary clearance of inhaled 99-Tc human albumin particles (0.92-2.5 microns) are reported from two groups of healthy non-smokers: 1) 20-61-year-old (mean 42 years) and 2) 71-90-year-old (mean 79.5 years). The analytical procedure is presented, and on the basis of the analysis it is concluded that there is evidence for an age-related decline of the mucociliary clearance by a bi-phasic curve, similar to those reported in the literature for other physiological functions.
7966871	Control of food intake in older men.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of aging on mechanisms of body energy regulation and thereby determine the causes of unexplained weight loss in older persons, a factor predisposing to premature death and disability.    DESIGN: Dietary intervention study.    SETTING: Metabolic ward and outpatient.    PARTICIPANTS: The subjects were 35 healthy younger and older men of normal body weight consuming a diet of typical composition and performing usual activities.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects were either overfed by a mean (+/- SD) of 4.09 (+/- 0.26) MJ/d (n = 17) or underfed by 3.17 (+/- 0.68) MJ/d (n = 18) for 21 days. Measurements were made of changes in body weight, body composition, and energy expenditure during overfeeding or underfeeding, and of subsequent voluntary nutrient intakes and changes in body weight.    RESULTS: There was no significant effect of aging on changes in body composition, body weight, or energy expenditure with overfeeding or underfeeding. However, follo…
18454278	Effects of age and pulmonary arterial hypertension on the different phases of right atrial function.	aging	2008-10-??	To evaluate the effects of age and pulmonary hypertension on phasic right atrial function we measured right atrial volumes at 3 different points in the cardiac cycle in 57 healthy subjects and 33 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Right atrial reservoir function was assessed by systolic filling volume and passive and active emptying by passive and active emptying volume and fraction of total emptying. We compared these phases of right atrial function in 30 healthy subjects <60 and 27 > or = 60 years old, and in a separate analysis, in 33 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and 33 matched controls. Healthy subjects > or =60 years had lower passive emptying fraction (46.0 +/- 23.3% vs 59.9 +/- 15.4%, P = 0.011) and larger active emptying volume (7.0 +/- 3.5 vs 4.9 +/- 2.5 ml/m2, P = 0.013 ) and fraction (54.0 +/- 23.3% vs 40.1 +/- 15.4%, P = 0.011) compared to those <60. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension had larger right atrial volumes, systolic filling …
3840838	Detection of 5-S-cysteinyldopamine in human brain.	aging	1985-??-??	5-S-Cysteinyldopamine was synthesized and used as reference compound in HPLC analyses of extracts from various regions of human brain. The compound could be detected in brain regions rich in dopamine (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra) but not in other regions (cerebellum, occipital cortex). The occurrence of 5-S-cysteinyldopamine in dopaminergic brain regions supports the hypothesis that dopamine in part undergoes autoxidation, leading to formation of highly reactive quinones. The newly discovered metabolite may prove useful in future studies of dopamine autoxidation and the possibly resultant cytotoxicity in aging and degenerative brain disorders.
20381674	Relation of high heart rate variability to healthy longevity.	longevity, aging	2010-04-15	The population's aging underscores the need to understand the process and define the physiologic markers predictive of healthy longevity. The findings that aging is associated with a progressive decrease in heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic function, suggests that longevity might depend on preservation of autonomic function. However, little is known about late life changes. We assessed the relation between autonomic function and longevity by a cross-sectional study of HRV of 344 healthy subjects, 10 to 99 years old. The HRV was determined from 24-hour Holter records, using 4 time domain measures of HRV (the root mean square of the successive normal sinus RR interval difference [rMSSD], percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms [pNN50], standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals during a 24-hour period [SDNN], and standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-minute segments [SDANN]). Autonomic modulation of the 4 measu…
18254875	Dietary protein intake affects albumin fractional synthesis rate in younger and older adults equally.	aging	2008-02-??	Inclusion of dietary protein in meals and beverages affects the hepatic synthesis of the protein albumin. Besides dietary protein, several factors can influence albumin metabolism and affect plasma albumin. The role of aging in albumin synthesis is unclear. Recent research documents that albumin synthesis rate is influenced comparably in younger and older adults by dietary protein ingestion and changes in dietary protein quantity. This emphasizes the importance for all adults to consume an adequate amount of dietary protein.
9502641	Twenty-four hour time domain heart rate variability and heart rate: relations to age and gender over nine decades.	aging	1998-03-01	OBJECTIVES: This study sought to define the effects of age and gender effects on the normal range of time domain heart rate variability (HRV) over nine decades in healthy subjects.    BACKGROUND: Low HRV is considered an independent marker of mortality risk. However, the age-related decline in HRV may limit its predictive value, particularly in the elderly. Delineation of the range of HRV in healthy subjects over the life span is needed. Gender-related differences in HRV also need clarification.    METHODS: We determined, according to decade, 24-h heart rate (HR) and HRV of 260 healthy subjects (10 to 99 years old; 112 male, 148 female) by means of five standard time domain measures: standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals over 24 h (SDNN), standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-mm segments (SDANN), mean of the standard deviations of all normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments (SDNN index), root-mean-square of successive normal sinus…
7626826	Reduced temporal lobe glucose metabolism in aging.	aging	1995-07-??	The results of a positron emission tomography study of regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose are reported for 8 healthy old subjects (mean age, 66 yr; standard deviation [SD], 5) and 9 young subjects (mean age, 27 yr; SD, 4.6) using a high-resolution positron emission tomograph and the glucose metabolic tracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Older subjects showed significantly lower cerebral metabolic rates than did the young subjects, in anterior, middle, and posterior temporal neocortex and in mesial temporal cortex, with the largest differences occurring in anterior temporal cortex (temporal pole). The current findings may reflect either decreases in regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose that occur with normal aging, or early indications of cognitive dysfunction that is associated with age-related disorders.
27370119	Aging effect on microcirculation: A multiscale entropy approach on laser speckle contrast images.	aging	2016-07-??	PURPOSE: It has long been known that age plays a crucial role in the deterioration of microvessels. The assessment of such deteriorations can be achieved by monitoring microvascular blood flow. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a powerful optical imaging tool that provides two-dimensional information on microvascular blood flow. The technique has recently been commercialized, and hence, few works discuss the postacquisition processing of laser speckle contrast images recorded in vivo. By applying entropy-based complexity measures to LSCI time series, we present herein the first attempt to study the effect of aging on microcirculation by measuring the complexity of microvascular signals over multiple time scales.    METHODS: Forearm skin microvascular blood flow was studied with LSCI in 18 healthy subjects. The subjects were subdivided into two age groups: younger (20-30 years old, n = 9) and older (50-68 years old, n = 9). To estimate age-dependent changes in microvascular blood…
16730388	Long-term heart rate variability as a predictor of patient age.	aging	2006-06-??	Patients age has been estimated in healthy population by means of the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters to assess the potentiality of HRV indexes as a biomarker of age. A long-term analysis of HRV has been performed, computing linear time and frequency domain parameters as well as non-linear metrics, in a dataset of 113 healthy subjects (age range 20-85 years old). The principal component analysis has been used to capture age-related influence on HRV and then three different models have been applied to predict subjects age: a robust linear regressor (RLR), a feedforward neural network (FFNN) and a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). A good prediction of patient age has been obtained (using all principal components, the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and real age: RLR=0.793; FFNN=0.872; RBFNN=0.829), even if an overestimation in younger subjects and an underestimation in older ones may be observed. The important and complementary contribution of non-li…
24869503	Resting-state slow wave power, healthy aging and cognitive performance.	aging	2014-05-29	Cognitive functions and spontaneous neural activity show significant changes over the life-span, but the interrelations between age, cognition and resting-state brain oscillations are not well understood. Here, we assessed performance on the Trail Making Test and resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings from 53 healthy adults (18-89 years old) to investigate associations between age-dependent changes in spontaneous oscillatory activity and cognitive performance. Results show that healthy aging is accompanied by a marked and linear decrease of resting-state activity in the slow frequency range (0.5-6.5 Hz). The effects of slow wave power on cognitive performance were expressed as interactions with age: For older (>54 years), but not younger participants, enhanced delta and theta power in temporal and central regions was positively associated with perceptual speed and executive functioning. Consistent with previous work, these findings substantiate further the important rol…
26248580	Appraising the Role of Iron in Brain Aging and Cognition: Promises and Limitations of MRI Methods.	aging	2015-09-??	Age-related increase in frailty is accompanied by a fundamental shift in cellular iron homeostasis. By promoting oxidative stress, the intracellular accumulation of non-heme iron outside of binding complexes contributes to chronic inflammation and interferes with normal brain metabolism. In the absence of direct non-invasive biomarkers of brain oxidative stress, iron accumulation estimated in vivo may serve as its proxy indicator. Hence, developing reliable in vivo measurements of brain iron content via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of significant interest in human neuroscience. To date, by estimating brain iron content through various MRI methods, significant age differences and age-related increases in iron content of the basal ganglia have been revealed across multiple samples. Less consistent are the findings that pertain to the relationship between elevated brain iron content and systemic indices of vascular and metabolic dysfunction. Only a handful of cross-sectional invest…
15050282	An investigation of DNA excision repair capacity in human CD4+ T cell clones as a function of age in vitro.	aging	2004-04-??	DNA damage has been shown to increase with age in lymphocytes of healthy humans and in human CD4+ T cell clones. Such genetic damage, if unrepaired, may have a detrimental effect on lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. This study investigated DNA excision repair capacity of human CD4+ T cell clones as a function of age in vitro. Cultures of T cell clones were treated with a range of DNA damaging agents; hydrogen peroxide, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 254 nm ultraviolet irradiation. Following treatment, the amount of DNA damage in the clones was determined over a time course using modified comet assays. The results obtained revealed a decline related to in vitro age in the DNA repair capacity of clones derived from a 26 and a 45 year old donor. This decline may represent at least a partial explanation for the age related increase in DNA damage in these clones when cultured in vitro. In contrast, there was no evidence for a decline related to in vitro age in repair capacity i…
20884015	Impact of aging on cerebral vasoregulation and parenchymal integrity.	aging	2010-12-15	UNLABELLED: Sufficient vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive reactivity of cerebral arterioles is an important prerequisite for adequate capillary perfusion. To appreciate its capacity during aging and to elucidate its impact on parenchymal integrity we undertook a correlation using ultrasonography and brain MRI. Sixty healthy persons with no stenoses in the carotid and vertebral arteries were examined by transcranial Doppler to assess middle cerebral artery mean flow velocities (MFV) at rest, after 30 s apnea and after 90 s hyperventilation. Young persons, N=20, with a mean age of 24.8 (20-32) were compared with the middle aged, N=20, 54.8 (40-63) and elderly, N=20, 76.2 (69-84). A different cohort of 40 elderly persons, with a mean age of 68.4 (57-85) were evaluated also by MRI using FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences. Their extent of leukoaraiosis measured by the Fazekas scale was correlated with their vasoregulatory capacity.    RESULTS: The steady state MFV in young persons, 71 cm/sec, d…
26549788	Aging and the complexity of center of pressure in static and dynamic postural tasks.	aging	2016-01-01	The experiment was set-up to investigate the hypothesis that there is an age-related bi-directional change in complexity of the center of pressure (COP) depending on postural task demands. Healthy young (19-28 year) and old (65-74 year) adults were instructed to match, in two 25s trials for each condition, the COP with constant and sine-wave targets at 2 levels (5 and 40%) of the maximal COP distance (MCD). The root mean square error of COP increased with aging in both MCD levels and tasks. Multi-scale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis showed that the complexity of COP in the old adults was lower compared to the young in the constant target, whereas it was higher in the sine-wave target. The task dependent age-related bi-directional change of COP complexity is counter to the hypothesis of a universal loss of complexity with aging but shows that there is loss of adaptive change in complexity driven by the COP dynamics.
18763884	Normal aging affects decisions under ambiguity, but not decisions under risk.	aging	2008-09-??	Old adults have to face many situations that require important decisions. In the present investigation, the authors examined the effects of aging on both decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk. To this purpose, healthy young and old adults completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Probability-Associated Gambling task (PAG task). Old adults performed the PAG task as well as young adults, demonstrating ability to make decisions when full information about the problem situation, the options' probabilities and the associated gains and losses was given. Differently, old adults showed poor performance on the IGT relative to young adults, indicating difficulty in making advantageous decisions under ambiguous conditions. Indeed, in the IGT, participants are not aware of the rules for gains and losses and have to learn about the utility of their selections through experience. Results of our analyses point to the contribution of executive functions to all types of decisions. Our…
28830800	Initiation of the age-related decline of odor identification in humans: A meta-analysis.	aging	2017-11-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is an important contributor to olfactory system deterioration in humans, leading to increased health and safety risks as well as affecting the quality of life. However, it is currently unknown when age-related olfactory deterioration begins in humans and thus when to initiate interventions to prevent or slow it.    OBJECTIVE: To determine the decade in which olfactory function begins to deteriorate in healthy humans by determining when odor identification is first impaired.    DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: Studies cited in the PubMed database were searched from its inception to March 2017 using the terms "olfac*" or "smell" and "ag*". The effect size of each comparison was calculated.    RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, the effect sizes as determined using Cohen's d for the comparisons between 30 and 39.9- and 40-49.9-year-olds was 0.06 (95% CI: -0.17 to 0.29), between 40-49.9-year-olds was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.20-1.04), considered a medium effect size, and between 35-55…
3571874	Wisconsin Card Sort Test performance in a healthy elderly population.	aging	1987-05-??	A 64-card version of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) was administered to 5 groups (n = 95), aged 17 to 25, 64 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79 and 80 to 87 years. The elderly groups were chosen for their lack of medical problems in order to determine if previously reported age-related deficits were due to chronic medical problems or to aging per se. The resulting pattern of means showed statistically significant differences only for number of categories attained and total number of errors. For both variables, the 80- to 87-year-old group performed more poorly than the 64- to 69-year-old group. These results, although consistent with previous findings suggestive of frontal lobe vulnerability in old age, indicate that deterioration is less marked for a healthy elderly population.
21875610	Tactile rod bisection in the absence of visuo-spatial processing in children, mid-age and older adults.	lifespan	2011-10-??	The effect of age on tactile rod bisection is explored in an attempt to fully understand lateralized biases that are not driven by prior experience or visual processing. In Experiment 1, a total of 549 healthy participants aged between 3 and 84 years of age, divided into eight age groups, used touch alone without vision to bisect one wooden rod. Participants across all age groups, except those approaching or in adolescence, showed pseudoneglect on tactile rod bisection. In Experiment 2 a total of 72 healthy participants aged between 6 and 96 years old, divided into three age groups, used touch alone without vision to bisect three wooden rods of different length. Experiment 2 showed pseudoneglect across the full adult life span and most notably in the oldest participants. For the youngest participants there was not a significant pseudoneglect bias but there was a significant effect of gender with females showing greater leftward bias than males. When participants scanned and bisected th…
29791788	Shift in skin microbiota of Western European women across aging.	aging	2018-09-??	AIMS: The objective of our study was to compare the microbiota diversity between two different age groups of Western European women.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Skin-swab samples were collected directly on the forehead of 34 healthy Western European women: 17 younger (21-31 years old) and 17 older individuals (54-69 years old). Bacterial communities were evaluated using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Data revealed a higher alpha diversity on the skin of older individuals compared with younger ones. Overall microbiota structure was different between the two age groups, as demonstrated by beta diversity analysis, which also highlighted a high interpersonal variation within older individuals. Furthermore, taxonomic composition analysis showed both an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Actinobacteria on the older skin. At the genus level, older skin exhibited a significant increase in Corynebacterium and a decrease in Propionibacterium relative abundance.    CONCLUSIONS: Our study rev…
23514135	Two thumbs up: using popular films in introductory aging courses.	aging	2014-??-??	Good teaching requires thoughtful planning and creative thinking, especially when trying to engage students in material that is unfamiliar to them or encumbered by stereotypes, like aging. Classic and contemporary media can provide unique teaching opportunities in gerontology classrooms. Popular films can have a powerful influence over viewers' attitudes and perceptions, and spur in-depth discussions of aging-related topics common to introductory aging courses (e.g., ageism, abuse, inequality, caregiving, healthy aging, and intimate relationships). Additionally, films appeal to multiple learning styles, engaging a variety of learners. This article examines the value of using films in introductory aging courses, offers strategies for incorporating films in the gerontology classroom, suggests sample activities and assignments that pair popular films with aging course topics, identifies challenges of using film in various classrooms settings, and provides a detailed typology of films on e…
28685910	The independent influences of age and education on functional brain networks and cognition in healthy older adults.	aging	2017-??-??	Healthy aging is accompanied by a constellation of changes in cognitive processes and alterations in functional brain networks. The relationships between brain networks and cognition during aging in later life are moderated by demographic and environmental factors, such as prior education, in a poorly understood manner. Using multivariate analyses, we identified three latent patterns (or modes) linking resting-state functional connectivity to demographic and cognitive measures in 101 cognitively normal elders. The first mode (P = 0.00043) captures an opposing association between age and core cognitive processes such as attention and processing speed on functional connectivity patterns. The functional subnetwork expressed by this mode links bilateral sensorimotor and visual regions through key areas such as the parietal operculum. A strong, independent association between years of education and functional connectivity loads onto a second mode (P = 0.012), characterized by the involvemen…
10956353	Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in young and older women and men.	aging	2000-09-??	It has been suggested that a decline in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is a general consequence of aging in humans. However, previous studies have not always controlled for the effects of varying levels of physical activity on muscle oxidative capacity. To test the hypothesis that, when matched for comparable habitual physical activity levels, there would be no age-related decline in the oxidative capacity of a locomotor muscle, the postexercise recovery time of phosphocreatine was compared in the tibialis anterior muscle of young [n = 19; 33.8 +/- 4.8 (SD) yr] and older [n = 18; 75.5 +/- 4.5 yr] healthy women and men of similar, relatively low, activity levels. The intramuscular metabolic measurements were accomplished by using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results indicate that there was no age effect on the postexercise recovery time of phosphocreatine recovery, thus supporting the stated hypothesis. These data suggest that there is no requisite decline in skel…

The trabecular meshwork (TM) is known to be subjected to different types of stress such as mechanical, oxidative, and phagocytic stress. Although short-term exposure to these stresses is expected to elicit adaptive responses, long-term exposure may lead to permanent alterations in the tissue physiology and contribute to the pathologic increase in aqueous humor outflow resistance frequently associated with glaucoma. A fuller understanding of the cell-specific and tissue-specific responses to stress in the TM, including changes in gene and protein expression, signal transduction, and potential pathogenic effects, could lead to novel prevention and therapeutic strategies for glaucoma. This review summarizes the current information available about how the TM responds to mechanical, oxidative, and phagocytic stress, as well as the evidence supporting the role that such responses may have in the alterations of the TM in aging and glaucoma.
6434323	Size and strength of the quadriceps muscles of old and young women.	aging	1984-08-??	Muscle weakness and wasting may be evaluated objectively by dynamometry and compound ultrasound imaging. We have measured the voluntary isometric strength of the quadriceps muscles of healthy women in their 70s (n = 25) and in their 20s (n = 25) and have compared it with the mid-thigh cross-sectional area of the same muscles. The two groups of women showed similar variability when strength was measured on consecutive days (coefficients of variation: 8%). The older women were 35% weaker than the young women (P less than 0.001) and their quadriceps cross-sectional area was 33% less (P less than 0.001). Quadriceps strength and cross-sectional area were correlated (r = 0.66, P less than 0.001, elderly; r = 0.53, P less than 0.01, young) and the principal axis of the relationship was closely similar for the two groups of women. There is therefore no difference in the intrinsic strength of the quadriceps muscles of healthy women in their third and eighth decades. This report also provides no…
24265284	Increase in tendon protein synthesis in response to insulin-like growth factor-I is preserved in elderly men.	aging	2014-01-01	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known to be an anabolic factor in tendon, and the systemic levels are reduced with aging. However, it is uncertain how tendon fibroblasts are involved in tendon aging and how aging cells respond to IGF-I. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo IGF-I stimulation of tendon protein synthesis in elderly compared with young men. We injected IGF-I in the patellar tendons of young (n = 11, 20-30 yr of age) and old (n = 11, 66-75 yr of age) men, and the acute fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of tendon protein was measured with the stable isotope technique and compared with the contralateral side (injected with saline as control). We found that tendons injected with IGF-I had significantly higher protein FSR compared with controls (old group: 0.018 ± 0.015 vs. 0.008 ± 0.008, young group: 0.016 ± 0.009 vs. 0.009 ± 0.006%/h, mean ± SE, P < 0.01). This increase in protein synthesis was seen in both young and old men, with no differences betw…
26370963	MicroRNAs in Salivary Exosome as Potential Biomarkers of Aging.	aging	2015-09-07	The aim of this study was to examine whether salivary exosomal miRNAs could be identified as aging biomarkers. Fifteen young healthy volunteers (median age, 21.0 years) and 13 old individuals (median age, 66.0 years) were recruited. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, salivary exosomes were isolated, and total RNA was extracted. In a microarray, 242 miRNAs were commonly detected in these two mixed samples. Based on the cut-off values of 2- or 0.5-fold changes (FC) and regulatory power for aging process, six candidate miRNAs (miR-24-3p, miR-371a-5p, miR-3175, miR-3162-5p, miR-671-5p, and miR-4667-5p) were selected. After comparing each total RNA obtained by the 15 young and 13 old individuals to validate the FC values using quantitative real-time PCR, miR-24-3p was identified as a novel candidate aging biomarker. This pilot study suggested that salivary exosomal miRNAs could be identified as candidate aging biomarkers. To confirm whether miR-24-3p in salivary exosomes are suitable …
24280618	Reduced pain inhibition is associated with reduced cognitive inhibition in healthy aging.	aging	2014-03-??	The analgesic effect of heterotopic noxious counter-stimulation (HNCS; "pain inhibits pain") has been shown to decrease in older persons, while some neuropsychological studies have suggested a reduction in cognitive inhibition with normal aging. Taken together, these findings may reflect a generalized reduction in inhibitory processes. The present study assessed whether the decline in the efficacy of pain inhibition processes is associated with decreased cognitive inhibition in older persons. Healthy young (18-46 years old; n=21) and older (56-75 years old; n=23) adult volunteers participated in one experimental session to assess the effect of HNCS (cold pain applied on the left forearm) on shock pain and RIII reflex induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the right sural nerve. In the same session, participants also performed a modified Stroop task, including a target condition requiring the frequent switching between inhibition and no inhibition of the meaning of color wo…
28647426	Age-related changes in structural connectivity are improved using subject-specific thresholding.	aging	2017-08-15	BACKGROUND: Deterministic diffusion tractography obtained from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) requires user-defined quantitative anisotropy (QA) thresholds. Most studies employ a common threshold across all subjects even though there is a strong degree of individual variation within groups. We sought to explore whether it would be beneficial to use individual thresholds in order to accommodate individual variance. To do this, we conducted two independent experiments.    METHOD: First, tractography of the arcuate fasciculus and network connectivity measures were examined in a sample of 14 healthy participants. Second, we assessed the effects of QA threshold on group differences in network connectivity measures between healthy young (n=19) and old (n=14) individuals.    RESULTS: The results of both experiments were significantly influenced by QA threshold. Common thresholds set too high failed to produce sufficient reconstructions in most subjects, thus decreasing the …
20633545	SIRT1 variants are associated with aging in a healthy Han Chinese population.	lifespan, aging	2010-11-11	BACKGROUND: Aging is influenced by diverse environmental and genetic risk factors. The SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) gene has been shown to regulate lifespan and aging in previous studies. We determined whether variation in the SIRT1 gene is associated with aging in healthy Chinese population.    METHODS: The study population comprised 482 healthy, unrelated Chinese subjects, of which 246 were aging individuals from 60 to 91years old, and 236 younger individuals from 35 and 59years old. All subjects were from Shenyang, China. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were analyzed: rs3758391 near the 5' end of the SIRT1 gene; and rs4746720, in the 3' untranslated region.    RESULTS: Differences in allele and genotype frequency were seen between the groups, with rs3758391/C more common than rs3758391/T in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.453, p=0.026), and with rs3758391/CC more common than rs3758391/CT and rs3758391/TT in the aging subjects (odds ratio=3.042, p=0.027). For the…
8880700	Aging and superoxide dismutase activity in cerebrospinal fluid.	aging	1996-09-15	We investigated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as an index of the aging process in the central nervous system (CNS). The subjects were 61 individuals aged 21-77 years, comprising 24 men and 37 women without organic disorders of the nervous system. SOD activity in CSF was measured by the nitrite method modified by Oyanagui. The results showed that SOD activity in CSF gradually increased with age and that the values of SOD activity after the fifth decade were significantly higher than those in the third and fourth decades. It might suggest that the productivity of SOD in the CNS gradually increased with age due to stimulation of various types of oxidative stress which accumulated in vivo especially after the fifth decade.
18413919	Age-related quantitative and qualitative changes in decision making ability.	aging	2008-??-??	The "frontal aging hypothesis" predicts that brain senescence affects predominantly the prefrontal regions. Preliminary evidence has recently been gathered in favour of an age-related change in a typically frontal process, i.e. decision making, using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), but overall findings have been conflicting. Following the traditional scoring method, coupled with a qualitative analysis, in the present study we compared IGT performance of 40 young (mean age: 27.9+/-4.7) and 40 old (mean age: 65.4+/-8.6) healthy adults and of 18 patients affected by frontal lobe dementia of mild severity (mean age: 65.1+/-7.4, mean MMSE score: 24.1+/-3.9). Quantitative findings support the notion that decision making ability declines with age; moreover, it approximates the impairment observed in executive dysfunction due to neurodegeneration. Results of the qualitative analysis did not reach statistical significance for the motivational and learning decision making components considered, bu…
12729587	MtDNA mutations in aging and apoptosis.	aging	2003-05-09	There is considerable evidence that the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of human mitochondria declines in various tissues with aging. However, the genetic basis of this phenomenon has not yet been clarified. The occurrence of large deletions in mtDNA from brain, skeletal, and heart muscles and other tissues of old subjects at relatively low levels has been well documented. We discuss their possible functional relevance for the aging processes. On the contrary, until very recently, only inconclusive and often discordant evidence was available for the accumulation of mtDNA point mutations in old individuals. In the past few years, however, an aging-dependent large accumulation of mtDNA point mutations has been demonstrated in the majority of individuals above a certain age. These mutations occur in the mtDNA main control region at critical sites for mtDNA replication in fibroblasts and skeletal muscles. The extraordinary tissue specificity and nucleotide selectivity of these mutations…
23366677	Fractal based complexity measure and variation in force during sustained isometric muscle contraction: effect of aging.	aging	2012-??-??	This study has investigated the effect of age on the fractal based complexity measure of muscle activity and variance in the force of isometric muscle contraction. Surface electromyogram (sEMG) and force of muscle contraction were recorded from 40 healthy subjects categorized into: Group 1: Young - age range 20-30; 10 Males and 10 Females, Group 2: Old - age range 55-70; 10 Males and 10 Females during isometric exercise at Maximum Voluntary contraction (MVC). The results show that there is a reduction in the complexity of surface electromyogram (sEMG) associated with aging. The results demonstrate that there is an increase in the coefficient of variance (CoV) of the force of muscle contraction and a decrease in complexity of sEMG for the Old age group when compared with the Young age group.
19654957	Changes of ocular version with aging in normal Korean population.	aging	2009-08-??	The purpose of this study is to estimate normative values of maximum versions in healthy Koreans and investigate age-associated changes in eye movement, using lateral and vertical version light-reflex (LVR) test. Two hundred forty normal healthy subjects whose corrected visual acuity was better than 20/50 in both eyes, from 4 to 79 yr old (30 subjects in each decade) were studied. Maximum sustained values of dextroversion, levoversion, supraversion, and infraversion in each eye were measured using LVR test. Changes of versions according to age were analyzed. Mean normal value of dextroversion, levoversion, supraversion, and infraversion in normal Koreans was 7.7 mm, 41.6 degrees, 33.9 degrees, and 7.7 mm respectively. Contrary to values of Caucasians, levoversion (adductive movement) was more excessive and infraversion (depression) was smaller in Koreans. All versions were decreased with aging (P<0.001 for all). Levoversion had the largest decrease with aging compared with other versio…
27079705	Effect of Normal Aging and of Mild Cognitive Impairment on Event-Related Potentials to a Stroop Color-Word Task.	aging	2016-??-08	Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 84 adults (51 to 87 years old) with the aim of exploring the effects of aging (middle-aged and older groups) and cognitive status (healthy or with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI) on the neural functioning associated with stimulus and response processing in a Stroop color-word task. An interference (or Stroop) effect was observed in the Reaction Time (RT), and the RT and number of errors results were consistent with the age-related decline in performance. Cognitive status did not affect the behavioral performance of the task, but age and cognitive status affected several ERP parameters. Aging was associated with a) slowing of the neural processing of the stimuli (P150, N2, and P3b latencies were longer), b) greater activation of the motor cortex for response preparation (LRP-R amplitude was larger), and c) use of more neural resources for cognitive control of stimuli (N2 amplitude was larger to the congruent and incongruent st…
18814873	Effects of aging and arm swing on the metabolic cost of stability in human walking.	aging	2008-12-05	To gain insight into the mechanical determinants of walking energetics, we investigated the effects of aging and arm swing on the metabolic cost of stabilization. We tested two hypotheses: (1) elderly adults consume more metabolic energy during walking than young adults because they consume more metabolic energy for lateral stabilization, and (2) arm swing reduces the metabolic cost of stabilization during walking in young and elderly adults. To test these hypotheses, we provided external lateral stabilization by applying bilateral forces (10% body weight) to a waist belt via elastic cords while young and elderly subjects walked at 1.3m/s on a motorized treadmill with arm swing and with no arm swing. We found that the external stabilizer reduced the net rate of metabolic energy consumption to a similar extent in elderly and young subjects. This reduction was greater (6-7%) when subjects walked with no arm swing than when they walked normally (3-4%). When young or elderly subjects elimi…
25380675	Acute exercise increases resistance to oxidative stress in young but not older adults.	aging	2014-??-??	A single bout of acute exercise increases oxidative stress and stimulates a transient increase in antioxidant enzymes. We asked whether this response would induce protection from a subsequent oxidative challenge, different from that of exercise, and whether the effects were affected by aging. We compared young (20 ± 1 years, n = 8) and older (58 ± 6 years, n = 9) healthy men and women. Resistance to oxidative stress was measured by the F2-isoprostane response to forearm ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) trial. Each participant underwent the I/R trial twice, in random order; once after performing 45 min of cycling on the preceding day (IRX) and a control trial without any physical activity (IRC). Baseline F2-isoprostane levels were significantly lower at IRX compared to IRC (P < 0.05) and not different between groups. F2-isoprostane response to IRX was significantly lower compared to IRC in young (P < 0.05) but not different in the older group. Superoxide dismutase activity in response to acut…
22692848	Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-senescence activities of a phlorotannin-rich natural extract from brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum.	aging	2012-08-??	Aging at the cellular level is characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell senescence. An extract of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum rich in phlorotannins has been studied for its inhibitory activity against oxidative stress, inflammation, and senescence. A. nodosum extract at 0.2 % prevented tBHP-induced reactive oxygen species production (evaluated using the H2DCF-DA test in cytofluorometry) in epithelial cells and LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 release (evaluated using ELISA technique) in macrophages. A. nodosum extract also increased nuclear SIRT1 activity in epithelial cells. Altogether, these beneficial cellular effects of phlorotannin-rich A. nodosum extract could be used in topical therapeutic formulations against aging.
19072252	Ascorbate recycling by erythrocytes during aging in humans.	aging	2009-02-??	Erythrocytes play a crucial role in recycling ascorbate in blood plasma. The erythrocyte ascorbate free radical (AFR) reductase is involved in the reduction of AFR to ascorbic acid (ASC) in the plasma. In the present study, we report an age-dependent increase in the activity of erythrocyte AFR reductase in humans that shows a significant positive correlation with the activity of plasma membrane redox system (PMRS). We explain the age-dependent increase in erythrocyte ASC recycling on the basis of a compensatory/protective mechanism that operates to maintain the ASC level in plasma and thereby minimize oxidative stress during aging.
19202668	Training in the aging athlete.	aging	2007-06-??	The number of healthy older individuals who are active in sports has increased significantly during the past generation. These individuals continue to perform at a high level, although there appears to be a loss in functional capacity that cannot be overcome by training. No accepted theory of aging exists, but older athletes may be limited primarily by the inability to maintain the same volume and intensity of training. Also, older athletes appear to respond more slowly to the same training load than do younger athletes. The principles of training in older athletes are similar to those in young athletes; however, additional days of recovery and cross training may be necessary to prevent orthopedic injuries. Strategies for maintaining exercise intensity, including resistance training, are advisable to prevent sarcopenia and selective loss of type II muscle fibers.
9165807	Ingredients of an old and healthy life. A centenarian perspective.	longevity	1997-06-??	This phenomenological study elicited centenarians' meanings of longevity and their perceptions of any common biological or psychosocial factors that they attributed to health and functioning. Twelve centenarians, ages 100 to 109, were interviewed. Common themes in their lived experiences included the meaning of long life, views of health, relationships with others, affirmation of worth, reasons for longevity, and God. Centenarians are long-term "survivors" with important lessons to share about high functioning, productive lives.
25217594	Newly arrived elderly immigrants: a concept analysis of "aging out of place".	aging	2015-03-??	Newcomer elderly immigrants, defined as adults older than the age of 65 who have arrived in the United States in the last 10 years, represent a growing sector of the American population. Newcomers who experience limited English proficiency, financial strain, and acculturative stress are at considerable risk of developing poor health outcomes. Nursing's focus on healthy aging and aging in place has largely ignored the experiences of these older adults, who are said to be "aging out of place." This concept analysis uses Rodgers's evolutionary method to define "aging out of place" and illustrates why existing theories of elderly migration do not necessarily apply to this population. The challenge for nurses is incorporating the family, with whom conflict may arise, into the care of these elders. Community-based strategies that enable social integration and create a greater division of labor in the care of newcomer elders are called for.
23245587	Epigenetics and aging.	longevity, aging	2013-02-??	Over the past two decades, a growing interest on the research of the biological basis of human longevity has emerged, in order to clarify the intricacy of biological and environmental factors affecting (together with stochastic factors) the quality and the rate of human aging. These researches have outlined a complex scenario in which epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and numerous histone modifications, are emerging as important factors of the overall variation in life expectancy. In fact, epigenetic marks, that are responsible of the establishment of specific expression programs and of genome stability, represent a "drawbridge" across genetic, environmental and stochastic factors. In this review we provide an overview on the current knowledge and the general features of the epigenetic modifications characterizing the aging process.
3913504	Physiology of aging.	aging	1985-02-??	Physiologic aging involves changes that tend to be linear with time and are characteristically decremental in nature. A number of the functional changes can be delayed in onset or slowed in their progress by lifestyle. Aging challenges the reserves of function that allow for activity above the resting level and for regulation of the internal environment.
1590258	Apoptosis--programmed cell death: a role in the aging process?	aging	1992-??-??	Cells continuously exposed to genotoxic agents, such as oxygen free radicals (OFRs), deeply involved in the aging process use a variety of cellular defense mechanisms. These defense mechanisms include DNA repair enzymes, antioxidants, poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (pADPRP), and stress proteins and they constitute an integrated network. An age-related failure of the efficiency of this network can affect cell proliferation and cell death, two phenomena tightly linked and regulated. Recent data from our laboratory on the role of DNA damage and pADPRP activation and on the type of cell death induced by OFRs in human lymphocytes are reviewed. In vitro and in vivo data on possible strategies to reduce oxidative stress in lymphocytes from normal and Down syndrome subjects, by using natural compounds and trace elements, are presented. They indicate that nicotinamide and L-carnitine protect human cells from OFR-induced damage and suggest that they are possible candidates as antiaging substances.
24033249	Sleep perception in non-insomniac healthy elderly: a 3-year longitudinal study.	aging	2014-02-??	OBJECTIVES: Older adults complain of sleep disturbances more often than younger adults do. It is not clear whether the age-related rise in sleep problems is related to aging itself or to health-related quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the presence of self-reported sleep problems in healthy elderly individuals and to evaluate whether changes occurred over a 3-year follow-up.    METHODS: A total of 314 older community-dwelling volunteers, aged 71.6±1.0 years old, were examined and followed for 3 years. All of the subjects completed questionnaires evaluating anxiety, depression, and sleepiness and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at the first and second evaluations. On the basis of the PSQI items, the subjects were classified as good or bad sleepers and as short, normal, or long sleepers.    RESULTS: At baseline, 53% of the subjects reported good sleep, with 61% reporting a sleep duration of approximately 7 hr. The total sleep time and the numbers of short, n…
9008663	Age differences in using a rapid step to regain balance during a forward fall.	aging	1997-01-??	BACKGROUND: Earlier studies showed that healthy old adults have substantially reduced abilities to develop joint torques rapidly. We hypothesized that this age decline would reduce abilities to regain balance once a forward fall is underway. The present study examined whether aging in fact reduces ability to regain balance by taking a single, rapid step upon release from a forward lean.    METHODS: Ten young (mean age 24.3 yr) and ten old (72.8 yr) healthy males were released from a forward-leaning position and instructed to regain standing balance by taking a single step forward. Lean angle was successively increased until a subject failed to regain balance as instructed. Lower extremity motions and foot-floor reactions were measured during the responses. Total response time was divided into reaction, weight transfer, and step times.    RESULTS: At small lean angles, responses of old subjects were similar to those of the young. However, the mean maximum lean angle from which old could…
28965790	DNA methylation age and perceived age in elderly Danish twins.	aging	2018-??-??	Perceived age is an easily accessible biomarker of aging. Here, we studied its relation to DNA methylation age (DNAm age) as introduced in (Horvath, 2013) in 180 elderly Danish twins. We found perceived age and DNAm age to be associated with chronological age (P=0.04 resp. P=2.2e-10) when correcting for gender, but did not see an association between perceived age and DNAm age (P=0.44). Intrapair-analysis showed that the proportion of pairs where the twin with the highest perceived age also had the highest DNAm age was not different from 0.5 (P=1), and we did not see a trend when dividing pairs according to their difference in perceived age (P=0.36). Hence, intrapair analysis did not reveal links between perceived age and DNAm age. Moreover, none of the 353 CpGs underlying DNAm age was individually associated with perceived age after correction for multiple-testing (P>6e-4, FDR>0.21). Finally, when constructing an epigenetic signature based on these CpGs to predict perceived age, we onl…
10936905	Regulation of energy intake in older adults: recent findings and implications.	aging	2000-??-??	Inadequate energy intake is common in older individuals and is probably the major cause of unexplained weight loss. This summary highlights recent studies on possible causes of negative energy balance in older individuals suggesting that aging is associated with a significant impairment in the regulation of food intake that inhibits appropriate short-term and long-term compensation for normal fluctuations in energy intake. The combination of a reduced ability to regulate energy intake, decreased dietary variety, and disadvantageous social factors such as functional limitations, social isolation and depression, increases the risk of negative energy balance leading to weight loss in older individuals.
19437032	Exercise-induced shear stress is associated with changes in plasma von Willebrand factor in older humans.	aging	2009-07-??	Shear stress is the frictional force of blood against the endothelium, a stimulus for endothelial activation and the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF). This study tested the hypothesis that the increase in shear stress associated with exercise correlates with plasma vWF. Young (n = 14, 25.7 +/- 5.4 years) and older (n = 13, 65.6 +/- 10.7 years) individuals participated in 30 min of dynamic handgrip exercise at a moderate intensity. Brachial artery diameter and blood flow were measured using ultrasound Doppler and blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and following 30 min of recovery from exercise with plasma levels of vWF. Plasma levels of vWF increased (P < 0.05) by 6 +/- 2% in young individuals and 4 +/- 1% in older individuals immediately after exercise. The change in plasma vWF was linearly correlated with the increase in shear stress during exercise in older individuals (post-exercise: r = 0.78, 30 min recovery: r = 0.77, P < 0.01), but no association was fo…
3771978	Aging and exocrine pancreatic function.	aging	1986-11-??	In view of the limited information concerning the influence of aging on exocrine pancreatic function, the authors undertook the present study. To examine a large number of elderly persons, including people of very advanced age (80 years and over), pancreatic function was studied by using the fluorescein dilaurate test (pancreolauryl test), one of the most recent tubeless, noninvasive pancreatic function tests. Sixty healthy noninstitutionalized elderly individuals (35 women and 25 men, aged 66 to 88 years, mean 78) participated in the study. Thirty-six healthy younger subjects (16 women and 20 men, aged 21 to 57 years, mean 36) were also studied as controls. All elderly subjects showed a strictly normal fluorescein dilaurate test. No significant differences in the pancreatic function test results were observed between the elderly under 80 years old and those over 80 years old. The authors conclude that the aging process per se does not significantly affect exocrine pancreatic function …
28051970	The Effect of Aging on the Ventilatory Response to Wearing a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Hood Respirator at Rest and During Mild Exercise.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Structural changes in the human body resulting from aging may affect the response to altered levels of O and CO. An abnormal ventilatory response to a buildup of CO in the inspired air due to rebreathing may result in adverse effects, which will impair the individual's ability to function under stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of age on the respiratory response to wearing an escape hood at rest and during mild exercise.    METHODS: Subjects were seven healthy, young adult males (20-30 years) and seven healthy, middle-aged males (45-65 years). Inspired CO and O, breathing pattern (tidal volume [V] and breathing frequency [F]), and mouth inspiratory and expiratory pressures, were measured at rest and during mild exercise (50 w) while wearing the CAPS 2000 escape hood (Shalon Chemical Industries and Supergum-Rubber and Plastic Technology, Tel Aviv, Israel).    FINDINGS: Resting inspired CO was higher in the middle-aged group compared with the young …
6395820	Selective survival, aging and society.	aging	1984-10-??	The concept of selective survival to advanced ages is introduced and discussed in relation to the black/white mortality "crossover" in the United States. Crossover refers to the phenomenon wherein black mortality rates become lower than white mortality rates after approximately age 75. This reversal of mortality rates between advantaged and disadvantaged populations also occurs between Native Americans and whites. Such crossovers have significant implications for explaining differences in patterns of aging across populations. We argue that higher rates of selective survival in disadvantaged, high mortality populations result in a greater proportion of healthy, very old people who may require less nursing-home care, who have low suicide rates, and who enjoy higher status in the family and community. Differences between populations with regard to selective survival imply that chronological age alone is not always a useful measure of aging and old age. Finally, we identify further lines o…
29144870	Brain Maturation-Differences in Biochemical Composition of Fetal and Child's Brain.	aging	2017-10-??	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in H MRS spectra of the brain of fetuses and children from 6 to 11 years of age.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 healthy fetuses in the third trimester and 22 children were examined using the proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The relative metabolite concentrations to the sum of all metabolites were calculated.    RESULTS: In the H MRS spectra of the brain from fetuses and children, there are the same characteristic peaks: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI). NAA/Σ, NAA/Cr, and Cr/Σ concentrations are significantly higher and Cho/Σ, Cho/Cr, mI/Σ, and mI/Cr are significantly lower in children than in the fetuses.    CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the brain metabolism changes from fetal life to childhood. The results of this study may provide a valuable basis for further research on brain maturation and "healthy aging."
17401138	Nonexercise movement in elderly compared with young people.	aging	2007-04-??	The association between free-living daily activity and aging is unclear because nonexercise movement and its energetic equivalent, nonexercise activity thermogenesis, have not been exhaustively studied in the elderly. We wanted to address the hypothesis that free-living nonexercise movement is lower in older individuals compared with younger controls matched for lean body mass. Ten lean, healthy, sedentary elderly and 10 young subjects matched for lean body mass underwent measurements of nonexercise movement and body posture over 10 days using sensitive, validated technology. In addition, energy expenditure was assessed using doubly labeled water and indirect calorimetry. Total nonexercise movement (acceleration arbitrary units), standing time, and standing acceleration were significantly lower in the elderly subjects; this was specifically because the elderly walked less distance per day despite having a similar number of walking bouts per day compared with the young individuals. The …
8237876	Zinc absorption in healthy elderly humans and the effect of diet.	aging	1993-11-??	Absorption of a zinc stable isotope was measured on two consecutive occasions in nine young and eight elderly healthy men aged 24-40 and 70-83 y, respectively. A zinc stable-isotope label (0.8 mg 70Zn) was added to a test meal of either high or low zinc bioavailability, depending mainly on phytic acid content. Zinc absorption from the high-bioavailability test meal was not significantly different (P > 0.05) in the young (38.9 +/- 9.8%, mean +/- SD) and elderly (35.0 +/- 10.9%) subjects. Zinc absorption from the low-bioavailability test meal was 40% and 43% lower, at 23.4 +/- 10.2% and 19.8 +/- 6.1% in these young and elderly men, respectively. Again, no significant effect of age was found. These results show that aging does not lead to nutritionally relevant changes in zinc absorption and in the effect of dietary inhibitors on zinc absorption. Thus, zinc absorption ability seems to be preserved in healthy elderly people, at least until the age of 80 y.
11976182	Replicative aging, telomeres, and oxidative stress.	aging	2002-04-??	Aging is a very complex phenomenon, both in vivo and in vitro. Free radicals and oxidative stress have been suggested for a long time to be involved in or even to be causal for the aging process. Telomeres are special structures at the end of chromosomes. They shorten during each round of replication and this has been characterized as a mitotic counting mechanism. Our experiments show that the rate of telomere shortening in vitro is modulated by oxidative stress as well as by differences in antioxidative defence capacity between cell strains. In vivo we found a strong correlation between short telomeres in blood lymphocytes and the incidence of vascular dementia. These data suggest that parameters that characterise replicative senescence in vitro offer potential for understanding of, and intervention into, the aging process in vivo.
22796505	Cognitive reserve impacts on inter-individual variability in resting-state cerebral metabolism in normal aging.	aging	2012-11-01	There is a great deal of heterogeneity in the impact of aging on cognition and cerebral functioning. One potential factor contributing to individual differences among the elderly is the cognitive reserve, which designates the partial protection from the deleterious effects of aging that lifetime experience provides. Neuroimaging studies examining task-related activation in elderly people suggested that cognitive reserve takes the form of more efficient use of brain networks and/or greater ability to recruit alternative networks to compensate for age-related cerebral changes. In this exploratory multi-center study, we examined the relationships between cognitive reserve, as measured by education and verbal intelligence, and cerebral metabolism at rest (FDG-PET) in a sample of 74 healthy older participants. Higher degree of education and verbal intelligence was associated with less metabolic activity in the right posterior temporoparietal cortex and the left anterior intraparietal sulcus…
21273405	Discrete neuroanatomical networks are associated with specific cognitive abilities in old age.	aging	2011-01-26	There have been many attempts at explaining age-related cognitive decline on the basis of regional brain changes, with the usual but inconsistent findings being that smaller gray matter volumes in certain brain regions predict worse cognitive performance in specific domains. Additionally, compromised white matter integrity, as suggested by white matter hyperintensities or decreased regional white matter fractional anisotropy, has an adverse impact on cognitive functions. The human brain is, however, a network and it may be more appropriate to relate cognitive functions to properties of the network rather than specific brain regions. We report on graph theory-based analyses of diffusion tensor imaging tract-derived connectivity in a sample of 342 healthy individuals aged 72-92 years. The cognitive domains included processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functions. We examined the association of these cognitive assessments with both the connectivity of the whole b…
6611114	The effect of normal aging on patterns of local cerebral glucose utilization.	aging	1984-??-??	When the fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) scan was applied to 40 normal volunteer subjects aged 18 to 78 years, mean local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose ( lCMRGlu ) declined with advancing age at a faster rate than was reported for mean local cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. Slopes of decline with age were similar in the centrum semiovale, caudate nucleus, putamen, and overall frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortex. Superior frontal cortex and posterior inferior frontal cortex were exceptions, undergoing more rapid metabolic decline with age than in other parts of the brain. Measurements of the rate constants for transport and phosphorylation process indicate that their change with aging had no major effect on the measurement of lCMRGlu by the 18FDG method.
18593284	L-cysteine influx in erythrocytes as a function of human age.	aging	2008-06-??	In erythrocytes, although three amino acids are required for the synthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH), the rate of GSH synthesis is determined only by the availability of L-cysteine. Cysteine supplementation has been shown to ameliorate several parameters that are known to degenerate during human aging; this has led to an interesting hypothesis that aging could be a cysteine deficiency syndrome. In the present study, we measured L-cysteine influx in human erythrocytes by suspending cells in solution containing 10 mM L-cysteine. We show a significant decline in the influx of L-cysteine in erythrocytes during aging in humans. The decrease in cysteine influx correlates with the decrease in antioxidant potential of plasma measured in terms of FRAP (ferric-reducing ability of plasma) during aging. We conclude that a decreased influx of L-cysteine may be an important factor contributing to the development of oxidative stress in human erythrocytes during aging.
1613125	Effect of aging on the pharmacokinetics of acebutolol enantiomers.	aging	1992-02-??	Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral beta-blocker that is metabolized to an equipotent chiral metabolite, diacetolol (DC). A stereoselective disposition of AC and DC enantiomers has recently been reported in young healthy subjects. As many physiologic properties affecting drug disposition are progressively altered with increasing age, the effect of aging on the pharmacokinetics of AC and DC enantiomers were investigated in nine subjects ranging from 60 to 75 years after administration of an oral 200-mg dose of racemic AC. Increasing age resulted in a significant prolongation of the elimination t1/2s of R- (r = 0.913) and S-DC (r = 0.811). Also, the S:R ratios of AC urinary excretion (sigma Xu) of enantiomers was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.677). Contribution of declining renal function to age-associated pharmacokinetics changes was subsequently examined. Renal clearance and cumulative urinary excretion of both AC and DC enantiomers were positively correlated with creatinine clearan…
16791083	Regional network of magnetic resonance imaging gray matter volume in healthy aging.	aging	2006-07-17	Healthy aging has been associated with brain volume reductions preferentially affecting the frontal cortex, but also involving other regions. We used a network model of regional covariance, the Scaled Subprofile Model, with magnetic resonance imaging voxel-based morphometry to identify the regional distribution of gray matter associated with aging in 26 healthy adults, 22-77 years old. Scaled Subprofile Model analysis identified a pattern that was highly correlated with age (R2=0.66, P<or=0.0001). Older age was associated with less gray matter in the bilateral frontal, temporal,thalamic, and right cerebellar regions. Gender differences suggested more advanced brain aging in the men. In this healthy adult sample, aging was associated with a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy most prominently involving the frontal and temporal cortices. Scaled Subprofile Model network analysis may aid in the detection and tracking of brain aging and in the evaluation of putative antiaging therapies.
10416812	Influence of aging and exercise-induced stress on human platelet function.	aging	1999-??-??	Ten healthy nonsmoking old men (age 52-70 years, OM) and ten healthy nonsmoking young men (age 20-30 years, YM) were submitted to an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer to examine the combined influence of aging and exercise-induced stress on platelet function. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA test to determine the statistical significance of differences between baseline, after exercise and after recovery values, and by Mann-Whitney test to compare differences between young and old groups. Our results show in OM at rest an increased platelet aggregability induced by the higher values of intraplatelet basal free calcium (143.3 +/- 4.8 vs. 121.5 +/- 6.0 nM, p < 0.05) and a statistically significant increase of plasma oxidative by-products evaluated as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS: 5.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 micromol/l, p < 0.05). Further, significant modifications of calcium and TBA-RS levels were found in both groups because of exercise-induced stress. The positi…
18794414	Aging of orbicularis oculi: anatomophysiologic consideration in upper blepharoplasty.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomophysiologic aging-related changes in the orbicularis oculi muscle.    METHODS: We examined the full-thickness histologic characteristics of the upper eyelids from cadavers of 30-, 40-, 60-, and 70-year-old men and the muscle interference pattern (IP) of 68 healthy volunteers of both sexes aged 18 to 73 years.    RESULTS: Histologic analysis revealed that in the aging upper eyelid, changes were primarily in the skin and subcutaneous layers with the characteristic loss of collagen elastic fibers; however, the whole muscle layer was histologically intact, with no signs of aging; loss of fibers, loss of adherence to surrounding structure, or ptosis. Neurophysiologic studies of the electromyographic IP of the orbicularis oculi muscle confirmed that the full efficiency of orbicularis oculi function was intact in the age group studied (18-73 years) in both sexes.    CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the anatomophysiologic characteristics of the orbicula…
19356871	Age- and sex-related changes in the normal human ear.	aging	2009-05-30	The objective of this study was to supply information about: (1) normal sex-related dimensions of ears (linear distances and ratios, area); (2) left-right symmetry; and (3) growth changes between childhood and old age. The three-dimensional coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the ears and face were obtained by a non-invasive, computerized electromagnetic digitizer in 497 male and 346 female healthy subjects aged 4-73 years. From the landmarks, paired ear width and length, the relevant ratios, ear areas and angles relative to the facial midline, as well as indices of left-right symmetry, were calculated, and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. All ear dimensions were significantly larger in men than in women (p<0.001). A significant effect of age was found (p<0.001), with larger values in older individuals. The ear width-to-length ratio and the sagittal angle of the auricle significantly decreased as a function of age (p<0.…
25213483	Successful Aging Among LGBT Older Adults: Physical and Mental Health-Related Quality of Life by Age Group.	aging	2015-02-??	PURPOSE: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are a health disparate population as identified in Healthy People 2020. Yet, there has been limited attention to how LGBT older adults maintain successful aging despite the adversity they face. Utilizing a Resilience Framework, this study investigates the relationship between physical and mental health-related quality of life (QOL) and covariates by age group.    DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of LGBT adults aged 50 and older (N = 2,560) was conducted by Caring and Aging with Pride: The National Health, Aging, and Sexuality Study via collaborations with 11 sites across the U.S. Linear regression analyses tested specified relationships and moderating effects of age groups (aged 50-64; 65-79; 80 and older).    RESULTS: Physical and mental health QOL were negatively associated with discrimination and chronic conditions and positively with social support, social network size, physical and leisure activities, subst…
24655672	Permanent personhood or meaningful decline? Toward a critical anthropology of successful aging.	aging	2014-04-??	The current North American successful aging movement offers a particular normative model of how to age well, one tied to specific notions of individualist personhood especially valued in North America emphasizing independence, productivity, self-maintenance, and the individual self as project. This successful aging paradigm, with its various incarnations as active, healthy and productive aging, has received little scrutiny as to its cultural assumptions. Drawing on fieldwork data with elders from both India and the United States, this article offers an analysis of cultural assumptions underlying the North American successful aging paradigm as represented in prevailing popular and scientific discourse on how to age well. Four key themes in this public successful aging discourse are examined: individual agency and control; maintaining productive activity; the value of independence and importance of avoiding dependence; and permanent personhood, a vision of the ideal person as not really …
20974705	Age differences in implicit learning of probabilistic unstructured sequences.	aging	2011-01-??	OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether implicit probabilistic learning, the acquisition of regularities without intent or explicit knowledge, declines with healthy aging.    METHODS: Because age differences in previous work might reflect motor or rule learning deficits, we used the implicit Triplets Learning Task with reduced motor sequencing and non-rule-based associations. Fifteen young and 15 old adults responded only to the last event in a series of discrete 3-event sequences or triplets. A randomly chosen set of triplets occurred with high frequency, so there was no underlying rule to be learned.    RESULTS: Both age groups learned associative regularities, but age differences in favor of the young emerged with practice. Discussion. Age differences may reflect the different neural regions that are involved as training progresses, which differ in the extent to which they are compromised by aging.
19707011	Egomotion and vection in young and elderly adults.	aging	2009-??-??	BACKGROUND: Elderly people tend to rely upon their visual input more than upon that from other sensory systems due to age-related declines. This reliance upon vision places older adults at risk for falls because they are often not aware of the magnitude of their body motion.    OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the influence of stationary anchors and vection upon egomotion in young, young-old and old adult age groups using the moving room paradigm.    METHODS: Forty-five healthy participants separated into 3 age groups (young, 18-20 years; young-old, 60-69 years; old, 70-79 years) were tested. Participants stood on a force platform in front of an oscillating virtual moving room. Optical flow fields were presented to the central and peripheral areas of the retina, individually and jointly. Postural motion was assessed through center of pressure (COP). There were 5 room conditions used to evaluate the role of central and peripheral vision upon postural mot…
22189624	Subjective well-being amongst community-dwelling elders: what determines satisfaction with life? Findings from the Dublin Healthy Aging Study.	aging	2012-02-??	BACKGROUND: Life satisfaction is a subjective expression of well-being and successful aging. Subjective well-being is a major determinant of health outcomes in older people. The aim of this study was to determine which factors predicted well-being in older people living in the community as measured by their satisfaction with life.    METHODS: The relationship between life satisfaction, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI-A) and physical, cognitive and demographic variables was examined in 466 older people living in the community using a stepwise regression model.    RESULTS: Depression, loneliness, neuroticism, extraversion, recent participation in physical activity, age and self-reported exhaustion, were the independent predictors of life satisfaction in our elderly cohort.    CONCLUSION: Subjective well-being, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Scale, is predicted by depression, loneliness, personality traits, recent participation in physical activity and self-reported …
20826915	Plasma protein oxidation and its correlation with antioxidant potential during human aging.	aging	2010-??-??	Previous studies have indicated that the main molecular characteristic of aging is the progressive accumulation of oxidative damages in cellular macromolecules. Proteins are one of the main molecular targets of age-related oxidative stress, which have been observed during aging process in cellular systems.. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidation of amino acid side chains, formation of protein-protein cross-linkages, and oxidation of the peptide backbones. In the present study, we report the age-dependent oxidative alterations in biomarkers of plasma protein oxidation: protein carbonyls (PCO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and plasma total thiol groups (T-SH) in the Indian population and also correlate these parameters with total plasma antioxidant potential. We show an age dependent decrease in T-SH levels and increase in PCO and AOPPs level. The alterations in the levels of these parameters correlated significantly with the total antioxidant capacity of the …
11204226	Quantification of urine 17-ketosteroid sulfates and glucuronides by high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectroscopy.	aging	2001-01-05	The measurement of androgen steroids has been utilized as a clinical indicator of adrenal function, androgen abuse, and as a prediction of general health or biological aging. An improved high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectroscopic method with sonic spray ionization (SSI) technology for the quantification of individual urinary 17-ketosteroid sulfates and glucuronides was developed and validated. Sample preparation was simplified using a C18 cartridge followed by direct injection onto a reversed-phase HPLC column. Individual 17-ketosteroid from 63 urinary specimens collected in a 24-h period was measured. 17-Ketosteroid conjugates, total 17-KS-S and the ratio of total 17-KS-S to creatinine referred to herein as the Anabolic/Catabolic Index (ACI) showed statistically significant negative correlations with age.
3574049	Human rights and the older worker: changes in work capacity with age.	aging	1987-04-??	The aging of physical working capacity affects the employability of older individuals in heavy work through such factors as a decline in aerobic power, muscular strength, and tolerance of thermal load. Difficulties in setting an appropriate criterion for enforced retirement include, on the one hand, a tremendous inter-individual variation in the rate of aging, and on the other, the problem that a standard appropriate for older men cannot be met by even the youngest women. Vigorous training can reduce some components of biological age by as much as 20 yr, and it is manifestly unfair to require the retirement of those employees who have chosen a lifestyle that has conserved their physical condition. However, the development of reliable, valid, and convincing tests that will distinguish such individuals remains a fascinating medico-legal challenge.
28230292	Age-related changes in pain sensitivity in healthy humans: A systematic review with meta-analysis.	lifespan	2017-??-??	Literature suggests that pain perception diminishes in old age. The most recent review used search strategies conducted over a decade ago and concluded that study findings were equivocal. The aim of this systematic review, with meta-analysis, was to determine age-related changes in pain sensitivity in healthy pain-free adults, children and adolescents. A search of PubMed, Science Direct, and PsycINFO identified studies that compared pain sensitivity response to noxious stimuli at different time points in the lifespan of healthy individuals. Selected studies were assessed for methodological quality and data pooled and meta-analysed. Publication bias was tested using Funnel plots. Twelve studies were included in the review (study sample sizes 30-244 participants). Seven of nine studies found statistically significant differences in pain sensitivity response between old (mean ± SD 62.2 ± 3.4 to 79 ± 4 years) and younger adults (22 ± 1.5 to 39.1 ± 8.8 years), but the direction of change wa…
7493200	Effects of aging on energy requirements and the control of food intake in men.	aging	1995-11-??	Inadequate energy intake can be an important contributor to sarcopenia in older individuals, because negative energy balance induces negative nitrogen balance, independent of nitrogen intake. This review highlights recent studies from our laboratory on possible causes of negative energy balance in older individuals. Studies of energy requirements determined by measurement of total energy expenditure during weight maintenance, using the doubly labeled water technique, and the control of food intake following overeating and undereating indicate (a) that older individuals have higher energy requirements than anticipated, based on current Recommended Dietary Allowances for energy, and (b) that aging is associated with a significant impairment in the control of food intake, which inhibits appropriate compensation for prior changes in energy intake. The combination of unexpectedly high energy needs, and an inability to accurately control energy intake, increases the risk for negative energy …
21187579	Age-related carbonyl stress and erythrocyte membrane protein carbonylation.	aging	2010-??-??	Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) have been widely used as indicators of oxidative stress. However, the associations of carbonyl stress with aging process and biochemical alteration of erythrocyte are still poorly understood. Fresh blood samples in vacutainer tubes containing sodium heparinate were obtained from 874 volunteers who were divided into young, adult and old groups based on their age. Plasma RCS and thiols concentrations between different age groups and erythrocyte membrane protein carbonylation in the adult group were detected within 24h of the blood sampling. Results showed that the plasma thiols concentration decreased gradually during aging process, and the p-values between all three groups are less than 0.05. The plasma RCS concentration in different age groups showed a nonlinear association with age. The levels in the young group were slightly higher than the adult group (not significant) and lower than the old group (p < 0.01). The protein carbonylation of erythrocyte m…
23526628	Social engagement and health in younger, older, and oldest-old adults in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study.	aging	2013-02-??	Social support has been shown to influence health outcomes in later life. In this study, we focus on social engagement as an umbrella construct that covers select social behaviors in a life span sample that included oldest-old adults, a segment of the adult population for whom very little data currently exist. We examined relationships among social engagement, positive health behaviors, and physical health to provide new evidence that addresses gaps in the extant literature concerning social engagement and healthy aging in very old adults. Participants were younger (21-59 years), older (60-89 years), and oldest-old (90-97 years) adults (N = 364) in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study (LHAS). Linear regression analyses indicated that age, gender, and hours spent outside of the house were significantly associated with self-reported health. The number of clubs and hours outside of home were more important factors in the analyses of objective health status than positive health behaviors, aft…
8307869	Muscle metabolism during exercise in young and older untrained and endurance-trained men.	aging	1993-11-??	To examine effects of aging and endurance training on human muscle metabolism during exercise, 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the metabolic response to exercise in young (21-33 yr) and older (58-68 yr) untrained and endurance-trained men (n = 6/group). Subjects performed graded plantar flexion exercise with the right leg, with metabolic responses measured using a 31P surface coil placed over the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle biopsy samples were also obtained for determination of citrate synthase activity. Rate of increase in P(i)-to-phosphocreatine ratio with increasing power output was greater (P < 0.01) in older untrained [0.058 +/- 0.022 (SD) W-1] and trained men (0.042 +/- 0.010 W-1) than in young untrained (0.038 +/- 0.017 W-1) and trained men (0.024 +/- 0.010 W-1). Plantar flexor muscle cross-sectional area and volume (determined using 1H magnetic resonance imaging) were 11-12% (P < 0.05) and 16-18% (P < 0.01) smaller, respectively, in ol…
19377015	Multiparametric NMR-based assessment of skeletal muscle perfusion and metabolism during exercise in elderly persons: preliminary findings.	aging	2009-09-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with a decline in exercise capacity that may be attributable to maladaptations in both skeletal muscle perfusion and metabolism; yet very little is known regarding the real-time, within-muscle interplay between these parameters during physical activity. Therefore, we utilized an unique nuclear magnetic resonance sequence to concomitantly examine changes in lower leg skeletal muscle perfusion and metabolism.    METHODS: In young (26+/-5 years, n=6) and older (70+/-5 years, n=6) healthy volunteers, arterial spin labeling measurements of muscle perfusion were combined with 31 Phosphorous (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor high-energy phosphate metabolites during and after 5 minutes of moderate-intensity (approximately 5W) plantar flexion exercise.    RESULTS: Compared with young, end-exercise perfusion was diminished in older participants (43+/-10 mL/100 g/minute, old; 60+/-7 mL/100 g.minute, young), accompanied by greater phosphocreat…
8733112	CD45 isoforms expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells throughout life, from newborns to centenarians: implications for T cell memory.	lifespan	1996-03-29	CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T lymphocytes show mutually exclusive expression of CD45RA or CD45R0, two isoforms of the common leukocyte antigen that seem to recognize so-called virgin/unprimed and memory/activated T cells. The expression of these isoforms has been studied by three colour cytofluorimetric analysis on CD4+ or CD8+ peripheral blood CD3+ cells from 22 healthy centenarians, analyzed in a context of 202 healthy donors 0-110 years old. An age-related unbalance of virgin and memory cells was found between CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. As expected, at birgh 95-99% of the CD3+ lymphocytes expressed the CD45RA isoform. A rapid increase of CD45R0+ cells was observed in the first 2-3 decades of life, this phenomenon being much more pronounced on CD4+ cells. Subsequently, the increase of the 'memory' compartment was much less rapid, so that in centenarians a consistent reservoire of CD45RA+ among CD4+ cells was still present (about 20%). In these exceptional individuals the percentage of…
24063536	Increased telomere length and proliferative potential in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adults of different ages stimulated with concanavalin A.	aging	2013-09-24	BACKGROUND: Recently, a direct correlation with telomere length, proliferative potential and telomerase activity has been found in the process of aging in peripheral blood cells. The objective of the study was to evaluate telomere length and proliferative potential in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after stimulation with Concanavalin A (ConA) of young adults compared with older adults.    METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 20 healthy young males (20-25 years old) (group Y) and 20 males (60-65 years old) (group O). We compared PBMC proliferation before and after stimulation with ConA. DNA was isolated from cells separated before and after culture with ConA for telomeric measurement by real-time polymerase chain reaction.    RESULTS: In vitro stimulation of PBMCs from young subjects induced an increase of telomere length as well as a higher replicative capacity of cell proliferation. Samples from older adults showed higher loss of telomeric DNA (p = 0.03) and higher le…
24122515	The importance of optimism in maintaining healthy aging in rural Alaska.	aging	2013-11-??	Many Alaska Native Elders attended government-run boarding schools as children, were forbidden to speak their native language, and were forced to abandon their traditional subsistence lifestyle, yet they maintained an optimistic outlook on life and continued to age well. The Explanatory Model Interview Protocol was adapted to interview a purposive sample of Alaska Native Elders (n = 26) and grounded theory was used to develop a model of successful aging for Alaska Native Elders in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The theme of optimism was significant in the findings and was also found in each of the elements of successful aging, which were spirituality, emotional well-being, community engagement, and physical health. These four elements served as the foundation of the Model of Successful Aging. The Elders believed they were able to age successfully because they continued to be optimistic despite the challenges they faced (and are currently facing) in their communities.
1558697	Personal goals of older adults: issues in assessment and prediction.	aging	1992-03-??	This study identifies dimensions of individual difference in the content of older adults' personal goals and examines demographic, loss-related, and contextual influences on these goals. Results are based on the responses of 179 elders to a 112-item inventory designed to tap achievement, maintenance, disengagement, and coping goals in 16 life domains. Factor analyses yielded 10 dimensions that describe themes of global motivation, concerns about support and desired pace, and complexity of life. Demographic disadvantages and age-related transitions were related to greater desire for disengagement, support, and stability. Elders who were married and healthy were more likely to report a desire for an energetic life-style. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future research on elders' goals as a context for understanding the meaning of self-evaluation and environmental influences on aging.
2295771	Nonenzymatic glycosylation of protein does not increase with age in normal human lenses.	aging	1990-01-??	Nonenzymatic glycosylation or glycation is a posttranslational modification of proteins which has been implicated in the aging of lens proteins and the development of senile and diabetic cataracts. The extent of glycation of normal human lens proteins was measured by reduction of the protein with [3H]NaBH4, acid hydrolysis and quantitation of radioactive hexitol-amino acids by phenylboronic acid (PBA) affinity chromatography. Hexitollysine (HL) accounted for greater than or equal to 90% of total radioactivity recovered as hexitol-amino acids (HAA). In lenses in the age range (1-79) years (n = 26) there was no significant age-dependent increase in glycation of lens proteins (p greater than .10). The average extent of glycation was 2.3 +/- 0.3 mmol glycated lysine/mol lysine, or approximately 0.8 nmol hexitollysine/mg lens protein. These results indicate that the extent of glycation of lysine residues in lens proteins is comparable to that of lysine residues in soluble proteins, such as …
24683508	Unilateral disruptions in the default network with aging in native space.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: Disruption of the default-mode network (DMN) in healthy elders has been reported in many studies.    METHODS: In a group of 51 participants (25 young, 26 elder) we examined DMN connectivity in subjects' native space. In the native space method, subject-specific regional masks (obtained independently for each subject) are used to extract regional fMRI times series. This approach substitutes the spatial normalization and subsequent smoothing used in prevailing methods, affords more accurate spatial localization, and provides the power to examine connectivity separately in the two hemispheres instead of averaging regions across hemispheres.    RESULTS: The native space method yielded new findings which were not detectable by the prevailing methods. The most reliable and robust disruption in elders' DMN connectivity were found between supramarginal gyrus and superior-frontal cortex in the right hemisphere only. The mean correlation between these two regions in young participant…
11909891	Effects of age, step direction, and reaction condition on the ability to step quickly.	aging	2002-04-??	BACKGROUND: The ability to take a step quickly is important for balance maintenance during activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age, reaction condition, and step direction on the ability to take a volitional step as fast as possible.    METHODS: The performance of a voluntary step task was measured in young adult (mean age 20, SD 0.9 years), young-old adult (mean age 67, SD 3.7 years), and old adult (mean age 78, SD 2.3 years) healthy female participants. Each participant stepped as fast as possible in eight directions in response to a visual cue in a simple or choice reaction time condition. The effects of age, reaction condition, and step direction and their interactions on the primary outcome variables of response time, step liftoff, and step landing time were examined.    RESULTS: The normal aging process progressively increased the response, liftoff, and landing times. The choice reaction time condition, compared to the simple, ha…
10919955	The aging process as a modifier of metabolism.	aging	2000-??-??	Because elderly adults have distinct metabolic characteristics that alter various nutrient requirements, simple extrapolations of nutrient requirements for younger adults are not warranted. Gastrointestinal function is well preserved with aging regarding the digestion and absorption of macronutrients, but the aging gastrointestinal tract becomes less efficient in absorbing vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and calcium. The new dietary reference intakes considered recent studies in aging adults and concluded that the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) should be 1200 mg and 15 microg for calcium and vitamin D, respectively, for persons over the age of 70 y. The new RDAs for riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 are not different for persons in the oldest age category (>70 y) than for those aged 51-70 y. Because this is a quickly advancing field, it will be important to closely follow new research on nutrient requirements and aging over the next several years.
22732185	Protein thiolation index (PTI) as a biomarker of oxidative stress.	aging	2012-08-15	Several biomarkers of oxidative stress have been proposed and used in clinical research but so far unreliable or, at least, controversial results have been obtained. Given the high susceptibility of sulfhydryl groups to oxidation, we here suggest the use of a protein thiolation index (PTI), i.e., the molar ratio between the sum of all low molecular mass thiols bound to plasma proteins (forming, as a whole, S-thiolated proteins) and protein free cysteinyl residues, as a suitable biomarker of oxidative stress. While titration of free thiols can be performed by a simple spectrophotometric procedure, accurate quantification of S-thiolated proteins is problematic and current methods require, in most cases, application of time-consuming chromatographic techniques, making their application to large-scale clinical studies difficult. Here we report a new spectrophotometric method which relies on the specific determination of low molecular mass thiols released from S-thiolated proteins after dit…
8438777	Day-to-day variation in iron-status indexes in elderly women.	aging	1993-03-??	Day-to-day variability in biochemical indicators of iron status in well-hydrated and healthy women 70-79 y old (n = 10) was determined. Venous blood was collected on 4 nonconsecutive days during a 2-wk period. Analytical (sigma 2 rep) and biological (sigma 2 fd) variance components were computed based on a previously established scheme in younger adults. These two variance components were summed to obtain the total day-to-day variability (sigma 2 fd). Our results indicate that biological variation contributed most to the intraindividual variation. We calculated that sampling once for most iron indexes and twice for plasma transferrin receptors in elderly individuals is adequate to accurately determine these indexes whereas serum iron and transferrin saturation, indexes with high CVfd, require seven and eight measurements, respectively. These data, compared with previously published data in younger adults, demonstrate that aging is associated with a decreased variation in some indexes o…
1529275	The patterns of motility are maintained in the human small intestine throughout the process of aging.	aging	1992-05-??	Intestinal disorders suggesting impaired gastrointestinal motility due to aging have been reported, but the influence of advanced age on the patterns of motility in the human small intestine is unknown. The present prospective study describes these patterns of motility in 15 healthy old subjects with a median of 84 years (range, 81-91 years). Nineteen healthy young adults served as controls. Ambulatory manometry was performed at home, with two sensors located in the proximal small intestine. Postprandial motility was induced by a standardized meal at 1800 h, and fasting motility was recorded during the subsequent night. Migrating motor complex (MMC) data were analysed by means of an expanded variance component model. Recurrent MMCs were identified during fasting in all individuals, with similar periodicity in old and young adults (p = 0.4). The propagation velocity of phase III of MMC was slower in the old subjects (6.5 +/- 0.8 cm/min versus 10.8 +/- 1.2 cm/min; p less than 0.01). Dura…
25080128	Oxidative stress and aging: a non-invasive EPR investigation in human volunteers.	aging	2015-04-??	The oxidative stress theory of aging has brought to the implicit expectation that oxidative stress increases with aging. Unfortunately, a broad investigation in humans is missing due to limitations of conventional oxidative stress status (OSS) analyses. Here we show that the OSS measured in peripheral blood of 247 healthy volunteers, aged 2 days-104 years, using the electron paramagnetic resonance "EPR-radical probe" technique, negatively correlated with age (-1.1 %/year; p < 0.0001) both by simple and multiple linear regression analyses and that it was only marginally affected by sex. These findings stimulate further mechanistic studies.
20656622	Fatigue and fatigability in older adults.	lifespan, aging	2010-05-??	Fatigue is believed to be a common complaint among older adults; however, multiple studies of self-reported fatigue across the lifespan have found this may not be the case. To explain this paradox, this article considers "fatigability"-a phenotype characterized by the relationship between an individual's perceived fatigue and the activity level with which the fatigue is associated. Fatigability may be measured by combining self-report measures of fatigue with performance of physical or cognitive activities, provided that the work of the activity is known or can be standardized. Doing so prevents self-pacing and allows meaningful comparisons across subjects and between studies. Increased fatigability with aging may arise from a variety of factors including age-related changes in energy production or utilization, and inflammatory mechanisms. A few published intervention studies have targeted fatigue in older adults, though none have examined fatigability specifically. Because fatigue may…
27206842	Executive function subcomponents and their relations to everyday functioning in healthy older adults.	aging	2016-??-??	Everyday functioning and its executive functioning cognitive correlates (i.e., switching, inhibition, and updating) were investigated in healthy older adults (HOAs) using multiple methods of functional status. In addition to whether computerized experimental tasks would better dissociate these subcomponents than neuropsychological measures of executive functioning, we were also interested in the contributions of both experimental and neuropsychological measures of executive function subcomponents to functional abilities. Seventy HOAs (45 young-old and 25 old-old) and 70 younger adults completed executive function and neuropsychological tests. In addition to self- and informant questionnaires of functional abilities, HOAs completed two performance-based measures. An aging effect was found on all executive function measures. Old-old older adults and their informants did not report more functional difficulties but demonstrated more difficulties on performance-based measures than did young…
10876079	I2-Imidazoline receptors and monoamine oxidase B enzyme sites in human brain: covariation with age.	aging	2000-07-14	An association between monoamino oxidase B enzyme (MAO-B) sites and I(2)-imidazoline receptors (I(2)-IR) has been established in human brain on the basis of correlational studies of radiolabelled binding sites. Because both MAO-B and I(2)-IR densities increase with aging, the age at death could be partially involved in the observed correlations. The evaluation of two independent but similar datasets demonstrated that the linear correlation between MAO-B and I(2)-IR densities dropped from 0.70 (P=0.02) and 0.41 (P=0.14) in the crude analyses to the negligible values of 0.07 (P=0.84) and 0.09 (P=0.75) when the age at death was controlled for in the statistical analyses. The results lead to conclude, contrary to former interpretations, that there is not any statistical association linking both MAO-B catalytic unit sites and I(2)-IR densities in the human brain.
7916940	Age-related differences in visual search task performance: relative stability of parallel but not serial search.	aging	????-??-??	The hypothesis that visual search tasks requiring effortful, serial processing are more sensitive to aging than those requiring relatively automatic, parallel processing was tested in 96 healthy adults who performed parallel and serial visual search tasks with fixed presentation times. Reaction times and error rates increased with age in both tasks, but there was no difference between young and old in the effect of increasing numbers of distractors on reaction times. However, the older subjects made significantly more errors with increasing numbers of distractors in the serial search task. Older subjects have disproportionately more difficulty performing serial compared to parallel visual search tasks than do younger subjects. Additionally, this difference is not caused solely by cautious response strategies in the elders.
15345728	Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-measured lean soft tissue mass: differing relation to body cell mass across the adult life span.	aging	2004-08-??	Lean soft tissue (LST) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used as a metabolic measure in aging research despite evidence of extracellular fluid expansion and a corresponding reduction in body cell mass (BCM) in older participants. We investigated the hypothesis that the fraction of LST as BCM is smaller with greater age. Men and women (n = 2043) had DEXA and 40K-counting for body potassium and BCM measured on the same day. Both BCM and LST were lower with greater age but the relative lowering was larger for BCM. A multiple linear regression model was fitted with BCM/LST as the dependent variable, and age, sex, and interaction terms as independent variables. Men had a mean BCM/LST greater (p < .001) than women; quadratic and cubic age terms were also significant or approached significance. Thus, the fraction of LST as BCM is smaller in older adults, a finding that has implications for the interpretation of DEXA results.
22614192	Endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone and radioactive iodine uptake in normal subjects.	aging	2012-06-??	In 105 normal volunteers, 52 male and 53 female, mean age 45 (range, 20-68), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (1.46 ± 0.7; range, 0.43-3.87 microUI/mL) and 24-hour thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) (16.15% ± 4.78% range, 6.45%-30.08%) were measured. Additionally, TSH was 1.18 ± 0.5 microUI/mL for 20 to 29 year-olds and 1.59 ± 0.9 microUI/mL for 60 to 68 year old (P = 0.037). RAIU was 18.30 ± 4.5 for 20 to 29-year-olds and 14.92 ± 3.1 for 60 to 68 year-olds (P = 0.009). TSH trends positively and RAIU at 24 hours correlates negatively with aging of the pituitary axis.
26468987	Effect of aging on the microstructure, hardness and chemical composition of dentin.	aging	2015-12-??	OBJECTIVE: Understanding the effects of biological aging on human tissues has been a topic of extensive research. With the increase in healthy seniors and quality of life that topic is becoming increasingly important. In this investigation the effects of aging on the microstructure, chemical composition and hardness of human coronal dentin was studied from a comparison of teeth within "young" and "old" age groups.    METHODS: The microstructure of dentin within three regions (i.e., inner, middle and outer) was analyzed using electron and optical microscopy. The mineral-to-collagen ratio in these three regions was estimated using Raman spectroscopy and the hardness was evaluated using microindentation.    RESULTS: Results showed that there were significant differences in tubule density, tubule diameter and peritubular cuff diameter with depth. Although there was no difference in tubule density and diameter of the tubules between the age groups, there was a significant difference in the …
22063904	Both left and right posterior parietal activations contribute to compensatory processes in normal aging.	aging	2012-01-??	Older adults often exhibit greater brain activation in prefrontal cortex compared to younger adults, and there is some evidence that this increased activation compensates for age-related neural degradation that would otherwise adversely affect cognitive performance. Less is known about aging and compensatory recruitment in the parietal cortex. In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we presented healthy young and old participants with two Stroop-like tasks (number magnitude and physical size). In young, the number magnitude task activated right parietal cortex and the physical size task activated left parietal cortex. In older adults, we observed contralateral parietal recruitment that depended on the task: in the number magnitude task older participants recruited left posterior parietal cortex (in addition to the right parietal activity observed in young) while in the physical size task they recruited right (in addition to left) posterior parietal cortex. In…
8366263	Cortisol production rate and the urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, free cortisol, and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol in healthy elderly men and women.	aging	1993-09-??	BACKGROUND: Although many workers have tested adrenal function in the elderly, few have studied the effect of aging on cortisol production rate or urinary free cortisol or 6 beta-hydroxycortisol excretion, and none have published comparisons of these variables between old people of defined health status and young people.    METHODS: We have measured cortisol production rate and the urinary excretion of free cortisol, 6 beta-hydroxycortisol, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (Porter-Silber chromogens) and creatinine in elderly men and women screened by the SENIEUR protocol and in young men; 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol excretion were also measured in young women. The period of measurement was 24 h or, usually, 48 h.    RESULTS: Only 6 beta-hydroxycortisol excretion was affected by aging; it was lower in the elderly men and women than in their younger counterparts. Urinary free cortisol excretion was lower in the elderly women than in the elderly men. There were no signifi…
15494736	Lower resting metabolic rate in the elderly may not be entirely due to changes in body composition.	aging	2005-02-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether or not the lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) in the elderly is entirely due to changes in body composition.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional data of 132 female (age 69.9+/-5.5 y, body mass index (BMI) 26.5+/-4.0 kg/m(2)) and 84 male (age 68.9+/-5.1 y, BMI 26.1+/-2.8 kg/m(2)) participants of the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population of Giessen, Germany, as well as that of 159 young women (age 24.8+/-3.0 y, BMI 21.1+/-2.5 kg/m(2)) and 67 young men (age 26.8+/-3.4 y, BMI 23.3+/-2.4 kg/m(2)) were analysed. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry after an overnight fast and body composition was estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis and predictive equations from the literature. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust RMR for body composition, body fat distribution and smoking habits. Additionally, RMR that is to be expected theoretically, was calculated on the basis of the subjects' body composition and the specific m…
15981793	Categorical perception of faces and facial expressions: the age factor.	aging	????-??-??	Effects of normal aging on categorical perception (CP) of facial identities and facial emotional expressions were investigated. The stimuli were morphs of three identities and of three expressions. In Experiment 1, 38 healthy participants (22 to 79 years old; three age groups) had to identify morphed identities (three continua) and expressions (three continua) varying with respect to their distance from the original photographs. This experiment allowed the computation of the boundary between categories (expressions and identities). The results showed that the locus of this boundary was not affected by age (except for the continuum disgust-happiness), but that the rate of intrusions and latencies of responses increased with age. In addition, CP was suggested, as latencies increased as a function of the distance between the displayed morph and the original, unmorphed photograph. CP predicts an easier discrimination of two morphs located on both sides of the boundary than discrimination o…
23218565	Age dependence of hemodynamic response characteristics in human functional magnetic resonance imaging.	lifespan, aging	2013-05-??	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of cognitive aging have generally compared the amplitude and extent of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal increases evoked by a task in older and younger groups. BOLD is thus used as a direct index of neuronal activation and it is assumed that the relationship between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response is unchanged across the lifespan. However, even in healthy aging, differences in vascular and metabolic function have been observed that could affect the coupling between neuronal activity and the BOLD signal. Here we use a calibrated fMRI method to explore vascular and metabolic changes that might bias such BOLD comparisons. Though BOLD signal changes evoked by a cognitive task were found to be similar between a group of younger and older adults (e.g., 0.50 ± 0.04% vs. 0.50 ± 0.05% in right frontal areas), comparison of BOLD and arterial spin labelling (ASL) responses elicited in the same set of structures by a con…
15018610	Senescence-associated changes in respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in primary human fibroblasts.	lifespan	2004-06-15	Limitation of lifespan in replicative senescence is related to oxidative stress, which is probably both the cause and consequence of impaired mitochondrial respiratory function. The respiration of senescent human diploid fibroblasts was analysed by high-resolution respirometry. To rule out cell-cycle effects, proliferating and growth-arrested young fibroblasts were used as controls. Uncoupled respiration, as normalized to citrate synthase activity, remained unchanged, reflecting a constant capacity of the respiratory chain. Oligomycin-inhibited respiration, however, was significantly increased in mitochondria of senescent cells, indicating a lower coupling of electron transport with phosphorylation. In contrast, growth-arrested young fibroblasts exhibited a higher coupling state compared with proliferating controls. In intact cells, partial uncoupling may lead to either decreased oxidative ATP production or a compensatory increase in routine respiration. To distinguish between these al…
2460518	Aging and cerebral amyloid: early detection of amyloid in the human brain using biochemical extraction and immunostain.	aging	1988-11-??	To search for relationships between aging and cerebral amyloid, the brains of 66 clinically nondemented individuals were investigated, using the following three approaches for verification of the amyloid: Congo red staining as a histochemical method; immunostaining using anti-beta protein antiserum as an immunohistochemical identification; and biochemical extraction of amyloid from nonfixed brain tissues. That the incidence of cerebral amyloid increased with aging was determined using all three approaches. Immunostaining using anti-beta protein antiserum was more sensitive than Congo red staining. The biochemical extraction was most sensitive for detection of amyloid, and revealed that amyloid was extracted initially from more than half (67%) of the brains of 9 persons in their 50s and from almost all (97%) brains of 35 persons over 60 years of age. Amyloid was extracted even from brains in which amyloid deposits were not detected by histochemical or immunohistochemical methods. This r…
19299836	Accelerometer assessment of physical activity in active, healthy older adults.	aging	2009-01-??	Despite widespread use of accelerometers to objectively monitor physical activity among adults and youth, little attention has been given to older populations. The purpose of this study was to define an accelerometer-count cut point for a group of older adults and to then assess the group's physical activity for 7 days. Participants (N = 38, age 69.7 +/- 3.5 yr) completed a laboratory-based calibration with an Actigraph 7164 accelerometer. The cut point defining moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 1,041 counts/min. On average, participants obtained 68 min of MVPA per day, although more than 65% of this occurred as sporadic activity. Longer bouts of activity occurred in the morning (6 a.m. to 12 p.m.) more frequently than other times of the day. Almost 14 hr/day were spent in light-intensity activity. This study demonstrates the rich information that accelerometers provide about older adult activity patterns-information that might further our understanding of the relations…
26913518	Programmed Cell Death Genes Are Linked to Elevated Creatine Kinase Levels in Unhealthy Male Nonagenarians.	longevity, aging	2016-??-??	Declining health in the oldest-old takes an energy toll for the simple maintenance of body functions. The underlying mechanisms, however, differ in males and females. In females, the declines are explained by loss of muscle mass; but this is not the case in males, in whom they are associated with increased levels of circulating creatine kinase. This relationship raises the possibility that muscle damage rather than muscle loss is the cause of the increased energy demands of unhealthy aging in males. We have now examined factors that contribute to the increase in creatine kinase. Much of it (60%) can be explained by a history of cardiac problems and lower kidney function, while being mitigated by moderate physical activity, reinforcing the notion that tissue damage is a likely source. In a search for genetic risk factors associated with elevated creatine kinase, the Ku70 gene XRCC6 and the ceramide synthase gene LASS1 were investigated because of their roles in telomere length and longe…
15356207	Age-related functional changes of prefrontal cortex in long-term memory: a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation study.	aging	2004-09-08	Neuroimaging findings suggest that the lateralization of prefrontal cortex activation associated with episodic memory performance is reduced by aging. It is still a matter of debate whether this loss of asymmetry during encoding and retrieval reflects compensatory mechanisms or de-differentiation processes. We addressed this issue by the transient interference produced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which directly assesses causal relationships between performance and stimulated regions. We compared the effects of rTMS (a rapid-rate train occurring simultaneously to the presentation of memoranda) applied to the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on visuospatial recognition memory in 66 healthy subjects divided in two classes of age (<45 and >50 years). In young subjects, rTMS of the right DLPFC interfered with retrieval more than left DLPFC stimulation. The asymmetry of the effect progressively vanished with aging, as indicated by bilateral int…
17405666	Processing of facial blends of emotion: support for right hemisphere cognitive aging.	aging	2007-02-??	Clinical research on facial emotions has focused primarily on differences between right and left hemiface. Social psychology, however, has suggested that differences between upper versus lower facial displays may be more important, especially during social interactions. We demonstrated previously that upper facial displays are perceived preferentially by the right hemisphere, while lower facial displays are perceived preferentially by the left hemisphere. A marginal age-related effect was observed. The current research expands our original cohort to include 26 elderly individuals over age 62. Fifty-six, strongly right-handed, healthy, adult volunteers were tested tachistoscopically by flashing randomized facial displays of emotion to the right and left visual fields. The stimuli consisted of line drawings displaying various combinations of emotions on the upper and lower face. The subjects were tested under two conditions: without attend instruction and with instructions to attend to t…
14506079	Age and aerobic exercise training effects on whole body and muscle protein metabolism.	aging	2004-01-??	Aging in humans is associated with loss of lean body mass, but the causes are incompletely defined. Lean tissue mass and function depend on continuous rebuilding of proteins. We tested the hypotheses that whole body and mixed muscle protein metabolism declines with age in men and women and that aerobic exercise training would partly reverse this decline. Seventy-eight healthy, previously untrained men and women aged 19-87 yr were studied before and after 4 mo of bicycle training (up to 45 min at 80% peak heart rate, 3-4 days/wk) or control (flexibility) activity. At the whole body level, protein breakdown (measured as [13C]leucine and [15N]phenylalanine flux), Leu oxidation, and protein synthesis (nonoxidative Leu disposal) declined with age at a rate of 4-5% per decade (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass was closely correlated with protein turnover and declined 3% per decade (P < 0.001), but even after covariate adjustment for fat-free mass, the decline in protein turnover with age remained si…
18234461	H1 histone subtype constitution and phosphorylation state of the ageing cell system of human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	lifespan	2008-03-??	Until a few years ago, the H1 histones were exclusively considered to be the architectural proteins of chromatin involved in chromatin condensation. However there is now increasing data to support the hypothesis that the H1 subtypes are involved in genomic integrity and that they may have unexpected functional roles in various biological processes such as in differentiation and DNA repair, apoptosis and lifespan. Moreover, the H1 histones are phosphorylated to a great extent. Recent work has implicated phosphorylation of H1 in the regulation of chromatin remodeling. In light of the fact that chromatin reorganization and heterochromatin formation has been shown to take place during ageing and senescence, in the present investigation, we have analyzed the changes that take place in the somatic H1 linker histone subtype profile and their phosphorylation states in human peripheral blood lymphocytes as a function of donor age. Results from this work show that there is a significant age-rela…
28323025	Ability to predict resting energy expenditure with six equations compared to indirect calorimetry in octogenarian men.	aging	2017-??-??	The accuracy of predictive equations for calculating resting energy expenditure (REE) in elderly people has been questioned. Aging is associated with progressive declines in REE, which partly is explained by loss of fat free mass (FFM). Against this background we aimed to identify the most accurate predictive equation for REE in octogenarian men, taking body composition into account and using indirect calorimetry as reference value. REE was measured in 22 men (mean age 82.6±0.3years) and compared with six predictive equations: two based on FFM and four based on body weight, height and/or age. FFM was derived from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses. Spearman's rank correlations showed a moderate to high positive monotonic correlation (r=0.62 to 0.79) between measured and calculated REE (all p<0.005).The mean calculated REE was significantly different from measured REE for all equations except Mifflin-St Jeor. A calculated REE within 10% of measured REE was considered acceptable a…
17884748	Near-infrared spectroscopy as an alternative to the Wada test for language mapping in children, adults and special populations.	aging	2007-09-??	The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is the most widely used procedure for pre-surgical evaluation of language lateralization in epileptic patients. However, apart from being invasive, this technique is not applicable in young children or patients who present mental retardation and/or language deficits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly employed as a non-invasive alternative. Again, this method is more difficult to use with young children, especially hyperactive ones, since they have to remain motionless during data acquisition. The aim of this study was to determine whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used as an alternative technique to investigate language lateralization in children and special populations. Unlike Wada test, NIRS is non-invasive, and it is more tolerant to movement artefacts than fMRI. In the present study, NIRS data were acquired in four epileptic children, a 12-year-old boy with pervasive developmental disorder and a 3-yea…
17105387	Erythrocyte plasma membrane redox system in human aging.	aging	2006-??-??	Eukaryotic cells display a plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) that transfers electrons from intracellular substrates to extracellular electron acceptors. The physiologic importance of PMRS is still not fully understood. The authors have carried out studies to determine the activity of PMRS in human erythrocytes as a function of age and correlate the activity with total plasma antioxidant capacity in an effort to understand the role of PMRS in human aging. The study was carried out on 80 normal healthy subjects of both genders between the ages of 18 and 85 years. The activity of erythrocyte PMRS was estimated by following the reduction of ferricyanide. The total antioxidant capacity of the plasma was estimated in terms of Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) values. A significant (p < 0.0001) positive correlation (r = 0.7797) is observed between PMRS activity of erythrocytes and human age. There is an age-dependent decrease in total plasma antioxidant capacity measured in terms of …
10691172	Age-related changes in the magnitude of ventricular depolarization vector: analyses by magnetocardiogram.	aging	2000-01-??	The magnetocardiogram has the beneficial feature that permits the strength and location of the current dipole to be estimated. This study examines the issue of whether the magnitude of the heart current during depolarization phase was influenced by the age of healthy subjects. The magnetocardiograms were recorded by means of a second-derivative SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer (BT Corp, Model BMP, San Diego, CA) in 150 healthy subjects. The subjects were subgrouped into 5 age-based categories according to the age. The current dipole of the maximum QRS complex was determined from isofield contour maps during the ventricular depolarization phase, and no significant differences were observed in the magnitude in the current source for any age category. However, the amplitudes of the RV5 and SV1 + RV5 in the standard electrocardiogram were larger in 65 to 74-year-old women than other age groups, and the SV1 + RV5 was smaller for the 45 to 74-year-old men than…
27070046	Your Way to a Better Theory of Mind: A Healthy Diet Relates to Better Faux Pas Recognition in Older Adults.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: Aging is characterized by a well-documented worsening of general cognition, and also a decline in social understanding such as the ability to recognize emotions or detect socially inappropriate behavior (faux pas). Several studies have demonstrated that lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, social integration, smoking) tend to offset general cognitive decline, and we examined whether they also help to offset age-related declines in social cognition.    METHODS: There were 56 participants aged 60 years or over. General cognition was measured using a matrices task and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Emotion recognition was measured by the matching of faces to emotion sounds and bodies to sounds. Faux pas recognition was measured by 16 videos, examining participants' ability to differentiate appropriate and inappropriate social behavior. Diet, exercise, social integration, and smoking habits were measured via questionnaires.    RESULTS: For general cogniti…
16804031	Geroprotection by glycerol: insights to its mechanisms and clinical potentials.	longevity	2006-05-??	Chaperones, particularly the heat-shock proteins, are considered as key players in the maintenance of protein homeostasis and are associated with longevity and cellular immortalization. In this study, we investigated the geroprotective activity of the chemical chaperone glycerol. Glycerol showed significant chaperoning activity in refolding heat-denatured luciferase in vivo and in protecting cells from heat stress-induced cytotoxicity. This was accompanied by decrease in p53, an upregulation of a stress chaperone mortalin/mtHsp70, and an increase in proteasome activity in the presence of oxidative stress.
28219752	Sleep does not facilitate insight in older adults.	aging	2017-04-??	Sleep has been shown to foster the process of insight generation in young adults during problem solving activities. Aging is characterized by substantial changes in sleep architecture altering memory consolidation. Whether sleep might promote the occurrence of insight in older adults as well has not yet been tested experimentally. To address this issue, we tested healthy young and old volunteers on an insight problem solving task, involving both explicit and implicit features, before and after a night of sleep or a comparable wakefulness period. Data showed that insight emerged significantly less frequently after a night of sleep in older adults compared to young. Moreover, there was no difference in the magnitude of insight occurrence following sleep and daytime -consolidation in aged participants. We further found that acquisition of implicit knowledge in the task before sleep potentiated the gain of insight in young participants, but this effect was not observed in aged participants…
15019327	Asymmetry of choroidal venous vascular patterns in the human eye.	aging	2004-03-??	PURPOSE: To describe the angioarchitecture of choroidal veins in normal subjects using indocyanine green (ICG) angiography.    DESIGN: Consecutive observational case series.    PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six eyes of 33 healthy volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 81 years (50.0+/-18.2 [mean +/- standard deviation]).    METHODS: Indocyanine green angiography was performed with a modified Topcon fundus ICG camera. Montage images were obtained during the venous phase of the ICG angiogram.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Indocyanine green angiographic montage images covering all areas of the observable fundus.    RESULTS: Eighteen of 36 eyes examined (50%) showed asymmetry of choroidal venous vascular patterns consistent with a preferential route of choroidal venous drainage of the macular region. Twelve of the 18 eyes with a preferred drainage route drained superotemporally; the remaining 6 eyes drained by either an inferotemporal or a superonasal route. A preferential choroidal venous drainage route…
133331	Does ATP decrease exponentially during red cell aging?	aging	????-??-??	The precise changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during red cell aging have not been established. Studies of ATP content based on cell density, a presumptive index of red cell age, observations in anemic subjects in whom age-dependent hemeolysis may occur and studies of the loss of metabolic capability with aging, suggest that the reduction in red cell ATP may be a continuous process, approximating a negative expotential function. Several experimental approaches could be used to support or refute this hypothesis.
11450711	Race and sex effects on the association between muscle strength, soft tissue, and bone mineral density in healthy elders: the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study.	aging	2001-07-??	Two factors generally reported to influence bone density are body composition and muscle strength. However, it is unclear if these relationships are consistent across race and sex, especially in older persons. If differences do exist by race and/or sex, then strategies to maintain bone mass or minimize bone loss in older adults may need to be modified accordingly. Therefore, we examined the independent effects of bone mineral-free lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), and muscle strength on regional and whole body bone mineral density (BMD) in a cohort of 2,619 well-functioning older adults participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with complete measures. Participants included 738 white women, 599 black women, 827 white men, and 455 black men aged 70-79 years. BMD (g/cm2) of the femoral neck, whole body, upper and lower limb, and whole body and upper limb bone mineral-free LM and FM was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Handgrip strength and…
17178556	Age related variation of salivary testosterone values in healthy Japanese males.	aging	2006-12-??	OBJECTIVE: We examined age associated variation in salivary testosterone values among Japanese males as well as anthropometric measurements.    METHODS: Salivary samples were collected in pretreated sodium azide treated tubes. The first series: 15-79-year-old males (n = 99); two morning and two evening samples were collected at home for two days. The second series: 90-year-old males (n = 29); one morning sample was collected. Testosterone values were determined using an iodine125-based radioimmunoassay kit modified for saliva.    RESULTS: Results show 1) a significant decrease in salivary testosterone values from 20s to 40s and older, 2) no significant decline after 40 through 90 years old, 3) no significant age-related differences in the degree of intraindividual diurnal fluctuation across age groups of 40-70s, and 4) higher BMI is associated with the lower salivary testosterone among 40-70s.    CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neither a constant decrease of salivary testostero…
9322566	Total body potassium and body fat: relevance to aging.	aging	1997-10-??	Understanding the mechanisms that govern sarcopenia (depletion of muscle mass with age) may suggest ways to preserve lean tissue and functional capacity, and to maintain quality of life in the elderly. We investigated the body-composition changes in normal aging in a cross-sectional study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 20-89 y, which examines the differences in body cell mass and fat as a function of age. In aging, the assumptions of indirect body-composition-measurement techniques, such as the "constant" hydration coefficient of lean body mass or the "constant" density of fat-free mass, may not hold. Therefore, we selected body-composition-measurement techniques that are not sensitive to assumptions about the composition of lean tissue. Cellular mass, lean body mass, and fat were assessed "directly" by total body potassium (TBK) measurements and neutron inelastic scattering. Our results show that TBK content declines at a rate of 7.20 +/- 1.00 mg K.kg body wt-1.y-1 for females (r = 0.…
19776557	Erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil function in an aging population.	aging	2010-??-??	There are limited investigations which have examined the relationship between neutrophil activation and erythrocyte aggregation in older persons. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between neutrophil activation and erythrocyte aggregation (EA) in an aging population. Twenty-eight male and female subjects were allocated into one of four groups with 7 participants in each group (group 1, 20-29 years; group 2, 30-39 years; group 3, 40-49 years; group 4, 50-59 years). EA was determined using the Myrenne aggregometer. Neutrophil function (respiratory burst and phagocytic activity) was assessed using flow cytometry. EA was found to increase with age. An ANOVA showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase for EA in autologous plasma in group 4 compared to groups 1 and 2. An ANOVA and Pearson's correlation showed that phagocytic activity decreased with age. Furthermore, a positive correlation between stimulated phagocytic activity and erythrocyte aggregability at l…
8832544	Cardiovascular and peak VO2 responses to supine exercise: effects of age and training status.	aging	1996-07-??	Although stroke volume during exercise is affected by aging and posture, few studies have carefully examined the heart rate, blood pressure, and peak oxygen uptake (VO2) responses of older subjects to supine exercise. The present study examined these responses during graded supine cycling in younger (21-30 yr) and older (51-62 yr) untrained (Treadmill VO2max = 47.0 vs 32.3 ml.kg-1.min-1) and endurance-trained (66.3 vs 52.7 ml.kg-1.min-1) men (N = 6/group). All subjects had lower (P < 0.05) peak VO2 (ml.min-1) and peak heart rate responses during supine cycling compared with treadmill exercise. Additionally, the age-related reduction in peak VO2 (approximately 20-30%) was similar for supine compared with treadmill testing, even when normalized to fat-free leg volume and fat-free mass, respectively. However, at given absolute intensities (VO2) of supine exercise, heart rates were 10-15 beats.min-1 less (P < 0.05) in both older groups. Across relative supine work intensities (% of peak), …
23505255	Cohort profile: The Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).	aging	2014-06-??	Similar to other industrialized countries, Germany's population is ageing. Whereas some people enjoy good physical and cognitive health into old age, others suffer from a multitude of age-related disorders and impairments which reduce life expectancy and affect quality of life. To identify and characterize the factors associated with 'healthy' vs. 'unhealthy' ageing, we have launched the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional project that ascertains a large number of ageing-related variables from a wide range of different functional domains. Phenotypic assessments include factors related to geriatrics and internal medicine, immunology, genetics, psychology, sociology and economics. Baseline recruitment of the BASE-II cohort was recently completed and has led to the sampling of 1600 older adults (age range 60-80 years), as well as 600 younger adults (20-35 years) serving as the basic population for in-depth analyses. BASE-II data are linked to the G…
29372512	Some further clarifications on age-related differences in Stroop interference.	aging	2018-??-??	Both the locus and processes underlying the age-related differences in Stroop interference are usually inferred from changes in magnitudes of standard (i.e., overall) Stroop interference. Therefore, this study addressed these still-open issues directly. To this end, a sample of younger (18-26 years old) and healthy older (72-97 years old) was administered the semantic Stroop paradigm (that assesses the relative contribution of semantic compared to response conflict both of which contribute to overall Stroop interference) combined with a single-letter coloring and cuing (SLCC) procedure. Independently of an increased attentional focus on the relevant color dimension of Stroop words induced by SLCC (as compared to all letters colored and cued, ALCC), greater magnitudes of standard Stroop interference were observed in older (as compared to younger) adults. These differences were due to greater magnitudes of response conflict whereas magnitudes of semantic conflict remained significant and…
24338233	Age-related changes in the rate of muscle activation and rapid force characteristics.	lifespan, aging	2014-04-??	Declines in muscle size and strength are commonly reported as a consequence of aging; however, few studies have investigated the influence of aging on the rate of muscle activation and rapid force characteristics across the lifespan. This study aims to investigate the effects of aging on the rate of muscle activation and rapid force characteristics of the plantar flexors. Plantar flexion peak force (PF), absolute (peak, 50, and 100-200 ms), and relative (10 %, 30 %, and 50 %) rate of force development (RFD), the rapid to maximal force ratio (RFD/PF), and the rate of electromyography rise (RER) were examined during an isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in young (age = 22 ± 2 years), middle-aged (43 ± 2 years), and old (69 ± 5 years) men. The old men exhibited lower PF (30.7 % and 27.6 % lower, respectively) and absolute (24.4-55.1 %) and relative (16.4-28.9 %) RFD values compared to the young and middle-aged men (P ≤ 0.03). RER values were similar between the young and old me…
1492752	Aging, energy expenditure and nutritional status: evidence for denutrition-related hypermetabolism.	aging	1992-??-??	Resting energy expenditure (REE) and nutritional status have been evaluated in 39 elderly inpatients (mean age 84.0 +/- 6.9 years). The nutritional status declined with aging as shown by significant negative correlations between age and, respectively, weight (p < 0.001), fat free mass (FFM) (p < 0.01) and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.01). The best prediction for REE when considering the whole population was given by FFM (p < 0.001). Increased REE was observed in patients after recent surgery, related to an inflammatory state, as shown by increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein and orosomucoid. Irrespectively of the inflammatory state, REE was also found to be related to the nutritional status: patients who showed a BMI < 20 had higher REE than patients with a BMI > 20 (28.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 22.1 +/- 0.7 kcal/kg of body weight; p < 0.001; 35.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 30.9 +/- 1.0 kcal/kg of FFM; p < 0.02). These results increasingly suggest that elderly patients may suffer from denutrition relevan…
14557479	Oxidative stress does not modulate metabolic rate or skeletal muscle sympathetic activity with primary aging in adult humans.	aging	2003-10-??	Support of resting metabolic rate (RMR) by the beta-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system is attenuated with age and contributes to declines in RMR. This may be mediated by an age-associated increase in oxidative stress that can suppress beta-adrenergic responsiveness and/or modulate sympathetic activity. To address these issues, RMR was determined in 12 young (23 +/- 1 yr, mean +/- SE) and 21 older (68 +/- 3 yr) adults before and during systemic infusion of ascorbic acid [bolus, 0.06 g/kg fat free mass (FFM); drip, 0.02]. Ascorbic acid increased plasma concentrations similarly in young (72 +/- 5 to 1107 +/- 114 micro mol/liter) and older (70 +/- 6 to 1022 +/- 63 micro mol/liter) adults, and reduced (P = 0.001) plasma concentrations of isoprostanes (young, -82.8 +/- 47; older, -107 +/- 29 pg/ml). Baseline RMR(FFM) was lower (5719 +/- 215 vs. 6703 +/- 328 kJ/d; P = 0.001) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was greater (MSNA, 28 +/- 2 vs. 23 +/- 3 bursts/min; P…
12039443	The proteasome in brain aging.	aging	2002-04-??	The proteasome is a large intracellular protease, present in all cells of the central nervous system (CNS), that is responsible for the majority of intracellular protein degradation. In particular, the proteasome is responsible for the degradation of most oxidized, aggregated, and misfolded proteins. The importance of proteasome activity to neuronal homeostasis is highlighted by previous studies demonstrating that proteasome inhibition alone is sufficient to induce neuron death in vitro. Recent studies indicate that alterations in proteasome activity may occur during, and possibly contribute to, the aging process. These data raise the possibility that alterations in the proteasome proteolytic pathway may contribute to the elevations in protein oxidation, protein aggregation, and neurodegeneration evident in the aging CNS. The focus of this review is to describe what is currently known about the proteasome in the CNS, describe established age-related alterations in proteasome biology, a…
1669505	Body composition, age and femoral bone mass of young adult women.	aging	1991-02-??	Maximum bone mineral density of the femur was measured by dual-photon densitometry in 282 healthy white women, aged 20 to 40 years. Femoral sites included the neck, Wards triangle, and the trochanter. Quetelet Index was used as a measure of weight adjusted for height, and body composition was measured using four-point bioelectrical impedance and anthropometry. Maximum bone mass is believed to be an important measure if the level established which remain characteristic or predict bone mineral density during the aging process. Body weight was correlated with each measure of femoral bone density, including the femoral neck (r = .42), Wards triangle (r = .34), and the trochanter (r = .44). Weight was more highly correlated with bone mass than with other measures of body composition, including fat-free mass, percent body fat, humeral muscle area, and humeral fat area. We observed that age was negatively associated with bone mass at all three femoral sites, even in subjects within the age ra…
17327545	Relationships between housing and healthy aging in very old age.	aging	2007-02-??	PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to examine the relationship between aspects of objective and perceived housing and aspects of healthy aging, defined as independence in daily activities and subjective well-being. Furthermore, this research examined the comparability of relationships between housing and healthy aging in the five European countries.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the ENABLE-AGE Project, from home interviews with a sample of 1,918 very old people aged 75 to 89 years living alone in their own homes in Swedish, German, British, Hungarian and Latvian urban areas.    RESULTS: Participants living in better accessible homes, who perceive their home as meaningful and useful, and who think that external influences are not responsible for their housing situation are more independent in daily activities and have a better sense of well-being. Moreover, these results apply to all five national samples.    IMPLICATIONS: The findings can widen the perspective when striving…
28725270	Inter-segmental motions of the foot: differences between younger and older healthy adult females.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Although accumulative evidence exists that support the applicability of multi-segmental foot models (MFMs) in evaluating foot motion in various pathologic conditions, little is known of the effect of aging on inter-segmental foot motion. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in inter-segmental motion of the foot between older and younger adult healthy females during gait using a MFM with 15-marker set.    METHODS: One hundred symptom-free females, who had no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis, were evaluated using MFM with 15-marker set. They were divided into young ( = 50, 20-35 years old) and old ( = 50, 60-69 years old) groups. Coefficients of multiple correlations were evaluated to assess the similarity of kinematic curve. Inter-segmental angles (hindfoot, forefoot, and hallux) were calculated at each gait phase. To evaluate the effect of gait speed on intersegmental foot motion, subgroup analysis was performed according to the similar speed of wa…
9762898	Age-related increased susceptibility of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) to in vitro oxidation induced by gamma-radiolysis of water.	aging	1998-09-18	In the present study, we investigated the age-related susceptibility of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) to oxidation. HDL were obtained from healthy, normolipidemic young, middle-aged and elderly subjects. Oxidation of HDL was induced in vitro by oxygen free radicals generated by water gamma-radiolysis, and followed by the decrease of endogenous vitamin E and the formation of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, as well as the alterations of apolipoproteins A-I/A-II. The resistance of HDL to oxidation, evaluated by the length of the lag phase, decreased with aging. This increased oxidizability of HDL with aging could have a dramatic impact on the development of atherosclerosis in the elderly population.
25589585	The effect of age on postural and cognitive task performance while using vibrotactile feedback.	aging	2015-04-01	Vibrotactile feedback (VTF) has been shown to improve balance performance in healthy people and people with vestibular disorders in a single-task experimental condition. It is unclear how age-related changes in balance affect the ability to use VTF and if there are different attentional requirements for old and young adults when using VTF. Twenty younger and 20 older subjects participated in this two-visit study to examine the effect of age, VTF, sensory condition, cognitive task, duration of time, and visit on postural and cognitive performance. Postural performance outcome measures included root mean square of center of pressure (COP) and trunk tilt, and cognitive performance was assessed using the reaction time (RT) from an auditory choice RT task. The results showed that compared with younger adults, older adults had an increase in COP in fixed platform conditions when using VTF, although they were able to reduce COP during sway-referenced platform conditions. Older adults also did…
19432388	Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and early-onset bipolar disorder: two facets of one entity?	aging	2009-??-??	Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have recently been the subject of highly controversial debate, due to theories regarding underlying pathophysiological processes and a clinical overlap of symptoms. Epidemiological data, clinical aspects neuroimaging, neurochemical, and genetic studies suggest that there may be a possible relationship between biological factors and clinical characteristics in the development of symptoms. However, longitudinal data supporting the hypothesis of a diagnostic shift from BD to ADHD symptoms and vice versa are currently not available. These would be essential to enable further investigations into whether these two disorders possibly represent two different aspects of an underlying common psychopathophysiological entity.
22437204	Personality and reduced incidence of walking limitation in late life: findings from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study.	aging	2012-11-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between openness to experience and conscientiousness and incident reported walking limitation.    METHOD: The study population consisted of 786 men and women aged 71-81 years (M = 75 years, SD = 2.7) participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition-Cognitive Vitality Substudy.    RESULTS: Nearly 20% of participants (155/786) developed walking limitation during 6 years of follow-up. High openness was associated with a reduced risk of walking limitation (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.98), independent of sociodemographic factors, health conditions, and conscientiousness. This association was not mediated by lifestyle factors and was not substantially modified by other risk factors for functional disability. Conscientiousness was not associated with risk of walking limitation (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77-1.07).    DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that personality dimensions, specifically higher openness to experience…
16803980	Naive T cells in the elderly: are they still there?	aging	2006-05-??	One of the most striking changes in the primary lymphoid organs during human aging is the progressive involution of the thymus. As a consequence, the rate of naïve T cell output dramatically declines with age and the peripheral T cell pool shrinks. These changes lead to increased incidence of severe infections and decreased protective effect of vaccinations in the elderly. Little is, however, known of the composition and function of the residual naïve T cell repertoire in elderly persons. To evaluate the impact of aging on the naïve T cell pool, we investigated the quantity, phenotype, function, composition, and senescence status of CD45RA(+)CD28(+) human T cells--a phenotype generally considered as naïve cells--from both young and old healthy donors. We found a significant decrease in the number of CD45RA(+)CD28(+) T cells in the elderly, whereas the proliferative response of these cells is still unimpaired. In addition to their reduced number, CD45RA(+)CD28(+) T cells from old donors…
27544203	Are there gender differences in young vs. aging brains under risk decision-making? An optical brain imaging study.	aging	2017-??-??	Few research publications have reported on gender-dependent neural correlates of risk decision-making in older adults. In this study, we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to comprehensively investigate both age- and gender-dependent differences in neural correlates in response to a well-utilized risk decision-making protocol, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART). A newly-developed technique, atlas-guided diffuse optical tomography (atlas-DOT), was used to image the prefrontal cortices (PFC) of healthy subjects in two age groups (25-40 years; 60-92 years) using BART stimulation. The behavioral measures and brain activations imaged by atlas-DOT were recorded and compared for both age groups. Three-factor analysis of variance was conducted to include all effects of age (young, old), gender (male, female), case (win, lose) and their interactions for both behavioral and hemodynamic responses. The results indicated age differences in cortical activation patterns, activati…
25856638	Healthy Aging and Concerns Among Elderly Japanese: A Text Analysis Approach.	aging	2015-??-??	Japan is facing an unprecedented aging society. In 2013, 25.1% of the total population in Japan was 65 years old and over. One third of the population in Japan will be at least 65 years old in 2035; healthy aging is crucial for public health and society in Japan. Under the budget limitations of social security, policies and frequent policy changes have created great uncertainty and concern for the elderly population. Given these circumstances, we conducted questionnaire surveys in 2010 to examine concerns in this age-group. In 2010, we sent questionnaires to university graduates 65 years old and older, randomly selected from a list of an alumni association of 11 universities. The questionnaires were open-ended and asked them to write any concerns that they had about health care, health policy, health systems, and their future. We received 344 responses. Among those who responded, 271 (78.8%) respondents said that they had concerns. We conducted a text analysis (Trend Search-Keyword Ass…
22292741	Age-dependent skewing of X chromosome inactivation appears delayed in centenarians' offspring. Is there a role for allelic imbalance in healthy aging and longevity?	longevity, lifespan, aging	2012-04-??	Recently, it has been proposed that age-related X chromosome inactivation (XCI) skewing can clinically result in late-onset X-linked disorders. This observation leads to hypothesize that age-related skewed XCI might also influence lifespan in women. To investigate this issue, we employed a new experimental model of longevity and healthy aging including 55 female centenarians, 40 of their offspring, 33 age-matched offspring of both non-long-lived parents and 41 young women. Peripheral blood DNA from 169 females was screened for heterozygosity at the HUMARA locus. We confirmed that skewing of XCI is an age-dependent phenomenon. However, skewed XCI was significantly less severe and frequent in centenarians' offspring [degree of skewing (DS) = 0.16 ± 0.02] compared to age-matched offspring of both non-long-lived parents (DS = 0.24 ± 0.02) (P < 0.05). A second goal was to assess whether changes in XCI pattern could be a consequence of loss of methylation on X chromosome. Using a methylation…
8261780	Changes in corneal autofluorescence and corneal epithelial barrier function with aging.	aging	1993-11-??	Corneal epithelial permeability studies using fluorophotometers were performed on 90 eyes of 51 normal subjects. After recording the autofluorescence of the cornea (AFC) and of the lens (AFL), we applied 20 microliters of 2% sodium fluorescein to the conjunctival sac. The corneal fluorescence 45 min later (F45), which paralleled the corneal epithelial permeability to fluorescein, was measured by fluorophotometer and analyzed. All parameters of the two eyes of each subject correlated well with each other. There was positive correlation between AFL and patient age and between AFC and patient age (r = 0.78, p < 0.001, and r = 0.74, p < 0.001, respectively). The F45 increased exponentially with advancing age (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). The strong correlation between AFC and AFL in each eye (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) indicated corresponding aging processes in both the cornea and the lens. The increase in epithelial permeability with age possibly represents a subclinical breakdown of barrier function,…
19014964	Degradation products analysis of an Fc fusion protein using LC/MS methods.	aging	2009-01-01	The following analytical methods have been used to identify and quantify degradation products in an E. coli expressed human immunoglobulin G Fc fusion protein in both liquid and lyophilized forms: two-dimensional AEX/RP/MS, limited proteolysis followed by LC/MS, and tryptic digestion followed by LC/MS/MS. After aging in a potassium phosphate pH 7.0 buffer for 3 months at 29 degrees C, peptide map analysis revealed that asparagine N78 (N297 according to Edelman sequencing) of the CH2 domain was the most rapidly deamidated site in the molecule probably due to the lack of the N-linked glycan on this asparagine, but this deamidation can be prevented under properly formulated conditions. This is the first report on the rate of deamidation on N297 of an IgG molecule without glycosylation. The active protein portion of the Fc fusion protein contains two methionine residues that are potentially susceptible to oxidation. Limited proteolysis was employed to cleave the active protein portion and …
1805811	The relationship between muscle mass and muscle strength in the elderly.	aging	1991-06-??	To determine the extent that muscle mass is predictive of muscle strength in the elderly, anthropomorphic estimates of muscle area and impedance measurements of muscle mass and peak isometric muscle strength were obtained in a relatively healthy older population over 65 years of age (mean age = 71.7; n = 218). Midarm muscle area correlated strongly with upper arm strength (r = 0.68, P less than 0.0001) while midthigh muscle area had a much lower correlation with thigh muscle strength (r = 0.29, P less than 0.0001). These muscle area calculations also include bone area. Lean body mass calculated by bioelectric impedance correlated highly with cumulative muscle strength measured by summing all muscle groups (r = 0.79, P less than 0.0001). To determine whether aging alters muscle strength per unit of muscle mass, additional middle-aged subjects were included, and three groups, middle-aged (55-64) (n = 78), young-old (65-74) (n = 161), and old-old (75+) (n = 57), were compared. A significa…
19445606	Age-related neural changes during memory conjunction errors.	aging	2010-07-??	Human behavioral studies demonstrate that healthy aging is often accompanied by increases in memory distortions or errors. Here we used event-related fMRI to examine the neural basis of age-related memory distortions. We used the memory conjunction error paradigm, a laboratory procedure known to elicit high levels of memory errors. For older adults, right parahippocampal gyrus showed significantly greater activity during false than during accurate retrieval. We observed no regions in which activity was greater during false than during accurate retrieval for young adults. Young adults, however, showed significantly greater activity than old adults during accurate retrieval in right hippocampus. By contrast, older adults demonstrated greater activity than young adults during accurate retrieval in right inferior and middle prefrontal cortex. These data are consistent with the notion that age-related memory conjunction errors arise from dysfunction of hippocampal system mechanisms, rather …
18383693	Multifractality, sample entropy, and wavelet analyses for age-related changes in the peripheral cardiovascular system: preliminary results.	aging	2008-02-??	Using signal processing measures we evaluate the effect of aging on the peripheral cardiovascular system. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals, reflecting the microvascular perfusion, are recorded on the forearm of 27 healthy subjects between 20-30, 40-50, or 60-70 years old. Wavelet-based representations, Hölder exponents, and sample entropy values are computed for each time series. The results indicate a possible modification of the peripheral cardiovascular system with aging. Thus, the endothelial-related metabolic activity decreases, but not significantly, with aging. Furthermore, LDF signals are more monofractal for elderly subjects than for young people for whom LDF signals are weakly multifractal: the average range of Holder exponents computed with a parametric generalized quadratic variation based estimation method is 0.13 for subjects between 20 and 30 years old and 0.06 for subjects between 60 and 70 years old. Moreover, the average mean sample entropy value of LDF signals s…
28168006	Individual CpG sites that are associated with age and life expectancy become hypomethylated upon aging.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in simple molecular biomarkers for biological aging. Age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes at specific CG dinucleotides can be combined into epigenetic age predictors to estimate chronological age-and the deviation of chronological and predicted age (∆) seems to be associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, we have further validated this association and analyzed whether or not individual age-associated CG-dinucleotides (CpGs) are related to life expectancy.    FINDINGS: In the German ESTHER cohort, we used 864 DNAm profiles of blood samples as the discovery set and 1000 DNAm profiles as the validation set to predict chronological age with three previously reported age predictors-based on 99, 71, or 353 age-associated CpGs. Several of these individual CpGs were significantly associated with life expectancy, and for some of these CpGs, this was even reproducible in the independent datasets. Notably, those CpGs that revealed signifi…
1997571	Electroencephalographic sleep in the healthy "old old": a comparison with the "young old" in visually scored and automated measures.	aging	1991-03-??	This report extends the normative study of sleep into healthy 80-year-olds and compares them with healthy 70- and 60-year-olds. We observed stability of sleep efficiency and rapid eye movement sleep across three decades of late life, but a slight decline of slow-wave sleep in the 80-year-olds (decreased total delta wave counts). Women showed better preservation of slow-wave sleep than men. Automated EEG period analysis of this phenomenon demonstrated higher rates of delta wave production in the first NREM sleep period of women compared to that of men, a finding associated with longer REM sleep latencies in women. Unexpectedly, 80-year-old women showed decay in sleep maintenance, while 80-year-old men demonstrated stability of sleep maintenance, relative to their respective 60- and 70-year-old counterparts. Implications for the understanding of sleep and its regulation in health and aging are discussed.
11078087	Effects of aging on cardiorespiratory responses to brief and intense intermittent exercise in endurance-trained athletes.	aging	2000-11-??	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aging on athletes' cardiorespiratory responses to a brief intense intermittent effort, using the force-velocity test as an exercise model. Twelve young athletes (24.8 +/- 1.3 years) and twelve master athletes (65.1 +/- 1.2 years) with similar heights, body masses, and endurance training schedules participated in this study. They performed both a maximal graded exercise and the force-velocity tests. The force-velocity test consisted of the repetition of 6-second sprints against increasing braking forces with 5-minute recovery periods. None of the subjects presented abnormal electrocardiogram responses to the tests. During the force-velocity test, the heart rate magnitudes of response in all subjects were correlated to the corresponding sprint power output (p < .001), with higher values for the young athletes (p < .001). Both groups had similar systolic blood pressure peaks of response during the force-velocity test. Both groups had…
22642232	Reduced release and binding of perforin at the immunological synapse underlies the age-related decline in natural killer cell cytotoxicity.	aging	2012-10-??	Physiological aging is accompanied by a marked reduction in natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) at the single cell level, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To address this issue, we isolated NK cells from healthy young (≤ 35 years) and old (≤ 60 years) subjects and examined the effect of age on events fundamental to the process of NKCC. Simultaneous assessment of NKCC and NK cell-target cell conjugate formation revealed a marked age-associated decline in NK cell killing but comparable conjugate formation, indicating a post-target cell binding defect was responsible for impaired NKCC. Despite a reduction in the proportion of NK cells expressing the activatory receptor NKp46, NK cells from old donors were not hyporesponsive to stimulation, as no age-associated difference was observed in the expression of the early activation marker CD69 following target cell coculture. Furthermore, intracellular levels of the key cytotoxic effector molecules perforin and granzyme B, and…
15147591	Assessment of time perception: the effect of aging.	aging	2004-05-??	Studies concerning time perception lack a validated assessment tool and a consensual "gold-standard" measure. Moreover, the present evidence suggests modification of timing with aging. This study aimed to develop and validate a neuropsychological tool to measure time perception and to study temporal perception with aging. Eighty-six healthy participants, aged 15-90 years old, were asked to verbally estimate and produce empty intervals signaled by auditory beeps, of 7-, 32-, and 58-s duration. Two tests were used as "gold-standards": estimation of the duration of time necessary to draw a clock ("clock time") and estimation of the duration of neuropsychological evaluation ("global time"). Results showed a correlation between estimation and production (p < .01) and a correlation between estimation or production and "global time" (p < .01). The correlation between either estimation or production and age (p < .01), suggested a faster "internal-clock" in the older participants. However, this…
19805420	Age-related shifts in brain activity dynamics during task switching.	aging	2010-06-??	Cognitive aging studies have suggested that older adults show declines in both sustained and transient cognitive control processes. However, previous neuroimaging studies have primarily focused on age-related change in the magnitude, but not temporal dynamics, of brain activity. The present study compared brain activity dynamics in healthy old and young adults during task switching. A mixed blocked/event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design enabled separation of transient and sustained neural activity associated with cognitive control. Relative to young adults, older adults exhibited not only decreased sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) during task-switching blocks but also increased transient activity on task-switch trials. Another pattern of age-related shift in dynamics was present in the lateral PFC (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), with younger adults showing a cue-related response during task-switch trials in lPFC and PPC, wherea…
7955798	Verapamil stereoisomers during racemic verapamil administration: effects of aging and comparisons to administration of individual stereoisomers.	aging	1994-10-??	Aging decreases elimination of racemic verapamil but reports vary regarding effects of aging on clearance of individual verapamil enantiomers. To determine effects of aging on elimination of S- and R-verapamil, racemic verapamil was infused to steady-state concentrations of approximately 30, 60, and 120 ng/ml in 27 healthy subjects ranging in age from 23 to 81 years (young, 20 to 39 years; middle aged, 40 to 59 years; old, 60 to 81 years), and enantiomer concentrations were measured at each steady-state and after infusions. S-Verapamil clearance was greater than R-verapamil clearance in all age groups (p < 0.001), and aging decreased S-verapamil (p < 0.05) and R-verapamil (p < 0.008) clearance (average +/- SD, S-verapamil clearance was 14.3 +/- 4.7, 13.4 +/- 5.2, and 11.7 +/- 5.2 ml/min/kg; R-verapamil clearance was 6.5 +/- 3.3, 5.6 +/- 2.8, and 4.5 +/- 1.6 ml/min/kg in young, middle-aged, and older subjects, respectively). Enantiomer clearance was not effected by verapamil concentrati…
23628501	Aging is not a barrier to muscle and redox adaptations: applying the repeated eccentric exercise model.	aging	2013-08-??	Despite the progress of analytic techniques and the refinement of study designs, striking disagreement exists among studies regarding the influence of exercise on muscle function and redox homeostasis in the elderly. The repeated eccentric exercise model was applied to produce long-lasting and extensive changes in redox biomarkers and to reveal more effectively the potential effects of aging on redox homeostasis. Ten young (20.6±0.5 years) and ten elderly men (64.6±1.1 years) underwent an isokinetic eccentric exercise session, which was repeated after three weeks. Muscle function/damage indices (torque, range of movement, muscle soreness and creatine kinase) and redox biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, uric acid, bilirubin and albumin) were assessed in plasma, erythrocytes or urine pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise and at 2 and 4 days post-exercise. As expected, th…
12571125	Aging and the time and frequency structure of force output variability.	aging	2003-03-??	The present study examined the time and frequency structure of force output in adult humans to determine whether the changes in complexity with age are dependent on external task demands. Healthy young (20-24 yr), old (60-69 yr), and older-old (75-90 yr) humans produced isometric force contractions to constant and sine wave targets that also varied in force level. First, force variability on each force task increased with advancing age. Second, both time and frequency analysis showed that the structure of the force output in the old and older-old adults was less complex in the constant-force level task and more complex in the sine wave force task. Third, the alterations in force output with aging were primarily due to low-frequency bands <4 Hz. These results support the postulation that the observed increase or decrease in physiological complexity with aging is influenced by the relatively fast time scale of external task demands (Vaillancourt DE and Newell KM. Neurobiol Aging 23: 1-11…
9158553	Application of bioelectrical impedance analysis to elderly populations.	aging	1997-05-??	BACKGROUND: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can potentially be used to estimate body composition in large populations studied at multiple sites. However, it is not clear whether age-specific BIA equations are necessary for accurate application of BIA to research on elderly subjects.    METHODS: We compared a published equation designed to predict fat-free mass (FFM) that had been derived in a young healthy population (mean age 27 y; mean BMI 23.9 kg/m2), with equations that we developed for the elderly by using data from 455 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (78 Y; 27.3 kg/m2), using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a reference technique. The BIA equations were then compared in an independent sample of 283 participants in the New Mexico Aging Process Study (76 y, 25.5 kg/m2), who also underwent BIA and DXA.    RESULTS: When the young-population equation was applied to Framingham, it caused an overestimation of FFM in heavier subjects that was eliminated by use …
10552758	Anthocyanins, phenolics, and color of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Pinot Noir wines from British Columbia.	aging	1999-10-??	Changes in phenolics (anthocyanins, flavonols, tartaric esters, and total phenolics) during ripening of grapes and in phenolics and color during vinification and aging of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Pinot Noir wines were studied. Anthocyanins in grape skins showed variations in accumulation pattern, concentration, and distribution depending on variety and to a lesser extent on season. During vinification, colorless phenolics increased during alcoholic fermentation, reached maximum values at pressing, and remained stable during malolactic fermentation and subsequent storage. Anthocyanins and color density, on the other hand, increased during the early stages of alcoholic fermentation, reached maximum values 2-3 days after the start of fermentation, decreased during malolactic fermentation, and slowly declined during subsequent storage. Viticultural practices that increased cluster sun exposure generally led to higher phenolics and color density of wines, whereas changing yeasts used for…
29654793	Immune signatures associated with mortality differ in elderly populations from different birth cohorts and countries even within northern Europe.	longevity, lifespan	2019-??-??	Since associations between lifespan and certain simple immune parameters such as T cell proliferative responses to mitogens were reported in the 1970´s, efforts to dissect out immune parameters correlating with morbidity and mortality have sought to define factors predicting individual longevity. Such "immune signatures" associating with defined clinical outcomes would represent biomarkers of "immunosenescence" that might also provide mechanistic insights into the ageing process. Because appropriate immune function is necessary for a healthy old age, a better understanding of immunosenescence contributing to frailty and death might allow interventions to improve personal and public health. Here, we discuss data from our studies in several different European countries and document significant differences between overtly similar populations. These findings draw attention to the marked variation even between presumably quite homogeneous populations, which may be due to the different birth…
20204780	Age-related changes in the trachea in healthy adults.	aging	2010-??-??	To investigate age-related changes in the shape of trachea, normal male volunteers (n = 83, mean +/- SD: 47.7 +/- 20.2 years old) underwent inspiratory CT scans at full inspiration and lung function tests. Subjects who showed VC < 80% predicted or FEV1 < 80% predicted on lung function tests were excluded. The CT data, which is located at 2.0 cm above the aortic arch, were transferred to a personal computer. The tracheal area (St) and two parameters, Tracheal index (Ti) and Circularity (Ci) indicating the shape of the trachea, were automatically calculated. Ti was defined the ratio of the coronal to the sagittal diameter of the trachea, and the Ci (Ci = 4piS/L2, S: tracheal area, L: tracheal perimeter) was used to indicate the roundness of the trachea. A Ci value of less than 1 indicated the distortion of the roundness. Both St and St/BSA (body surface area) showed a significant correlation with age (r = 0.37, r = 0.52; p = 0.0006, p < 0.0001). Ti was not correlated with age (r = -0.20;…
21073004	Three-dimensional analysis of facial morphology: growth, development and aging of the orolabial region.	aging	2010-??-??	Soft tissue analysis plays an increasing, strategic role in the recognition of facial alterations, but there are scanty three-dimensional reference data during normal growth, development and aging. In the current study, 532 male and 386 female healthy subjects aged 4 to 73 years were analyzed using a non-invasive, computerized electromagnetic digitizer, and normal dimensions of mouth and lips were obtained in the three-dimensional space. Labial thickness and curvature were also assessed in a selected group of 40 men and women, equally divided into young (age 21-30 yr, mean 25 yr) and old persons (age 45-65 yr, mean 55 yr). Lip vermilion area to volume, and vermilion height to cutaneous lip height ratios decreased with age in both sexes. On average, the lips were thicker in men and in young persons than in women and in old persons. Mean labial curvature was larger in young men than in the other groups, and it was more variable in young than in old persons. Data collected in the present …
12111047	A new equation especially developed for predicting resting metabolic rate in the elderly for easy use in practice.	aging	2002-06-??	BACKGROUND: Equations published in the literature for predicting resting metabolic rate (RMR) in older individuals were exclusively derived from studies with small samples of this age group.    AIM: of the present investigation was therefore to compare the measured RMR of a relatively large group of older females and males with values for RMR calculated from the most commonly used WHO [1] equations. Furthermore, on the basis of the data collected by our study group a new equation for calculating RMR in the elderly was to be developed. Variables used in this equation should be easily and exactly determinable in practice.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry after an overnight fast in a sample of 179 female (age 67.8 +/- 5.7 y, BMI 26.4 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) and 107 male (age 66.9 +/- 5.1 y, BMI 26.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)) participants in the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population of Giessen, Germany. The subjects were at least 60 years…
27351180	Development of a Whole-Body Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Approach to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of Drugs in Elderly Individuals.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Because of the vulnerability and frailty of elderly adults, clinical drug development has traditionally been biased towards young and middle-aged adults. Recent efforts have begun to incorporate data from paediatric investigations. Nevertheless, the elderly often remain underrepresented in clinical trials, even though persons aged 65 years and older receive the majority of drug prescriptions. Consequently, a knowledge gap exists with regard to pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses in elderly subjects, leaving the safety and efficacy of medicines for this population unclear.    OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to extend a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for adults to encompass the full course of healthy aging through to the age of 100 years, to support dose selection and improve pharmacotherapy for the elderly age group.    METHODS: For parameterization of the PBPK model for healthy aging individuals, the literature was scanned for …
26825439	One of the most well-established age-related changes in neural activity disappears after controlling for visual acuity.	aging	2016-04-15	Numerous studies using a variety of imaging techniques have reported age-related differences in neural activity while subjects carry out cognitive tasks. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to the potential impact of age-associated changes in sensory acuity on these findings. Studies in the visual modality frequently report that their subjects had "normal or corrected- to-normal vision." However, in most cases, there is no indication that visual acuity was actually measured, and it is likely that the investigators relied largely on self-reported visual status of subjects, which is often inaccurate. We investigated whether differences in visual acuity influence one of the most commonly observed findings in the event-related potentials literature on cognitive aging, a reduction in posterior P3b amplitude, which is an index of cognitive decision-making/updating. Well-matched young (n=26) and old adults (n=29) participated in a visual oddball task. Measured visual acuity with corre…
24659482	Select aging biomarkers based on telomere length and chronological age to build a biological age equation.	aging	2014-06-??	The purpose of this study is to build a biological age (BA) equation combining telomere length with chronological age (CA) and associated aging biomarkers. In total, 139 healthy volunteers were recruited from a Chinese Han cohort in Beijing. A genetic index, renal function indices, cardiovascular function indices, brain function indices, and oxidative stress and inflammation indices (C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured and analyzed. A BA equation was proposed based on selected parameters, with terminal telomere restriction fragment (TRF) and CA as the two principal components. The selected aging markers included mitral annulus peak E anterior wall (MVEA), intima-media thickness (IMT), cystatin C (CYSC), D-dimer (DD), and digital symbol test (DST). The BA equation was: BA = −2.281TRF + 26.321CYSC + 0.025DD − 104.419MVEA + 34.863IMT − 0.265DST + 0.305CA + 26.346. To conclude, telomere length and CA as double benchmarks may be a new method to build a BA.
26928884	The Role of Medial Temporal Lobe Regions in Incidental and Intentional Retrieval of Item and Relational Information in Aging.	aging	2016-??-??	Considerable neuropsychological and neuroimaging work indicates that the medial temporal lobes are critical for both item and relational memory retrieval. However, there remain outstanding issues in the literature, namely the extent to which medial temporal lobe regions are differentially recruited during incidental and intentional retrieval of item and relational information, and the extent to which aging may affect these neural substrates. The current fMRI study sought to address these questions; participants incidentally encoded word pairs embedded in sentences and incidental item and relational retrieval were assessed through speeded reading of intact, rearranged, and new word-pair sentences, while intentional item and relational retrieval were assessed through old/new associative recognition of a separate set of intact, rearranged, and new word pairs. Results indicated that, in both younger and older adults, anterior hippocampus and perirhinal cortex indexed incidental and intenti…
9582614	Age-related changes of neuro-endocrine-immune interactions in healthy humans.	aging	????-??-??	Numerous interactions exist among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, mediated by neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines. The function of these systems shows patterns of circadian rhythmicity and a number of age-related changes in the 24-hour hormonal and nonhormonal rhythms have been found in older human beings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of altered integration among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems in older adults. Cortisol, melatonin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulatinghormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) serum levels were measured and lymphocyte subpopulation analyses were performed on blood samples collected every four hours for 24 hours from seven healthy young subjects aged 36-58 years (mean age +/- s.e. 45.28 +/- 3.31) and from seven healthy old subjects aged 65-78 years (mean age +/- s.e. 68.57 +/- 1.91). There was a statistically s…
19966537	Force production capacity and functional reflex activity in young and elderly men.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that biological aging results in impaired force production of the lower extremities and deficits in reflex activity. This study therefore investigated maximal and explosive force production capacity, functional reflex activity (FRA) during gait perturbations, and the relationship between variables of force production capacity and FRA in young and elderly men.    METHODS: Twenty-eight young (age 27±3 yrs, n=14) and old (age 67±4 yrs, n=14) healthy active men were tested for decelerating impulses on a treadmill and for their maximal isometric leg extension force (MIF) and rate of force development (RFD) on a leg-press.    RESULTS: MIF and RFD were significantly lower in the elderly than in younger participants (MIF ~45%, p<0.01; RFD ~50%, p<0.01). Elderly subjects showed significant decreases in FRA in the prime mover which compensated for the decelerating impulse (FRA ~29%, p<0.05). No significant correlations were found between FRA, MIF or…
9823736	The effects of age on postprandial thermogenesis at four graded energetic challenges: findings in young and older women.	aging	1998-11-??	There remains controversy over the effect of age on postprandial thermogenesis, with some studies observing decreased postprandial thermogenesis in older subjects and other studies finding no effect of age. We investigated this issue in 8 young (25.2+/-1.8 years) and 8 older (72.2+/-2.1 years) healthy glucose-tolerant women with normal thyroid hormone status. Repeated measures of the thermic effect of feeding (TEF) were obtained following consumption of test meals containing 0, 1046, 2092, and 4184 kilojoules (kJ) by using indirect calorimetry. TEF at each meal size was determined once in the older subjects and twice in the younger subjects (during follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle) for a total of 96 measurements. There was a positive dose-response between meal size and TEF (p < .001) that was not significantly affected by age group. The best single predictor of TEF expressed as a percentage of meal energy content was waist-to-hip ratio (R2=67.416, p < .02). These res…
26306927	A voxel-based morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain detects age-related gray matter volume changes in healthy subjects of 21-45 years old.	aging	2015-10-??	Previous and more recent work of analyzing structural changes in the brain suggest that certain brain regions such as the frontal lobe are among the brain regions profoundly affected by the aging process across males and females. Also, a unified model of structural changes in a normally aging brain is still lacking. The present study investigated age-related structural brain changes in gray matter from young to early middle-age adulthood for males and females. Magnetic resonance images of 215 normal and healthy participants between the ages of 21-45 years were acquired. Changes in gray matter were assessed using voxel-based morphometry and gray matter volumetric analysis. The results showed significant decrease in gray matter volume between the youngest and oldest groups in the following brain regions: frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Grey matter loss in the frontal lobe was among the most widespread of all brain regions across the comparison groups that showed significant age-re…
27976953	Improving Psychosocial Well-Being of Older Adults Through Exergaming: The Moderation Effects of Intergenerational Communication and Age Cohorts.	aging	2016-12-??	OBJECTIVE: Exergaming is one way to foster social interaction among older adults and to improve their psychosocial well-being, which is a crucial component of healthy aging. This study examined how exergaming affects older adults' social anxiousness, sociability, and loneliness, and it further analyzed differences in the exergaming effects across different types of game play and between different aging cohorts.    METHOD: A 2 (pre-test vs. post-test) × 2 (young-old vs. old-old) × 3 (play alone vs. play with elderly vs. play with youths) mixed quasi-experiment (N = 89) was conducted in Singapore, and three-way MANOVAs were executed.    RESULTS: Results showed a significant three-way interaction effect among exergaming, play type, and age group on older adults' psychosocial well-being. There was a significant decline in social anxiousness and an increase in sociability for young-old participants playing with youths. The sociability improved significantly for old-old participants playing …
25650665	Age and metabolic risk factors associated with oxidatively damaged DNA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	aging	2015-02-20	Aging is associated with oxidative stress-generated damage to DNA and this could be related to metabolic disturbances. This study investigated the association between levels of oxidatively damaged DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and metabolic risk factors in 1,019 subjects, aged 18-93 years. DNA damage was analyzed as strand breaks by the comet assay and levels of formamidopyrimidine (FPG-) and human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1)-sensitive sites There was an association between age and levels of FPG-sensitive sites for women, but not for men. The same tendency was observed for the level of hOGG1-sensitive sites, whereas there was no association with the level of strand breaks. The effect of age on oxidatively damaged DNA in women disappeared in multivariate models, which showed robust positive associations between DNA damage and plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). In the group of men, there were significant positiv…
9502155	Validation of an HPLC method for the analysis of the charge heterogeneity of the recombinant monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 after papain digestion.	aging	1997-12-??	An HPLC procedure was validated for determining the purity with respect to the charge variant distribution of the recombinant monoclonal antibody (MAb) IDEC-C2B8 by high-performance ion-exchange chromatography. Papain was used to fragment the molecule into Fab and Fc fragments prior to chromatographic analysis. Fragmentation allowed the resolution of the variants arising from the cyclization of glutamine to pyroglutamate at the amino-terminus of the light and heavy chains (Fab-pE/Q variants) from the variants resulting from the processing of the carboxy-terminal lysine residues of the heavy chains (Fc-Lys variants). The assay demonstrated good linearity, yielding correlation coefficients of > 0.99 for total protein, Fc-Lys variants and Fab-pE/Q variants. Recovery of total protein from the column was 95.7%. Sample recovery studies demonstrated a mean accuracy of 102% for a Fab fragment over the range 2-10% of the total protein. The limit of detection was 0.2 microg and 0.1 microg for Fc…
20601917	Aging effect on the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials.	aging	2010-08-??	OBJECTIVE: This study applied ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) tests in healthy subjects of various ages to measure the effect of aging on oVEMPs quantitatively.    STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.    SETTING: University hospital.    SUBJECTS: Seventy healthy subjects with the ages ranging from 24 to 76 years were divided into 6 groups by decade. Each group consisted of 10 subjects in 1 decade except 20 subjects in the group of 60 to 69 years.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All subjects underwent oVEMP tests using bone-conducted vibration stimuli.    RESULTS: All subjects in groups of 20-59 years showed 100% response rates of clear oVEMPs, while 22 (55%) of 40 eyes in group of 60-69 years and 8 (40%) of 20 eyes in group of >or= 70 years had clear oVEMPs, exhibiting significant differences between those below and over 60 years of age. The mean nI and pI latencies also showed significantly prolonged in those over 60 years, whereas the mean nI-pI amplitude reduced significan…
22495928	Postnatal development- and age-related changes in DNA-methylation patterns in the human genome.	aging	2012-08-??	Alterations in DNA methylation have been reported to occur during development and aging; however, much remains to be learned regarding post-natal and age-associated epigenome dynamics, and few if any investigations have compared human methylome patterns on a whole genome basis in cells from newborns and adults. The aim of this study was to reveal genomic regions with distinct structure and sequence characteristics that render them subject to dynamic post-natal developmental remodeling or age-related dysregulation of epigenome structure. DNA samples derived from peripheral blood monocytes and in vitro differentiated dendritic cells were analyzed by methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) or, for selected loci, bisulfite modification, followed by next generation sequencing. Regions of interest that emerged from the analysis included tandem or interspersed-tandem gene sequence repeats (PCDHG, FAM90A, HRNR, ECEL1P2), and genes with strong homology to other family members elsewhere in th…
1549212	Electrophysiologic function in the healthy, extremely old.	aging	1992-03-??	We analyzed conventional EEG, computerized EEG frequency analysis (CEEGFA), and long-latency auditory evoked potentials in 22 extremely healthy subjects over age 84 (range, 84 to 98) and compared them with 11 younger elderly subjects as well as subjects under age 65 years. Intermittent temporal slowing in the conventional EEG was present in 50% of the elderly. Its presence was related to the presence of white matter hyperintensities on MRI but not to blood pressure or cognitive function. The posterior peak frequency determined by CEEGFA was maintained above 8 Hz in all subjects under age 84, but was between 7 and 8 Hz in five of 22 subjects over age 84 years. Three other CEEGFA variables studied (relative theta, relative alpha, and median-power frequency in the posterior channels) all demonstrated a significant change with age, most marked above age 80 years. Well-defined P3s were not present in five of 22 subjects over age 84 and in only one of 38 subjects under age 84 years. The P3 l…

OBJECTIVES: To document the extent of healthy aging along 10 different dimensions in a population known for its longevity.    DESIGN: A cohort study with baseline measures of overall self-reported health and health along 10 specific dimensions; analyses investigated the 10 dimensions as predictors of self-reported health and 10-year mortality.    SETTING: Cache County, Utah, which is among the areas with the highest conditional life expectancy at age 65 in the United States.    PARTICIPANTS: Inhabitants of Cache County aged 65 and older (January 1, 1995).    MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported overall health and 10 specific dimensions of healthy aging: independent living, vision, hearing, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, absence of physical illness, cognition, healthy mood, social support and participation, and religious participation and spirituality.    RESULTS: This elderly population was healthy overall. With few exceptions, 80% to 90% of persons aged 65…
16410052	Generality and specificity in cognitive aging: a volumetric brain analysis.	aging	2006-05-01	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in old age, brain volume differences are associated with age-related change in general mental ability and/or specific cognitive abilities.    METHODS: The authors investigate the association between brain volumes and current cognitive function in a well-characterized sample of healthy old people (aged 79-80) whose intelligence was recorded at age 11. This allowed estimation of intellectual change over the life span.    RESULTS: After accounting for childhood intelligence, associations were found between specific cognitive measures and brain volumes. An association was also found between volumes and the general intelligence factor g. After removing the influence of g from each of the specific cognitive measures, no remaining significant associations were found between brain volumes and the specific part of each test.    CONCLUSIONS: Generalized cognitive aging is associated with brain volume differences, but there is no evidence in this sample that spe…

15998340	Enzymic and non-enzymic cross-linking mechanisms in relation to turnover of collagen: relevance to aging and exercise.	aging	2005-08-??	The molecular mechanisms involved in the aging of collagen and consequent increase in mechanical strength and stiffness occur in a series of enzymic and non-enzymic intermolecular cross-links. The enzymic mechanism involves divalent aldimine intermolecular cross-links derived from the reaction of aldehydes which then mature to trivalent cross-links and further stabilize the collagen fiber and is now well known. Recent studies have demonstrated that the rate of turnover and level of telopeptide lysyl hydroxylation modifies the nature of the cross-link and hence the mechanical strength of the fiber. The slow turnover of mature collagen subsequently allows accumulation of the products of the adventitious non-enzymic reaction of glucose with the lysines in the triple helix to form glucosyl lysine and its Amadori product, that is, the Maillard reaction. These products are subsequently oxidized to a complex series of advanced glycation end-products, some of which are intermolecular cross-lin…
22564865	Age-dependent increase of memory B cell response to cytomegalovirus in healthy adults.	aging	2012-08-??	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) may play an important role in immune system aging, due to its ability to modulate the host immune system. A significant age-related increase has been demonstrated for HCMV-specific serum antibody levels but so far, no information exists whether and to which extent the magnitude of the HCMV-specific memory B cell response develops with increasing age. We examined the size of the HCMV-specific memory B cell response and assessed whether there are quantitative differences in HCMV-specific memory B cell numbers and serum antibody titers against HCMV in young and older persons. The quantities of HCMV-specific memory B cells were determined in 20 young (20-31 years) and 21 older (60-80 years) healthy volunteers by limiting dilution analysis. HCMV-specific antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. Our study demonstrates that higher HCMV-specific plasma antibody levels correlated well with the numbers of circulating HCMV-specific memory B cells and were not due to a …
11404654	Effects of age on muscle energy metabolism and oxygenation in the forearm muscles.	aging	2001-06-??	PURPOSE: The effects of aging on muscle metabolism and oxygenation have not yet been elucidated. We evaluated the effects of aging on energy metabolism and oxygenation in sedentary healthy subjects by simultaneously measuring 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).    METHODS: Nine young (28.1 +/- 5.0 yr) and nine older (61.4 +/- 4.6 yr) healthy subjects were studied. The 31P-MR spectrum was obtained every 15 s during and after hand gripping exercise. Intracellular pH (pHi) and PCr/(PCr+Pi) [PCr: phosphocreatine, Pi: inorganic phosphate] were calculated as an index of energy metabolism. The time constant of the PCr/(PCr+Pi) recovery (tau PCr) was calculated. With NIRS, we evaluated the recovery rates of oxygenated (RHbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (RHb) during the initial 10 s of recovery.    RESULTS: The PCr/(PCr+Pi) and pHi at rest and at completion of the exercise and tau PCr did not differ between young and older subjects. However, RHbO2 a…
11174090	Differences in the two-dimensionally measured laser Doppler flow at different skin localisations.	aging	????-??-??	The cutaneous microcirculation shows a significant heterogeneity. With high-resolution two-dimensional laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI), spatial and temporal reproducible perfusion measurements can be reached. The objective of this study was the quantification of skin perfusion in 20 defined skin areas with LDPI, in 60 healthy young and old volunteers. The perfusion of the face was significantly higher than that of the trunk and extremities. The highest perfusion values were seen at the lips, 1.47 arbitrary units (AU), followed by the chin (0.99 AU), the nose (0.95 AU), the forehead (0.73 AU) and the cheek (0.72 AU). Mean perfusion, between 0.40 and 0.49 AU, was seen at the extremities and at the trunk. The lowest perfusion was found at the bottom (0.37 AU), on the back of the foot (0.36 AU) and on the soles (0.31 AU). There was a tendency to show higher perfusion values in men than in women (0.60 +/- 0.31 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.26 AU). Age-related differences in perfusion could not be d…
10421600	Cardiac interbeat interval dynamics from childhood to senescence : comparison of conventional and new measures based on fractals and chaos theory.	aging	1999-07-27	BACKGROUND: New methods of R-R interval variability based on fractal scaling and nonlinear dynamics ("chaos theory") may give new insights into heart rate dynamics. The aims of this study were to (1) systematically characterize and quantify the effects of aging from early childhood to advanced age on 24-hour heart rate dynamics in healthy subjects; (2) compare age-related changes in conventional time- and frequency-domain measures with changes in newly derived measures based on fractal scaling and complexity (chaos) theory; and (3) further test the hypothesis that there is loss of complexity and altered fractal scaling of heart rate dynamics with advanced age.    METHODS AND RESULTS: The relationship between age and cardiac interbeat (R-R) interval dynamics from childhood to senescence was studied in 114 healthy subjects (age range, 1 to 82 years) by measurement of the slope, beta, of the power-law regression line (log power-log frequency) of R-R interval variability (10(-4) to 10(-2) …
11446770	Resistance of human betaB2-crystallin to in vivo modification.	aging	2001-08-??	Post-translational modifications and/or structural changes induced by modifications are likely causes of the decrease in crystallin solubility associated with aging and the development of cataract. Characterization of human lens crystallins by mass spectrometry has demonstrated that betaB2-crystallin undergoes less modification than any of the other crystallins. As the lens ages, betaB2-crystallin retains its hydrophilic N-terminus while the hydrophilic C-termini of alpha-crystallins and large portions of the N-termini of betaA3/A1 and betaB1 are truncated. The hydrophilic terminal regions of crystallins contribute to their solubility. Furthermore, deamidation and disulfide bond formation, other modifications that may affect solubility by altering conformation, are less extensive in betaB2 than in the other crystallins. This resistance to modification results in higher levels of betaB2 compared with the other crystallins in the water-soluble fraction of older lenses. The solubility of …
16541609	Plasma antioxidant status in healthy smoking and non-smoking men.	aging	2005-??-??	Human serum contains many different antioxidants which may be important in the maintenance of an antioxidant status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between lipid peroxidation and total plasma antioxidant capacity in healthy smoking and non-smoking young and elderly subjects. Plasma concetrations of alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene and ascorbic acid were detected by HPLC. Additionally, in the in vitro experiments, the effects of exogenous compounds (ascorbic acid, uric acid, Trolox) on total ferric reducing activity of plasma were tested. We demonstrated that total antioxidant capacity of plasma obtained from healthy non-smoking young subjects was significantly higher than plasma antioxidant capacity of smoking elderly subjects. The concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (p < 0.001) in young non-smoking volunteers was lower than that in young smokers. The concentration of TBARS in elderly non-smoking volunteers was lower than in elderly s…
14562168	Senescent effects on binocular summation for contrast sensitivity and spatial interval acuity.	aging	2003-11-??	PURPOSE: Age effects on binocular summation, a cortically mediated visual function, were compared for resolution acuity, contrast sensitivity (CS), and spatial interval (SI) hyperacuity.    METHOD: The binocular and monocular thresholds of healthy, optimally-corrected healthy young (mean age 21.3 years) and old (mean age 69.9 years) observers were determined for acuity, SI discrimination, and CS at 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 18.0 c/deg.    RESULTS: No age effects were observed on monocular or binocular SI discrimination. The binocular summation ratios (BSRs) did not exceed the expected probability gain for resolution acuity or SI discrimination in either age group. Older observers showed a binocular inhibition effect on the SI task. On the CS task, the BSRs of the young significantly exceeded those of the old only at 18.0 c/deg.    CONCLUSIONS: 1.) Binocular summation of high spatial frequency contrast information, which may be less robust in the senescent visual system, did not appear to …
30726348	Social network and older people's functionality: Health, Well-being, and Aging (SABE) study evidences.	aging	2019-02-04	INTRODUCTION: Possessing active social networks seems to positively influence the functional performance of elderly people.    OBJECTIVE: To verify the association between the characteristics of social networks of the elderly people and the emergence of functional impairment.    METHODS: This is a longitudinal population-based study, which used the 2006 (n = 1,413) and 2010 (n = 990) cohorts of the Health, Well-Being, and Aging (SABE) Study. To characterize the social networks, the following variables were used: number of members in the network; living arrangements; sex and age of the members; coresidence with children or only elderly individuals; satisfaction with the relationships; and receiving and offering social support (financial, material, emotional, performing tasks inside and outside the home, providing companionship, and personal care). Logistic regression was used to analyze the data. All ethical guidelines were followed.    RESULTS: The social networks of the elderly people…
8085434	Cerebrospinal fluid production and dynamics in normal aging: a MRI phase-mapping study.	aging	1994-05-??	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phase mapping was used for non-invasive evaluation of the to-and-fro motion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cerebral aqueduct, and to measure the supratentorial CSF production in vivo, in 13 healthy volunteers to determine whether normal aging affects these parameters. Eight young healthy volunteers (mean age 29.8 years) and five elderly healthy volunteers (mean age 69.0 years) were examined, all were normal on conventional MRI. Slightly higher aqueductal CSF peak flow velocities and peak volume flow in both the caudal and rostral directions were found in the group of elderly healthy volunteers, however, this was not statistically significant. The calculated mean supratentorial CSF production rates in the two groups were almost identical, corresponding to approximately 900-1000 ml per 24 h, we suggest that supratentorial CSF production in healthy humans in fact occurs at this relatively high rate. Our study further suggests that the differences foun…
30570174	Aging in high functioning elderly persons: study design and analyses of behavioral and psychological factors.	aging	2019-04-??	This article aims to (a) describe the study design of a 6-year follow-up multidisciplinary research project on aging, (b) report the psychosocial characteristics of the sample in detail, and (c) evaluate aging-related changes of health, physical activity, and psychosocial characteristics in 10 young-old (age at pre-test: M ± SD = 63.2 ± 1.5) and 12 old-old (age at pre-test: M ± SD = 69 ± 2) individuals. Both age groups consist of individuals displaying a high health status, a high extent of physical activity, high levels of psychosocial properties in the dimensions of well-being, life satisfaction, self-concept, body image, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, as well as a low general depression index. Psychosocial characteristics demonstrated a stable pattern over a period of nearly 6 years in both age groups with the exceptions of physical activity, satisfaction with children, general depression, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, physical self-concept decreased in old-old adults, whereas th…
22449457	The effects of aging, physical training, and a single bout of exercise on mitochondrial protein expression in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2012-06-??	Aging results in a significant decline in aerobic capacity and impaired mitochondrial function. We have tested the effects of moderate physical activity on aerobic capacity and a single bout of exercise on the expression profile of mitochondrial biogenesis, and fusion and fission related genes in skeletal muscle of human subjects. Physical activity attenuated the aging-associated decline in VO2 max (p<0.05). Aging increased and a single exercise bout decreased the expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1), while the transcription factor A (TFAM) expression showed a strong relationship with VO(2max) and increased significantly in the young physically active group. Mitochondrial fission representing FIS1 was induced by regular physical activity, while a bout of exercise decreased fusion-associated gene expression. The expression of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) changed inversely in young and old groups and decreased with aging. The A2 subunit of cyclic AMP-activated prote…
27063513	Bioenergetics of the aging heart and skeletal muscles: Modern concepts and controversies.	aging	2016-??-??	Age-related alterations in the bioenergetics of the heart and oxidative skeletal muscle tissues are of crucial influence on their performance. Until now the prevailing concept of aging was the mitochondrial theory, the increased production of reactive oxygen species, mediated by deficiency in the activity of respiratory chain complexes. However, studies with mitochondria in situ have presented results which, to some extent, disagree with previous ones, indicating that the mitochondrial theory of aging may be overestimated. The studies reporting age-related decline in mitochondrial function were performed using mainly isolated mitochondria. Measurements on this level are not able to take into account the system level properties. The relevant information can be obtained only from appropriate studies using cells or tissue fibers. The functional interactions between the components of Intracellular Energetic Unit (ICEU) regulate the energy production and consumption in oxidative muscle cell…
17274684	Efficiency and cost of economical brain functional networks.	aging	2007-02-02	Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task or "resting" state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age…
28017139	Sumoylation in Cellular Senescence and Aging.	aging	2017-??-??	Sumoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that conjugates small peptide SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) to a target protein. Global protein sumoylation and expression of components in sumoylation pathway were recently found to be altered in the process of organismal aging. In addition, key factors controlling cellular senescence are known to be sumoylated. This review will summarize current information on the function of sumoylation in cellular senescence and aging.
27813509	The happy elderly as a being-toward-death: a phenomenological research.	aging	2016-10-12	INTRODUCTION: Little research has been done on elderly adults from an optimistic perspective. What is it like to be a happy elderly person who is moving toward death? How can we approach their health promotion? This study aimed at exploring ways of being happy in older adults in Chile.    METHODS: We used a phenomenological approach, using Martin Heideggers philosophical frame. Participants were chosen after applying the Lyubomirski scale  those who fell into the happy category were invited to a semi-structured interview.    RESULTS: We identified categories in happy elderly people; such as being autonomous, traveling, dancing, childcare, reading, pets, enjoy material goods. Thus, being able to understand the happy elderly person as being placed in the world without any choice other than accepting life and death as best as possible, with an optimistic regard about the past, an ability to reinvent themselves, and an awareness of being closer to death.    CONCLUSIONS: There is still …
16222400	Heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability: the impact of thinness and aging in human male subjects.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Life spans are steadily increasing in developing countries where 'thinness' is widely prevalent. However, the interaction of aging and thinness has been poorly studied in terms of its physiological consequences.    OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of aging and 'thinness' (body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2) on resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability indices in the frequency domain.    SUBJECTS: Ninety seven healthy male subjects were divided into two age categories; young; 18-30 yrs and old superior 60 yrs. The subjects were further divided on the basis of BMI into young, thin (n=32), young, normal BMI (BMI 18.5-25, n = 27), old, thin (n = 15) and old, normal BMI (n = 23) groups.    METHODS: Cardiac autonomic nerve function was determined using heart rate variability indices in the frequency domain (low frequency, cardiac sympathetic 0.04- 0.15 Hz; high frequency, cardiac parasympathetic 0.15-0.4 Hz). Vasomotor sympathetic activity was determined …
11509534	Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men.	aging	2001-09-??	The purpose of this study was to determine whether the loss of muscle strength in the elderly could be explained entirely by a decline in the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of muscle. Isometric force, muscle activation (twitch interpolation), and coactivation (surface electromyograph) were measured during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the elbow flexors (EFs) and extensors (EEs) in 20 young (23 +/- 3 yr) and 13 older (81 +/- 6 yr) healthy men. PCSA was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, and normalized force (NF) was calculated as the MVC/PCSA ratio. The PCSA was smaller in the old compared with the young men, more so in the EEs (28%) compared with the EFs (19%) (P < 0.001); however, the decline in MVC (approximately 30%) with age was similar in the two muscle groups. Muscle activation was not different between the groups, but coactivation was greater (5%) (P < 0.001) in the old men for both muscles. NF was less (11%) in the EFs (P < 0.01) and tended to be…
8688670	Regulation of CD95 (APO-1) expression and the induction of apoptosis in human T cells: changes in old age.	aging	1996-07-??	CD95 (APO-1) is a member of the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily, which is expressed on the surface of different types of cells. Cross-linking of CD95 leads to the induction of apoptosis. This may be of importance in many physiological systems, but seems to play a special role for the maintenance of immunological homeostasis. In view of the known decline of immune function in old age it seemed of interest to study the expression and inducibility of CD95 in peripheral blood T lymphocytes from young and old healthy subjects selected according to the guidelines laid down in the Senieur protocol of the European Community's Concerted Action Programme on Aging. Resting T cells did not express CD95. T cell activation by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) did, however, lead to a rapid increase in the number of CD95 expressing cells. This increase was slower and less pronounced in old healthy subjects than in young ones. The activation-induced increase in CD95 expression was follow…
3391094	Glycosylation of proteins. Lack of influence of aging.	aging	1988-05-??	In elderly nondiabetic individuals, increased glycosylation of hemoglobin has been reported. Most elderly subjects suffer from chronic disorders and consume one or more medications. Thus, it is conceivable that the increased glycosylation of hemoglobin may be secondary to factors other than old age. Furthermore, the data are sparse regarding the effect of aging on glycosylation of other proteins. In this study, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), glycosylated protein (GP), glycosylated albumin (GA), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations were determined in 93 healthy nondiabetic subjects after an overnight fast. Strict criteria were observed to define the healthy status of these subjects to eliminate the influence of all other factors known to facilitate glycosylation of hemoglobin. No significant correlations were noted between age and FPG, GHb, GP, or GA (P greater than .05 for all correlations). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between groups according to ag…
8548496	Age-related dynamics of cognitive brain functions in humans: an electrophysiological approach.	aging	1996-01-??	Event-related P300 potentials closely reflect cognitive functions such as stimulus discrimination (N250) and processing time (P300 latencies) as well as attention capabilities (P300 amplitudes). To delineate the age-related dynamics of P300 potentials, we investigated 250 healthy subjects between 18 and 98 years of age in a cross-sectional study. A total of 330 visual P300 tests was performed in two different paradigms (PI, passive condition, n = 80; PII, active condition, n = 250). In both P300 paradigms, the N250 and P300 latencies were markedly prolonged (p < .0001) in older age, whereas the N250 and P300 latency differences between PII and PI did not change (p > .05). The P300 amplitudes in paradigm I and II revealed only a slight age-related reduction. In fact, the P300 amplitude ratios between PII and PI remained constant. Third-order polynomial regressions provided the best fit of the aging-P300 interactions in paradigms I and II for both males and females. Interestingly, female…
24014150	Improved identification and relative quantification of sites of peptide and protein oxidation for hydroxyl radical footprinting.	aging	2013-11-??	Protein oxidation is typically associated with oxidative stress and aging and affects protein function in normal and pathological processes. Additionally, deliberate oxidative labeling is used to probe protein structure and protein-ligand interactions in hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF). Oxidation often occurs at multiple sites, leading to mixtures of oxidation isomers that differ only by the site of modification. We utilized sets of synthetic, isomeric "oxidized" peptides to test and compare the ability of electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision-induced dissociation (CID), as well as nano-ultra high performance liquid chromatography (nanoUPLC) separation, to quantitate oxidation isomers with one oxidation at multiple adjacent sites in mixtures of peptides. Tandem mass spectrometry by ETD generates fragment ion ratios that accurately report on relative oxidative modification extent on specific sites, regardless of the charge state of the precursor ion. Conversely…
16884442	Effect of age and education on the Trail Making Test and determination of normative data for Japanese elderly people: the Tajiri Project.	aging	2006-08-??	The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a common two-part neuropsychological test, in which visuospatial ability (TMT-A) and executive function (TMT-B) are evaluated. Normative data for this test have not been reported for Japanese subjects; therefore, the purpose of the present paper was to investigate the effect of age and education on the TMT in 155 healthy elderly adults with clinical dementia rating 0 (healthy). The participants were classified into three groups based on age (70-74 years, 75-84 years and >or=85 years), and also into three groups based on educational level (6 years, 8 years and >or=10 years). The time to complete TMT-A and TMT-B were measured, and the difference in score between TMT-A and TMT-B (B-A) and the ratio of the score (B/A) were calculated as indices of executive function. The time for completion of both parts of the TMT increased markedly in the >or=85-years group. For TMT-A, there was a significant difference between the 6-years and 8-years groups, and between th…
8820031	The liver biochemical tests and serological markers of hepatitis B virus in the very old-aged population in Taiwan.	aging	1996-01-??	BACKGROUND: Human liver alters with aging. Lower serum albumin with elevation in serum cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been reported in the elders, but there was no further report on the very old people (i.e., >75 Y/O). We evaluated changes of liver biochemical tests and hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological markers in the very old-aged population.    METHODS: From October 1993 to June 1994, 2,549 subjects attended our hospital for physical check-up. Of them 1,742 were healthy subjects (M/F = 1,058/648) and were enrolled for analysis of the normal range of liver biochemical tests in different age groups. They were divided into four groups; young-aged group (age between 18 and 40, n = 231), middle-aged group (age between 41 and 64, n = 991), old-aged group (age between 65 and 75, n = 424), and very old-aged group (age > or = 76, n = 96). The items of liver biochemical tests included albumin, total bilirubin, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransf…
20157551	Tissue- and age-dependent expression of RNA-binding proteins that influence mRNA turnover and translation.	aging	2009-07-26	Gene expression patterns vary dramatically in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. RNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA turnover and/or translation (TTR-RBPs) critically affect the subsets of expressed proteins. However, very little is known regarding the tissue- and age-dependent expression of TTR-RBPs in humans. Here, we use human tissue arrays containing a panel of organ biopsies from donors of different ages, to study the distribution and abundance of four TTR-RBPs: HuR, AUF1, TIA-1, and TTP. HuR and AUF1 were expressed with remarkably similar patterns. Both TTR-RBPs were present in high percentages of cells and displayed elevated intensities in many age groups and tissues, most notably in the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems; they were moderately expressed in the urinary and immune systems, and were almost undetectable in muscle and brain. TIA-1 was also abundant in many tissues and age groups; TIA-1 was expressed at high levels in the gastrointestinal, immune, …
21253879	Aging reduces complexity of heart rate variability assessed by conditional entropy and symbolic analysis.	aging	2012-06-??	Increasing age is associated with a reduction in overall heart rate variability as well as changes in complexity of physiologic dynamics. The aim of this study was to verify if the alterations in autonomic modulation of heart rate caused by the aging process could be detected by Shannon entropy (SE), conditional entropy (CE) and symbolic analysis (SA). Complexity analysis was carried out in 44 healthy subjects divided into two groups: old (n = 23, 63 ± 3 years) and young group (n = 21, 23 ± 2). It was analyzed SE, CE [complexity index (CI) and normalized CI (NCI)] and SA (0V, 1V, 2LV and 2ULV patterns) during short heart period series (200 cardiac beats) derived from ECG recordings during 15 min of rest in a supine position. The sequences characterized by three heart periods with no significant variations (0V), and that with two significant unlike variations (2ULV) reflect changes in sympathetic and vagal modulation, respectively. The unpaired t test (or Mann-Whitney rank sum test when…

Energetics, biomechanics, and performance in masters' swimmers: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 2069-2081, 2016-This study aimed to summarize evidence on masters' swimmers energetics, biomechanics, and performance gathered in selected studies. An expanded search was conducted on 6 databases, conference proceedings, and department files. Fifteen studies were selected for further analysis. A qualitative evaluation of the studies based on the Quality Index (QI) was performed by 2 independent reviewers. The studies were thereafter classified into 3 domains according to the reported data: performance (10 studies), energetics (4 studies), and biomechanics (6 studies). The selected 15 articles included in this review presented low QI scores (mean score, 10.47 points). The biomechanics domain obtained higher QI (11.5 points), followed by energetics and performance (10.6 and 9.9 points, respectively). Stroke frequ…
20303404	Preservation of eccentric strength in older adults: Evidence, mechanisms and implications for training and rehabilitation.	aging	2010-06-??	Overall reductions in muscle strength typically accompany the aging process. However, older adults show a relatively preserved capacity of producing eccentric strength. The preservation of eccentric strength in older adults is a well-established phenomenon, occurring indiscriminately across different muscle groups, independent of age-related architectural changes in muscle structure and velocity of movement. The mechanisms for the preservation of eccentric strength appear to be mechanical and cellular in origin and include both passive and active elements regulating muscle stiffness. The age-related accumulation of non-contractile material in the muscle-tendon unit increases passive stiffness, which might offer mechanical advantage during eccentric contractions. In addition, the preserved muscle tension and increased instantaneous stiffness of old muscle fibers during stretch increase active stiffness, which might enhance eccentric strength. The fact that the preservation of eccentric …
26272993	Causal mediation analysis for longitudinal data with exogenous exposure.	aging	2016-01-??	Mediation analysis is a valuable approach to examine pathways in epidemiological research. Prospective cohort studies are often conducted to study biological mechanisms and often collect longitudinal measurements on each participant. Mediation formulae for longitudinal data have been developed. Here, we formalize the natural direct and indirect effects using a causal framework with potential outcomes that allows for an interaction between the exposure and the mediator. To allow different types of longitudinal measures of the mediator and outcome, we assume two generalized mixed-effects models for both the mediator and the outcome. The model for the mediator has subject-specific random intercepts and random exposure slopes for each cluster, and the outcome model has random intercepts and random slopes for the exposure, the mediator, and their interaction. We also expand our approach to settings with multiple mediators and derive the mediated effects, jointly through all mediators. Our m…
12759161	Melatonin excretion with affect disorders over age 60.	aging	2003-05-01	Numerous studies have reported low melatonin secretion in depression, but other studies have suggested no deficit or an increase. Alterations of circadian phase or duration of melatonin secretion have also been described. Since melatonin secretion decreases as we age, it seemed interesting to examine melatonin and depression in an aging sample. Volunteers who complained of mood or sleep problems were recruited for studies in which fractional urine specimens were collected for 24 h, both at home and in the laboratory. The major metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), was determined by radioimmunoassay. Of 72 volunteers aged 60-78 years, seven had current major depression and 55% had a lifetime history of an affective disorder. A 55-fold range of home aMT6s excretion rates was observed. A lifetime history of any affective disorder was significantly associated with greater log(10)[mesor] aMT6s excretion in home collections and laboratory collections, but current affective disorders were…
30348084	Paternal germ line aging: DNA methylation age prediction from human sperm.	aging	2018-10-22	BACKGROUND: The relationship between aging and epigenetic profiles has been highlighted in many recent studies. Models using somatic cell methylomes to predict age have been successfully constructed. However, gamete aging is quite distinct and as such age prediction using sperm methylomes is ineffective with current techniques.    RESULTS: We have produced a model that utilizes human sperm DNA methylation signatures to predict chronological age by utilizing methylation array data from a total of 329 samples. The dataset used for model construction includes infertile patients, sperm donors, and individuals from the general population. Our model is capable predicting age with an R2 of 0.89, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.04 years, and a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 6.28% in our data set. We additionally investigated the reproducibility of prediction with our model in an independent cohort where 6 technical replicates of 10 individual samples were tested on different arrays. We…

The present study was carried out in the department of physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh during the period of July 2004 to June 2005 to estimate basal cortisol level in healthy aged persons and to explore association between aging and antiaging and adreno cortical status. A total number of 60 healthy subjects aged 60 and above 60 years old were included in this study. Twenty three (23) normal healthy subjects of aged 20-30 years were taken as control group. Estimation of serum cortisol level of both study and control group was done by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in centre for nuclear medicine and ultrasound, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS program using unpaired students't' test between two groups. The results showed that there is no statistically significant difference in mean serum cortisol level of study group when compare to control group. The study depicts that subjects possessed better adre…
16313945	CD8 T-cell immune phenotype of successful aging.	aging	2006-03-??	The nonagenarian population by definition represents individuals who have demonstrated success in aging. We determined the status of CD8(+) T-cell senescence in nonagenarians by analyzing the expression of CD28 and Fas (CD95), and analyzing activation and activation-induced cell death (AICD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three groups of subjects: adults (20-64-year-old), older adults (65-89-year-old), and nonagenarians (>or=90-year-old). PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (10 microg/ml). The cells were labeled with conjugated antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, CD28, CD45RO, and Fas, and were analyzed by FACS((R)). There was a strong negative correlation of the percentage of CD28(+)Fas(-) CD8(+) T-cells with the age of each individual prior to stimulation in vitro (R(2)=0.76, p<0.0001). Compared to other biomarkers (CD28(-), CD28(-)CD45RO(+), and Fas(+)) that have been associated with CD8(+) T-cell aging, the loss of the CD28(+)Fas(-) CD8…
22803113	Role of peptides in epigenetic regulation of gene activities in ontogeny.	lifespan, aging	2012-02-??	The authors develop a new concept most fully reflecting the evolutional and biological role of peptides in the organism. Wide spectrum of peptide effects realized through regulation of the expression of certain genes is aimed at the maintenance of homeostasis, inhibition of the genetic aging program realization, and lifespan prolongation.
3230490	Foveal flicker sensitivity in healthy aging eyes. I. Compensating for pupil variation.	aging	1988-12-??	Photopic temporal contrast sensitivity for healthy eyes of observers 65 years old and older is compared with retinal-illuminance-matched sensitivity of younger eyes. The older observers are significantly less sensitive for frequencies between 10 and 45 Hz. Although there is a slight shift to slower flicker rates in the mean contrast sensitivity function for older observers, this trend is not statistically significant, suggesting that there is relatively little loss of temporal resolving power of the visual system with healthy aging. These are preliminary results from an ongoing study of temporal contrast sensitivity in healthy aging eyes.
12468370	Lack of adaptation to severe malnutrition in elderly patients.	aging	2002-12-??	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sarcopenia is a common feature in the healthy elderly. However, little is known on age-related modifications of body composition in malnourished patients. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to evaluate the effects of aging per se on body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE) in malnourished patients.    METHODS: Ninety-seven non-stressed patients referred for chronic malnutrition (C-reactive protein <5 mg/l) were separated into two groups: middle-aged (26 female, 19 male, 48+/-15 yr), and elderly (26 female, 26 male, 79+/-6 yr). Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis and REE by indirect calorimetry.    RESULTS: In middle-aged patients, body composition remained stable between moderate (body-mass index [BMI; in kg/m(2)] 16-18.5) and severe (BMI < 16) malnutrition, with similar values of fat-free mass (FFM), body cell mass (BCM) and fat mass (FM) as percentages of body weight, whereas in elderly patients malnutrition occur…
7270459	Effect of aging on the electrocardiogram.	aging	1981-09-??	Previous cross-sectional population studies have shown age differences in electrocardiographic wave patterns, including lower wave amplitudes and a leftward shift of the frontal plane axis in older people. However, cross-sectional results may be due to cohort differences and the data imply only that these changes actually occur in persons as they age. In order to examine electrocardiographic changes with aging in the same persons, serial recordings, obtained 10 years apart, were taken in 440 healthy male participants of the Normative Aging Study, who were 23 to 66 years old on their first examination. At examination 1, R and S wave amplitudes were smaller and frontal plane axis measurements were shifted to the left in older men. Longitudinal changes in these same variables were consistent with the cross-sectional results. In addition, the P-R and Q-T interval durations were longer, the QRS duration was shorter and the T wave amplitude was smaller at the second examination. The longitud…
1618934	Vibration-induced regional cerebral blood flow responses in normal aging.	aging	1992-07-??	Task-induced changes in regional CBF (rCBF) can be measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and provide a powerful tool to map brain function. Many studies using these techniques have investigated responses in healthy young subjects. Since many pathological conditions occur more commonly in older subjects, it is necessary to compare blood flow responses in these patients with appropriately age-matched controls. Furthermore, the effects of normal aging on such blood flow responses remain unknown. For both reasons, we designed this study to determine whether vibration-induced CBF responses change with advancing age in normals. CBF was measured with PET and bolus-administered H2(15)O in 26 subjects from 20 to 72 years old (mean = 39; SD = 19). Regional responses were identified by subtraction-image analysis. Left and right hand vibration produced consistent responses in contralateral primary sensorimotor area (PSA) and supplementary motor area (SMA). Response magnitudes were compa…
8382290	Factors influencing cortisol-adrenocorticotrophin relationships in elderly women with upper femur fractures.	aging	1993-01-??	In elderly women with proximal femur fractures, plasma cortisol levels are still elevated 2 weeks after injury. We have now measured the concentrations of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and its precursor peptides (pro-opiomelanocortin plus pro-ACTH) in blood samples obtained in the morning and afternoon from such patients and from old and young control subjects. In healthy subjects, aging had no effect on these variables. Compared with healthy elderly women, the injured women had elevated cortisol but not ACTH concentrations; at both times of day their precursor peptide concentration was increased but probably not enough to affect cortisol secretion substantially. There were no correlations between the concentrations of cortisol, ACTH, and precursor peptides. We have also studied adrenocortical sensitivity after giving dexamethasone overnight. The cortisol responses to graded doses of ACTH did not differ between injured and healthy elderly women, suggesting that their higher cortisol conc…
2765206	Active and passive mobility of lower limb joints in elderly men and women.	aging	1989-08-??	An age associated decline in joint mobility during the early and middle adult years is well documented, however, little information exists on the progress of this aspect of joint function during old age. Active and passive ranges of 10 lower limb joint motions were measured in 80 healthy, active men and women aged from 70 years, to examine the relationship between the capacity for joint movement and age, gender, and type of motion. Joint mobility declined consistently as age increased, with women generally having greater movement capability than their male peers. The predominant trend was for a more rapid reduction in mobility during the ninth decade. Passive ranges were larger than those produced actively, and the pattern of change in both measurement modes was parallel over the age range. It is hypothesized that the consistent decline in mobility indicates the importance of biological aging of articular structures as a primary cause of increasing resistance to movement, while environ…
24243396	Exercise-training-induced changes in metabolic capacity with age: the role of central cardiovascular plasticity.	aging	2014-04-??	Although aging is typically associated with a decline in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), young and old subjects, of similar initial muscle metabolic capacity, increased quadriceps VO2max equally when this small muscle mass was trained in isolation. As it is unclear if this preserved exercise-induced plasticity with age is still evident with centrally challenging whole body exercise, we assessed maximal exercise responses in 13 young (24 ± 2 years) and 13 old (60 ± 3 years) males, matched for cycling VO2max (3.82 ± 0.66 and 3.69 ± 0.30 L min(-1), respectively), both before and after 8 weeks of high aerobic intensity cycle exercise training. As a consequence of the training both young and old significantly improved VO2max (13 ± 6 vs. 6 ± 7 %) and maximal power output (20 ± 6 vs. 10 ± 6 %, respectively) from baseline, however, the young exhibited a significantly larger increase than the old. Similarly, independently assessed maximal cardiac output (Q max) tended to increase more in t…
7715624	Sympathetic sudomotor function and aging.	aging	1995-04-??	Many studies have reported the influence of aging on different portions of the autonomic nervous system components but only partially for the sympathetic cholinergic system. We evaluated postganglionic sudomotor function in 196 healthy subjects, 104 women and 92 men, by determining sweat gland density (SGD) per square centimeter of skin, on the dorsum of the hand and foot, with the impression mold technique. The age range was from 5 to 84 years. A significant decrease of SGD was observed in both hand and foot in relation to age (P < 0.001). The ANOVA analysis of foot data shows that age is the only significant factor for SGD reduction. In the hand, both sex and body surface area are significant covariates with age. The dorsum of the foot is the most appropriate place to examine sweating in studies of aging. The lower normal limits for SGD in the foot are 213/cm2 for subjects younger than 30 years, 199/cm2 for those from 30 to 59 years, and 123/cm2 for subjects over 59 years old.
6526034	Endurance capacity of trained older aged athletes.	aging	1984-11-??	Seven older cyclists (mean age 66.9 years) still engaged in severe endurance training (mean = 8114.3 km year-1) were examined medically, echocardiographically and they underwent a maximal stress test on a bicycle. Mean maximal values were VO2,max = 44.7 ml, Wmax = 261.4 and heart rate = 157.4 beats min-1. The heart volume/max O2-pulse ratio (mean = 46.1) and the TEDD/max O2-pulse ratio (mean = 3.37) were lower compared with age related untrained persons and demonstrate therefore the strong correlation between heart size and function in healthy older aged athletes. Parameters at the anaerobic threshold (lactate concentration 4 mmol l-1) and at the individual anaerobic threshold (lactate concentration 4.08 mmol l-1) showed no significant difference: for heart rate, mean = 133.7; and for W, mean 182.7. The relative oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (mean = 77%/VO2,max) reflect a high endurance capacity of trained old persons, which enables those athletes to outstanding trainin…
10048631	Maximal and explosive force production capacity and balance performance in men of different ages.	aging	1999-02-??	A group of 32 healthy men (M) divided into three different age groups, i.e. M20 years [mean 21 (SD 1); n = 12], M40 [mean 40 (SD 2); n = 10] and M70 [mean 71 (SD 5); n = 10] volunteered as subjects for examination of maximal and explosive force production of leg extensor muscles in both isometric and dynamic actions (squat jump, SJ and counter movement jump, CMJ, and standing long-jump, SLJ). The balance test was performed on a force platform in both isometric and dynamic actions. Maximal bilateral isometric force value in M70 was lower (P < 0.001) than in M40 and as much as 46% lower (P < 0.001) than that recorded in M20 (P < 0.001). The maximal rate of force development (RFD) on the force-time curve was in M70 lower (P < 0.001) than in M40 and as much as 64% lower than in M20. The heights in SJ and CMJ and the distance in SLJ in M70 were lower (P < 0.001) than in M40 and M20 (P < 0.001). In response to modifications of the visual surroundings the older subjects were 24%-47% (P < 0.05…
10624453	Evolution of lumbar bone mineral content during adolescence and adulthood: a longitudinal study in 395 healthy females 10-24 years of age and 206 premenopausal women.	aging	1999-??-??	In a longitudinal study of 395 normal 10- to 24-year-old female volunteers, 105 of whom were initially premenarcheal, lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at inclusion and after a 2-year interval. The mean age of menarche was 13.1 +/- 1.1 years (n = 395). In a multiple regression analysis the BMD and BMC relative gains were highly correlated with the height and weight relative gains and with the time since menarche (r = 0.91 and r = 0.93, respectively). The mean relative annual increments in body height, in L2-4 vertebral height, in BMD and in BMC peaked respectively at 1.5, 1.0, 0.6 and 0.7 years before menarche. The four perimenarcheal years, beginning with the first pubertal clinical signs, are essential for bone acquisition, since 46.7% of adult BMC is acquired during this period. Two years after menarche, BMC is 85% of the adult value. Seven years after menarche no further significant variation in BMC is observ…
25101709	Aging related changes in mixed basal saliva concentration of sodium, potassium and chloride in healthy non medicated humans.	aging	2014-??-??	It is well known that the salivary flow is reduced by aging but ionic composition changes associated to aging have been less evaluated. To measure salivary and plasmatic [Na(+)], [K(+)] and [Cl(-)] and to correlate with age in healthy, non-medicated subjects of any gender, 165 healthy participating subjects (over 15 years old) were asked to give sample of 5 mL mix basal saliva in a plastic vial without any stimulation technique, additionally, 5 mL of venous blood was collected. Samples [Na(+)] and [K(+)] were measured by flame photometry (Corning™ M-405) and [Cl(-)] by voltametric chlorometry (Corning™ M-920). Ionic concentrations were expressed as (X±DE; meq.L⁻¹). All three ionic concentrations progressively increased with age, with the lineal regression equation being: [Na(+)] mEq=17.76 + 0.26(Age); r=+0.42; F=31.5; P=0.00001; [K(+)] mEq=13.2+0.15(Age); r=+0.32; F=16.5; P=0.00001; [Cl(-)] mEq=9.05+0.18(Age); r=+0.35; F=7.8; P=0.0071. Age induced changes in salivary ionic concentratio…
23108448	The effects of age and education on executive functioning and oral naming performance in greek cypriot adults: the neurocognitive study for the aging.	aging	2012-??-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Age, educational experiences, language and culture can affect linguistic-cognitive performance. This is the first systematic study investigating linguistic-cognitive aging in Greek Cypriot adults focusing on executive functioning (EF) and oral naming performance.    METHOD: Three hundred and fifty-nine participants were included, a group of young-old, aged 60-75 years (n = 231), and a group of old-old participants, aged 76 years and older (n = 128). Participants in each age group were divided into three education groups: 0-4 years (n = 50), 5-9 years (n = 198), and 10 years of education and higher (n = 111). Participants were administered 5 measures of EF along with measures of receptive vocabulary and confrontational naming.    RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between the EF composite score and all language measures. MANOVA (α = 0.05) indicated significant age and education effects on most measures of EF and language. Performance on receptive vocabulary a…
19084511	When does walking alter thinking? Age and task associated findings.	aging	2009-02-09	Age-associated changes in gait are exacerbated when another task is performed simultaneously. We quantified the converse, i.e., the effects of walking on cognitive abilities, and determined the role of aging and executive function (EF) in any observed changes. 276 healthy older adults and 52 healthy young adults performed three cognitive tasks, i.e., serial 7 and 3 subtractions and phoneme-monitoring, while sitting and again while walking. Among the elderly, walking decreased performance on serial 3 and 7 subtractions and the number of phonemes counted (p<0.0001), but enhanced content recall. In contrast, for the young adults, walking did not alter serial 3 subtractions, phoneme-monitoring or content recall, while serial 7 subtraction performance decreased during walking (p=0.047). Measures of EF explained the age-associated changes in performance of the cognitive task during walking. Findings in both young and old subjects underscore the idea that gait is attention-demanding and is no…
21818377	Correlations among brain gray matter volumes, age, gender, and hemisphere in healthy individuals.	aging	2011-??-??	To determine the relationship between age and gray matter structure and how interactions between gender and hemisphere impact this relationship, we examined correlations between global or regional gray matter volume and age, including interactions of gender and hemisphere, using a general linear model with voxel-based and region-of-interest analyses. Brain magnetic resonance images were collected from 1460 healthy individuals aged 20-69 years; the images were linearly normalized and segmented and restored to native space for analysis of global gray matter volume. Linearly normalized images were then non-linearly normalized and smoothed for analysis of regional gray matter volume. Analysis of global gray matter volume revealed a significant negative correlation between gray matter ratio (gray matter volume divided by intracranial volume) and age in both genders, and a significant interaction effect of age × gender on the gray matter ratio. In analyzing regional gray matter volume, the g…
17983277	Functional plasticity in cognitive aging: review and hypothesis.	aging	2007-11-??	Cognitive aging reflects not only loss but also adaptation to loss. The adult brain is capable of plastic change, including change in cortical representation. This has been seen in association not only with frank lesions but also in healthy individuals as a function of experience and training. This review considers the potential for adult plasticity together with evidence of a relation in old age between regional cortical atrophy/shrinkage and increased activation in neuroimaging. Those cortical regions shown most consistently to shrink in adulthood--prefrontal and parietal cortices--are the same regions showing increased regional activation in aging. Combining several strands of behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, the author argues that functional plasticity alters the course of cognitive aging. The author advances the hypothesis that losses in regional brain integrity drive functional reorganization through changes in processing strategy and makes specific predictions from that hyp…
12199170	Free-radical damage: a possible mechanism of laryngeal aging.	aging	2002-08-??	We conducted a study of lipid peroxidation as a marker of age-related free-radical damage in the human larynx--the first study of its kind. A colorimetric assay for malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) was performed on extracts taken from thyroarytenoid muscle harvested from fresh cadaveric laryngeal specimens. Levels of MDA and 4-HNE were measured by spectrophotometry. Correlation studies were performed by linear regression analysis. We found that MDA levels in human thyroarytenoid muscle appeared to increase with age while 4-HNE levels showed a slight decrease with age. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies of other organ systems and indicate that there is a need for further study of free-radical damage and the effects of aging on the human larynx and on voice production.
23335261	Aging obviates sex-specific physiological responses to exercise.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVES: Both sex and aging have been shown to affect physiological responses to exercise. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether aging impacted the sex-specific nature of physiological responses to exercise commonly noted among young adults.    METHODS: Ten aged men (69.0 ± 1.7 years; mean ± SE) and 10 aged women (71.6 ± 1.3 years) reporting similar levels of habitual physical activity performed a 30-min exercise session at 60-65% of their predetermined peak oxygen uptake. Cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and metabolic variables were assessed before exercise, at the 15th and 30th min of exercise, and at 5 and 15 min into a passive postexercise recovery period. Variables of interest were statistically analyzed via two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures; significance was set at P < 0.05.    RESULTS: Significant effects of time (i.e., exercise) for each physiological variable of interest were identified, but not once was a significant effect of gro…
16192659	Anabolic responses to resistance training in older men and women: a brief review.	aging	2005-07-??	Resistance training has been shown to be the most effective exercise mode to induce anabolic adaptations in older men and women. Advances in imaging techniques and histochemistry have increased the ability to detect such changes, confirming the high level of adaptability that remains in aging skeletal muscle. This brief review presents a summary of the resistance-training studies that directly compare chronic anabolic responses to training in older (>60 years) men and women. Sixteen studies are summarized, most of which indicate similar relative anabolic responses between older men and women after resistance training. Relatively small sample sizes in most of the interventions limited their ability to detect significant sex differences and should be considered when interpreting these studies. Future research should incorporate larger sample sizes with multiple measurement time points for anabolic responses.
10430642	Age changes of calcaneal ultrasonometry in healthy German women.	aging	1999-08-??	This study assessed age changes in quantitative ultrasound sonometry (QUS) in a large sample of healthy German women. Speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and stiffness index (SI) of the calcaneus were measured in 1333 women (mean age 50.5 +/- 11.5 years) using the Achilles ultrasonometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The short-term precision in 31 adults was 0.2% for SOS, 1. 2% for BUA, and 1.3% for SI. There was an overall decline of 15% for BUA, 4% for SOS, and 31% for SI between late adolescence and old age. In premenopausal women, BUA decreased only slightly (-3%), whereas postmenopausal women showed a significantly increased decline (-12%). In contrast, SOS continuously decreased from the age of 15; there was a decline of 2% from adolescence to the menopause; postmenopausal women showed a slightly larger decline (-2.5%). The SI of premenopausal women decreased by 10%, but the postmenopausal decline of almost 22% was significantly greater. SI values for…
25106097	Protein molecular forms of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 change with aging.	aging	2014-10-??	Aging is considered to be an adaptive mechanism to altered needs of an organism and/or to altered stimuli. Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) increase with age and it is generally assumed that IGFBP-2 is a negative predictor of healthy aging. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of IGFBP-2 molecular forms in different age groups and, specifically, the relationship between IGFBP-2 and alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M). The relative amount of monomer IGFBP-2 was the highest in young persons, making up approximately 2/3 of the total circulating IGFBP-2. This gradually decreased with age down to 1/3 of total IGFBP-2 in elderly individuals. Fragmented IGFBP-2 increased with age and contributed almost 60% to the total immunoreactive IGFBP-2 in the age group 61-80 years. IGFBP-2/α2M complexes represented 10-12% of the total IGFBP-2 in the two younger groups but half this level in the oldest group. The significance of these changes and wh…
18992949	The effects of periodic interruptions of physical activities on the physical capacities of adult active women.	aging	????-??-??	Physical activity programs adapted to the elderly have been proposed with the purpose of minimizing the alterations provoked by aging. These programs usually present break periods of more than 30 days, at least once a year. The aim of this study was to verify if 30-day interruptions cause alterations in the acquisition of physical capacities for senescent women. The study was longitudinal in design, 125 senescent women completed a physical activity program consisting of stretching, aerobic resistance, strength, power and resistance exercises; coordination, agility and flexibility activities; respiratory and relaxation exercises during almost 2 years. Two periods were selected, containing four evaluations with two activities' interruption periods in between the measurements. The main outcome measures were manual pressing strength, flexibility, dynamic balance and physical conditioning (VO2max). During the program there was an increasing tendency for the muscular strength and the VO2max.…
24053437	Does co-residence with adult children associate with better psychological well-being among the oldest old in China?	longevity	2014-03-??	OBJECTIVES: Embedded in a traditional culture where filial piety was honored, living with adult children once had been the most prevalent living arrangement and the best option for Chinese elderly people. This study examined whether co-residence with adult children would be still beneficial to the psychological well-being (PWB) among the oldest old (aged 80 and above) in China today.    METHOD: Using data from the fifth wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey conducted in 2008, the authors examined the living arrangements among the total sample (n = 12,213) and the association between living arrangement and PWB among a subsample (n = 7037) of respondents with normal cognition.    RESULTS: (1) More than half (67.1%) of the unmarried oldest old reported being co-resided with their children; while for the married oldest old, the majority of the respondents (62.4%) lived with a spouse only. (2) For the widowed, co-residence with adult children was associated with better P…
23631441	The αA66-80 peptide interacts with soluble α-crystallin and induces its aggregation and precipitation: a contribution to age-related cataract formation.	aging	2013-05-28	Formation of protein aggregates in the aging eye lens has been shown to correlate with progressive accumulation of specific low-molecular weight (LMW) peptides derived from crystallins. Prominent among the LMW fragments is αA66-80, a peptide derived from αA-crystallin and present at higher concentrations in the water-insoluble nuclear fractions of the aging lens. The αA66-80 peptide has amyloid-like properties and preferentially insolubilizes α-crystallin from soluble lens fractions. However, the specific interactions and mechanisms by which the peptide induces α-crystallin aggregation have not been delineated. To gain insight into the mechanisms of peptide-induced aggregation, we investigated the interactions of the peptide with α-crystallin by various biochemical approaches. The peptide weakens α-crystallin chaperone ability and drastically promotes α-crystallin aggregation via the formation of insoluble peptide-protein complexes through transient intermediates. 4,4'-Dianilino-1,1'-b…
25805435	Development of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations from childhood to elderly age.	lifespan, aging	2016-03-??	Spatial reference frames are fundamental to represent the position of objects or places. Although research has reported changes in spatial memory abilities during childhood and elderly age, no study has assessed reference frames processing during the entire lifespan using the same task. Here, we aimed at providing some preliminary data on the capacity to process reference frames in 283 healthy participants from 6 to 89 years of age. A spatial memory task requiring egocentric/allocentric verbal judgments about objects in peri-/extrapersonal space was used. The main goals were: (1) tracing a baseline of the normal process of development of these spatial components; (2) clarifying if reference frames are differently vulnerable to age-related effects. Results showed a symmetry between children of 6-7 years and older people of 80-89 years who were slower and less accurate than all other age groups. As regards processing time, age had a strong effect on the allocentric component, especially …
15703252	Regional brain changes in aging healthy adults: general trends, individual differences and modifiers.	aging	2005-11-??	Brain aging research relies mostly on cross-sectional studies, which infer true changes from age differences. We present longitudinal measures of five-year change in the regional brain volumes in healthy adults. Average and individual differences in volume changes and the effects of age, sex and hypertension were assessed with latent difference score modeling. The caudate, the cerebellum, the hippocampus and the association cortices shrunk substantially. There was minimal change in the entorhinal and none in the primary visual cortex. Longitudinal measures of shrinkage exceeded cross-sectional estimates. All regions except the inferior parietal lobule showed individual differences in change. Shrinkage of the cerebellum decreased from young to middle adulthood, and increased from middle adulthood to old age. Shrinkage of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortices, the inferior temporal cortex and the prefrontal white matter increased with age. Moreover, shrinkage in the hippocampus and th…
12485366	Alterations in the circadian rhythm of salivary melatonin begin during middle-age.	aging	2003-01-??	To investigate whether free melatonin may be better suited to reveal age-related changes, we studied the circadian rhythm alterations in saliva melatonin levels during aging. Special attention was paid to the question as to how the free melatonin rhythms change in aging and when such changes take place. A total of 52 healthy volunteers participated in the study consisting of young, middle-aged, old and the oldest groups. In each subject, a total of 12 time-point salivary melatonin samples was taken over 24 hr. Of the 52 data sets, 51 exhibited significant circadian rhythm over 24 hr by using the base cosine function analysis to fit the data. A clear circadian rhythm of salivary melatonin was present in all age groups. The decline in nocturnal peak levels (amplitude) in salivary melatonin was found in old and the oldest subjects. Both the old and the oldest subjects showed an increased daytime (baseline) melatonin levels. The off-set melatonin levels were more than two times higher in t…
9282633	Effect of age on P300 wave.	aging	1995-01-??	30 healthy elderly males (mean age 77.4 +/- 4.3 yrs) were subjects in this study. Equal number of young males (mean age 22 +/- 3.5 years) and middle aged subjects (mean age 46 +/- 3.2 years) served as control. P300 wave was estimated using a Neuropack 4 model of Nihon Kohden EMG machine. We observed a significantly increased latency, poorly defined and non reproducible P300 wave in 90% old subjects while in young the latency was in normal limits and the wave was well defined and reproducible. We presume P300 could serve as a future potential marker of the neurophysiological basis of aging.
12661198	Adjustment of muscle mechanics model parameters to simulate dynamic contractions in older adults.	aging	2003-02-??	The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related…
29260191	Effect of Age-Related Human Lens Sutures Growth on Its Fluid Dynamics.	aging	2017-??-01	Purpose: Age-related nuclear cataract is the opacification of the clear ocular lens due to oxidative damage as we age, and is the leading cause of blindness in the world. A lack of antioxidant supply to the core of ever-growing ocular lens could contribute to the cause of this condition. In this project, a computational model was developed to study the sutural fluid inflow of the aging human lens.    Methods: Three different SOLIDWORKS computational fluid dynamics models of the human lens (7 years old; 28 years old; 46 years old) were created, based on available literature data. The fluid dynamics of the lens sutures were modelled using the Stokes flow equations, combined with realistic physiological boundary conditions and embedded in COMSOL Multiphysics.    Results: The flow rate, volume, and flow rate per volume of fluid entering the aging lens were examined, and all increased over the 40 years modelled. However, while the volume of the lens grew by ∼300% and the flow rate increased…
8063668	Total blood volume in healthy young and older men.	aging	1994-05-??	The primary aim of this investigation was to test the general hypothesis that aging does not influence total blood volume in humans. To accomplish this, we measured supine resting plasma volume (modified Evans blue dye technique) and hematocrit in healthy nonobese young (24.7 +/- 1.2 yr, n = 7) and older (66.1 +/- 1.8 yr, n = 7) men carefully matched for body size and daily energy expenditure. Estimated body fat was greater (23 +/- 2 vs. 17 +/- 1%, P < 0.01) and maximal O2 consumption was lower (32.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 48.7 +/- 1.5 ml.kg-1.min-1, P < 0.001) in the older men than in the young controls. Absolute levels of total blood volume were 24% lower (P < 0.01) in the older men than in the young controls (4,749 +/- 333 vs. 6,234 +/- 318 ml). The lower absolute level of total blood volume in the older men was due to a 21% lower (P < 0.01) plasma volume (2,956 +/- 194 vs. 3,745 +/- 176 ml) and a 28% lower (P < 0.01) erythrocyte volume (1,792 +/- 148 vs. 2,488 +/- 158 ml) than in the young co…
26602866	Circadian Characteristics of Older Adults and Aerobic Capacity.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Alteration of circadian rhythmicity with aging might depend on physical aerobic capacity.    METHODS: Three groups of participants were established based on their peak oxygen consumption (Group 1 < 20mL/min/kg; Group 2 > 20mL/min/kg and <30mL/min/kg; Group 3 > 30mL/min/kg). Each participant had an individual evaluation of their circadian rhythmicity characteristics through two well-known circadian rhythms: core temperature and rest/activity cycles. Nocturnal sleep was also recorded using actimetry and diurnal vigilance tested in a car driving simulator.    RESULTS: The amplitude of the oral temperature fluctuations for Group 1 is significantly lower (p < .05) than that of Group 3. Group 2 (p < .01) and Group 3 (p < .05) were significantly more active during the day than Group 1. The index of inactivity during the night for Groups 2 (p < .05) and 3 (p < .01) was higher than Group 1. Results of the car driving simulation showed that for Group 1, the number of lane crossings w…
26728397	Differential changes and interactions of autonomic functioning and sleep architecture before and after 50 years of age.	aging	2016-02-??	We hypothesize that the time when age-related changes in autonomic functioning and in sleep structure occur are different and that autonomic functioning modulates sleep architecture differently before and after 50 years of age. Sixty-eight healthy subjects (aged 20 to 79 years old, 49 of them women) were enrolled. Correlation analysis revealed that wake after sleep onset, the absolute and relative value of stage 1 (S1; S1%), and relative value of stage 2 (S2) were positively correlated with age; however, sleep efficiency, stage 3 (S3), S3%, and rapid-eye-movement latency (REML) were negatively correlated with age. Significant degenerations of sleep during normal aging were occurred after 50 years of age; however, significant declines of autonomic activity were showed before 50 years of age. Before 50 years of age, vagal function during sleep was negatively correlated with arousal index; however, after 50 years of age, it was positively correlated with S1 and S1%. In addition, sympathet…
2504587	Cardiovascular changes associated with decreased aerobic capacity and aging in long-distance runners.	aging	1989-??-??	Fifty-five male runners aged between 30 to 80 years were examined to determine the relative roles of various cardiovascular parameters which may account for the decrease in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) with aging. All subjects had similar body fat composition and trained for a similar mileage each week. The parameters tested were VO2max, maximal heart rate (HRmax), cardiac output (Q), and arteriovenous difference in oxygen concentration (Ca-Cv)O2 during graded, maximal treadmill running. Average body fat and training mileage were roughly 12% and 50 km.week-1, respectively. The average 10-km run-time slowed significantly by 6.0%.decade-1 [( 10-km run-time (min) = 0.323 x age (years) + 24.4] (n = 49, r = 0.692, p less than 0.001]. A strong correlation was found between age and VO2max [( VO2max (ml.kg-1.min-1) = -0.439 x age + 76.5] (n = 55, r = -0.768, p less than 0.001]. Thus, VO2max decreased by 6.9%.decade-1 along with reductions of HRmax (3.2%.decade-1, p less than 0.001) and Q (5.…
25779095	Weakening of Corticomuscular Signal Coupling During Voluntary Motor Action in Aging.	aging	2015-08-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with muscle weakness and impairment in performing skilled motor tasks. Still, little is known about whether the link or functional coupling or connection between the central and peripheral systems during voluntary motor performance is compromised in the elderly subjects. The purposes of this study were to estimate functional corticomuscular connection (CMC) strength in the elderly subjects by calculating EEG-EMG coherence during voluntary motor performance, determine the relationship between the CMC and voluntary muscle force, and compare these between the old and the young subjects.    METHODS: Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of elbow flexion (EF) and EFs at three submaximal (20%, 50%, and 80% MVC) levels were performed in 28 healthy older (74.96±1.32 years) and 20 young (22.60±0.90 years) individuals, while EEG and EMG from biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii muscles were recorded simultaneously.    RESULTS: Compared with the young…
17532162	Effect of PON1 polymorphism on HDL antioxidant potential is blunted with aging.	aging	2007-08-??	Paraoxonase1 is a HDL-associated enzyme, which is responsible for their antioxidant property. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of PON1 [Q192R] and [L55M] genotypes on susceptibility of LDL and HDL to lipid peroxidation and on antioxidant activity of HDL as a function of aging. Seventy-eight healthy subjects distributed in two age groups, young (20-30 years) and elderly (60-89 years) were recruited. PON1 activities and genotype polymorphisms were determined for each subject. LDL and HDL susceptibility to lipid peroxidation was evaluated by the measure of lag-phase (LP) for conjugated diene formation. HDL antioxidant property was evaluated by the measure of their capacity to protect LDL against lipid peroxidation. Our results show that LP for LDL and HDL peroxidation decreased with age of donors. Moreover, PON1 genotypes affect significantly the susceptibility of LDL and HDL to lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, basal- and salt-stimulated paraoxonase as well arylesterase acti…
27267308	American Indian/Alaska Native Elders: A Growing Demographic that Is Changing How We View Aging.	aging	????-??-??	Today, AIAN Elders are more actively engaged in their families and communities, encouraging the development of intergenerational programs, language and cultural revitalization, being stewards in research conducted in their communities, as well passing on their knowledge and experiences on how to live as healthy Native people. Elders have traditionally been quiet and observant of their environment, but the current and future cohorts of Elders are advocates, leaders, and culture bearers for their families and communities and they are now in positions of leadership. Western society acknowledges the value of traditional knowledge and AIAN Elders are viewed as exemplars of healthy aging and their lessons and experiences can be attributed to our own lives. This commentary highlights the paradigm shift in how society views older adults, specifically AIAN Elders and their role in health and wellbeing.
12703521	Effects of aging on the arterial baroreflex control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in healthy subjects.	aging	1994-??-??	To determine how arterial baroreflex gains for sympathetic nerve activity are affected by aging, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the tibial nerve was monitored by microneurography, and heart rate and blood pressure were recorded for the pressor or depressor responses to intravenous injections of phenylephrine or nitroglycerin in 22 healthy humans, aged 16 to 57 years old. Although the arterial baroreflex gain for the heart rate showed attenuation by aging, the gain for MSNA was not affected by aging. These data suggest a preservation of the arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity despite attenuation of the arterial baroreflex control of the heart rate with aging in humans.
21995976	Systemic remodeling of the redox regulatory network due to RNAi perturbations of glutaredoxin 1, thioredoxin 1, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.	aging	2011-10-13	BACKGROUND: Cellular clearance of reactive oxygen species is dependent on a network of tightly coupled redox enzymes; this network rapidly adapts to oxidative conditions such as aging, viral entry, or inflammation. Current widespread use of shRNA as a means to perturb specific redox couples may be misinterpreted if the targeted effects are not monitored in the context of potential global remodeling of the redox enzyme network.    RESULTS: Stable cell lines containing shRNA targets for glutaredoxin 1, thioredoxin 1, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were generated in order to examine the changes in expression associated with altering cytosolic redox couples. A qRT PCR array revealed systemic off-target effects of altered antioxidant capacity and reactive oxygen species formation. Empty lentiviral particles generated numerous enzyme expression changes in comparison to uninfected cells, indicating an alteration in antioxidant capacity irrespective of a shRNA target. Of the three redox …
10372690	Disruption of the pulsatile and entropic modes of insulin release during an unvarying glucose stimulus in elderly individuals.	aging	1999-06-??	Insulin is secreted in a pulsatile fashion with measurable orderliness (low entropy). Aging is characterized by alterations in pulsatile insulin release in the fasting state. We undertook the current studies to determine whether disruptions in pulsatile insulin release in response to sustained glucose infusion also accompany the age-related changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Healthy young (n = 10; body mass index, 23 +/- 1 kg/m2; age, 23 +/- 1 yr) and old (n = 10; body mass index, 24 +/- 1 kg/m2; age, 80 +/- 2 yr) volunteers underwent a 600-min hyperglycemic glucose clamp. During the entire 600 min, insulin was sampled every 10 min, and insulin release was evaluated by Cluster analysis. From 240-360 min, insulin was sampled every 1 min, and secretory pulse analysis was conducted using a multiparameter deconvolution technique. During the 1-min sampling interval, basal insulin secretion (P < 0.01), insulin production rate (P < 0.01), pulsatile mean and integrated insulin concentration (…
8806893	Arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in 60- to 69- vs. 18- to 36-yr-old humans.	aging	1996-06-??	This study was designed to test the hypothesis that aging diminished baroreflex function during central hypovolemia. Eleven healthy young and eleven older (age 60-69 yr) individuals were assessed by using heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to neck pressure and suction during rest and lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of -15 Torr. The slope of forearm vascular resistance to central venous pressure during low-level LBNP was assessed as the index of cardiopulmonary baroreflex sensitivity. Baseline cardiovascular variables were not significantly different between the groups. In addition, there was no group difference in cardiopulmonary baroreflex (-3.6 vs. -3.7 units/mmHg for young vs. older, respectively) or carotid baroreflex (-0.39 vs. -0.35 beats.min-1.mmHg-1 and -0.26 vs. -0.35 mmHg/mmHg, for young vs. older, respectively) sensitivity. LBNP did not affect either HR or MAP, whereas it decreased CVP and increased FVR in both groups. LBNP significantly augmented…
26589359	Information processing becomes slower and predominantly serial in aging: Characterization of response-related brain potentials in an auditory-visual distraction-attention task.	aging	2016-01-??	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aging and attentional capture provoked by novel auditory stimuli on behavior (reaction time [RT], hits) and on response-related brain potentials (preRFP, CRN, postRFP, parietalRP) to target visual stimuli. Twenty-two young, 27 middle-aged, and 24 old adults performed an auditory-visual distraction-attention task. The RTs and latencies of preRFP, postRFP and parietalRT were longer in old and middle-aged than in young participants, reflecting the well-established age-related slowing of processing and performance. The inter-peak latencies (P3b-preRFP, preRFP-parietalRP, parietalRP-postRFP) were also longer in old and middle-aged than in young participants, further indicating an age-related tendency to increased predominance of serial (rather than parallel) processing of information, and that preRFP, CRN, postRFP, and parietalRP represent different cognitive processes from those indexed by the stimulus-related P3b. Finally, a distraction…
3819346	Aging effects on the interaction of hypercapnia and hypoxia as ventilatory stimuli.	aging	1987-03-??	We measured ventilatory responses to progressive hypercapnia at two steady-state levels of oxygenation and to progressive hypoxia at two steady-state levels of CO2 in 10 elderly and 10 young individuals. Under hyperoxic conditions, the ventilatory response to progressive hypercapnia was not significantly different between age groups but, under hypoxic conditions, the response to hypercapnia was lower in the elderly group. The interaction of hypercapnic and hypoxic stimuli was greater among young persons as indicated by a higher ratio of the hypercapnic response slopes (hypoxic/hyperoxic); 1.48 +/- 0.19 versus 0.98 +/- 0.11, p less than .05. The ventilatory response to hypoxia at the lower CO2 level was significantly greater among elderly than among young adults but not significantly different between age groups at the higher CO2 level. The ratio of hypoxic response slopes (high PCO2/lower PCO2) was 1.56 +/- 0.17 among elderly participants and 3.14 +/- 0.63 among young participants (p l…
8149532	Cardiovascular responses to exercise. Effects of aging and exercise training in healthy men.	aging	1994-04-??	BACKGROUND: Cardiac aging alters many of the acute responses to exercise stress, but the extent to which chronic exercise (ie, training) can alter or improve the effects of aging in humans is largely unknown.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular responses to graded supine exercise stress (beginning at 200 kpm and increasing by 200 kpm every 3 minutes till exhaustion) were assessed using radionuclide ventriculography in 13 older (age, 60 to 82 years) and 11 young (age, 24 to 32 years) rigorously screened healthy men before and after 6 months of endurance training. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test significance. During exercise, the old group had a lesser increase in heart rate (+105% old versus +166% young), a greater increase in mean blood pressure (+35% old versus +22% young), lesser increases in ejection fraction (+3 ejection fraction units old versus +11 units young) and peak ejection rate (+62% old versus +119% young), a greater increase in end-diastolic volume index (+8% …
16216462	An investigation of DNA mismatch repair capacity under normal culture conditions and under conditions of supra-physiological challenge in human CD4+T cell clones from donors of different ages.	lifespan	2005-12-??	T cells undergo rapid clonal expansion upon antigenic stimulation to produce an effective immune response. Any defect in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system may have a detrimental effect on T cell proliferation. This study employed an in vitro model of human CD4+T cell ageing to investigate MMR capacity at various stages of T cell lifespan. A novel modification of the alkaline comet assay, which utilised T4 endonuclease VII to detect single base DNA mismatches, was used to assess DNA mismatch frequency. No clear pattern in DNA mismatch frequency with increasing culture age was observed. However, the ability to repair induced DNA mismatches (following treatment with acridine mutagen ICR-191) revealed an age-related decline in the efficiency of the MMR system in clones derived from a 26 and a 45-year-old donor, but not from an 80-year-old very healthy SENIEUR donor. This study suggests that unchallenged, dividing human T cell clones have variable levels of DNA mismatches throughout thei…
19460089	Healthy older adults better tolerate sleep deprivation than young adults.	aging	2009-07-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether healthy aging is associated with increased sleepiness and whether healthy older adults experience more sleepiness when acutely sleep deprived.    DESIGN: A 5-day inpatient circadian rhythm-sleep study consisting of 3 baseline nights followed by an extended 26-hour wake episode under constant conditions.    SETTING: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit, General Clinical Research Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital.    PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven healthy participants without medical, psychological, or sleep disorders: 26 young (7 women, 19 men; mean age 21.9 +/- 3.3, range 18-29) and 11 "young-old" adults (3 women, 8 men; mean age 68.1 +/- 3.6, range 65-76).    INTERVENTION: An extended 26-hour wake episode under constant conditions.    MEASUREMENTS: Electroencephalographic-verified wakefulness, slow eye movements, sustained attention, subjective sleepiness.    RESULTS: During the first 16 hours corresponding to the usual waking day, both groups rated …
27082043	The Associative Memory Deficit in Aging Is Related to Reduced Selectivity of Brain Activity during Encoding.	aging	2016-09-??	Human aging is characterized by reductions in the ability to remember associations between items, despite intact memory for single items. Older adults also show less selectivity in task-related brain activity, such that patterns of activation become less distinct across multiple experimental tasks. This reduced selectivity or dedifferentiation has been found for episodic memory, which is often reduced in older adults, but not for semantic memory, which is maintained with age. We used fMRI to investigate whether there is a specific reduction in selectivity of brain activity during associative encoding in older adults, but not during item encoding, and whether this reduction predicts associative memory performance. Healthy young and older adults were scanned while performing an incidental encoding task for pictures of objects and houses under item or associative instructions. An old/new recognition test was administered outside the scanner. We used agnostic canonical variates analysis an…
30235862	Activity-Friendly Built Environments in a Super-Aged Society, Japan: Current Challenges and toward a Research Agenda.	aging	2018-??-19	There is a growing recognition of the role of built environment attributes, such as streets, shops, greenways, parks, and public transportation stations, in supporting people's active behaviors. In particular, surrounding built environments may have an important role in supporting healthy active aging. Nevertheless, little is known about how built environments may influence active lifestyles in "super-aged societies". More robust evidence-based research is needed to identify how  people live influences their active behaviors, and how to build beneficial space in the context of super-aged societies. This evidence will also be informative for the broader international context, where having an aging society will be the inevitable future. This commentary sought to move this research agenda forward by identifying key research issues and challenges in examining the role of built environment attributes on active behaviors in Japan, which is experiencing the longest healthy life expectancy, bu…
550163	Increased sensitivity to prostaglandin E2 in old people.	aging	1979-12-??	Prostaglandin E2 acts as a feedback inhibitor on the actions of many hormones and other stimuli. For example, mitogens will cause leukocytes to produce prostaglandin E2, and the prostaglandin E2 inhibits the proliferative response of the leukocytes to the mitogen. We have shown that lymphocytes from healthy subjects over age 70 are much more sensitive to inhibition by prostaglandin E2 than are lymphocytes from younger individuals. In this paper, I hypothesize that there is a generalized increase in sensitivity in all tissues in aging humans, and that this increased sensitivity accounts for many of the physiologic changes of aging.
26973112	Interactive effects of age and gender on EEG power and coherence during a short-term memory task in middle-aged adults.	aging	2016-04-??	The effects of age and gender on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during a short-term memory task were assessed in a group of 40 healthy participants aged 22-63 years. Multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 younger (mean = 24.65-year-old, 10 male) and 20 middle-aged participants (mean = 46.40-year-old, 10 male) during performance of a Sternberg task. EEG power and coherence measures were analyzed in different frequency bands. Significant interactions emerged between age and gender in memory performance and concomitant EEG parameters, suggesting that the aging process differentially influences men and women. Middle-aged women showed a lower short-term memory performance compared to young women, which was accompanied by decreasing delta and theta power and increasing brain connectivity with age in women. In contrast, men showed no age-related decline in short-term memory performance and no changes in EEG parameters. These results provide first evidence of age-related alterations in E…
445957	Effect of aging and cigarette smoking on antipyrine and indocyanine green elimination.	aging	1979-07-??	The plasma clearances of antipyrine (AP) and indocyanine green (ICG) have been measured after intravenous administration in each of 20 normal male subjects aged 22 to 72 yr. An additional 4 subjects aged 65 to 73 yr received only ICG. AP clearance fell with age in the group as a whole (r = 0.56; p less than 0.01), but when cigarette smoking habits were considered the relationship was apparent only in smokers (r = 0.68; p less than 0.02). In the under 40 yr group. AP clearance was higher in smokers than nonsmokers (p less than 0.02). There was no such difference in men over 40 yr of age. These observations suggest that the enzyme-inducing effect of smoking diminishes with advancing years. In contrast, and consistent with a reduction in liver blood flow, the clearance of the highly extracted ICG fell with age, irrespective of smoking habits (r = 0.57; p less than 0.004). These findings suggest that while hepatic drug clearance may be impaired in elderly people, the outcome depends not on…
30786280	Age-Related Alterations in Retinal Tissue Perfusion and Volumetric Vessel Density.	aging	2019-??-01	Purpose: To determine age-related alterations in the retinal tissue perfusion (RTP) and volumetric vessel density (VVD) in healthy subjects.    Methods: Total 148 healthy subjects (age 18 to 83 years) were enrolled and divided into four groups (G1, <35 years; G2, 35 ∼ 49 years; G3, 50 ∼ 64 years; and G4, ≥65 years). The RTP and VVD were measured at the macula. The RTP was calculated as the blood flow supplying the macular area (ϕ 2.5 mm) divided by the perfused tissue volume of the inner retina from the inner limiting membrane to the outer plexiform layer. The VVD of the macula (ϕ 2.5 mm) was calculated as the vessel density divided by the corresponding tissue volume.    Results: The RTP and VVD of the retinal vascular network and deep vascular plexus (DVP) reached a peak in G2. Compared to G2, G4 had significantly lower RTP and VVD of DVP (P < 0.05). After 35 years old, age was negatively related to the RTP (r = -0.26, P = 0.02) and VVD of the DVP (r = -0.47, P < 0.001). However, age …
15980651	Age-dependent change of uric acid level in the dermis using cutaneous microdialysis.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: We had proposed the usefulness of cutaneous microdialysis for the study of antioxidants in the skin.    OBJECTIVE: We designed a study analyzing the level of uric acid in the skin, one of the major antioxidants, for an age-dependent change.    METHODS: 16 healthy male volunteers were divided into two groups according to age. Eleven subjects were in their 3rd decade, under 30 years of age (young group) and the others were their 8th decade (old group), over 70 years of age. Dialysate samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis.    RESULTS: In the young group the mean level of uric acid was 31.9+/-16.1 microg/ml, while in old group it was 13.4+/-5.2 microg/ml.    CONCLUSION: This result demonstrated an in vivo state of antioxidant level in the human skin and the age-dependent difference was concordant with other in vitro or ex vivo studies; therefore, cutaneous microdialysis could be used in analysis and monitoring studies including human antiox…
9432159	Differential effects of age and sex on the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis: a prospective MR study.	aging	1998-01-??	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of age and sex on the size of the cerebellar hemispheres, the cerebellar vermis, and the pons in healthy adults.    METHODS: We estimated the volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres (excluding the vermis and the peduncles), the cross-sectional area of the vermis, and the cross-sectional area of the ventral pons from MR images obtained in 146 healthy volunteers, 18 to 77 years old.    RESULTS: We found a mild but significant age-related reduction in the volume of the cerebellar hemispheres and in the total area of the cerebellar vermis; however, the analysis of age trends in the vermian lobules revealed differential age-related declines. The areas of lobules VI and VII and of the posterior vermian lobules (VIII-X) declined significantly with age, whereas the anterior vermis (I-V) showed no significant age-related shrinkage. The volume of the cerebellar hemispheres (especially the right) and the area of the anterior vermis wer…
12357067	Age-associated changes in bone ultrasonometry of the os calcis.	aging	2002-??-??	This cross-sectional study updated age changes for ultrasonometry (QUS) of the os calcis in a large sample of healthy German women. The speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and stiffness index (SI) of the os calcaneus were measured in 5148 women (mean age 55.2 +/- 10.6 yr) using the Achilles ultrasonometer (GE/Lunar). There was an overall decline of 16% for BUA, 4% for SOS, and 32% for SI between late adolescence and old age. In premenopausal women, BUA decreased only slightly (-2%), whereas postmenopausal women showed a significantly increased decline (-12%). In contrast, SOS continuously decreased from the age of 15; there was a decline of 2% from adolescence to menopause. The SI of premenopausal women decreased only by 9%, but the postmenopausal decline of almost 21% was significantly greater. In accordance to our previous report, the age regression for SI in the larger sample differed from the earlier sample, indicating an increased bone loss with aging aft…
24898031	Psychological Resilience and the Onset of Activity of Daily Living Disability Among Older Adults in China: A Nationwide Longitudinal Analysis.	longevity	2015-05-??	OBJECTIVES: This study explores the influence of psychological resilience on the onset of activities of daily living (ADL) disability among Chinese older adults and examines whether this association varies by age.    METHOD: Using a sample of 11,112 older adults from 2 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, collected in 2002 and 2005, this study examines whether higher levels of psychological resilience (measured by a 5-item scale) predict lower risk of ADL incidence during a 3-year follow-up and whether this effect varies by age.    RESULTS: Higher levels of resilience at the baseline are significantly associated with reduced risk of becoming ADL disabled during the 3-year follow-up period, independent of baseline sociodemographic characteristics, family support, and health. Moreover, resilience by age interaction is detected. Higher levels of resilience are more protective against the onset of disability for the younger old (aged 65-84) than the oldest old (aged …
7960462	Quantitative EEG evaluation in normal elderly subjects during mental processes: age-related changes.	aging	1994-05-??	Computerized EEG study was performed on 39 healthy elderly subjects (50-90 years), divided into two cohorts of increasing age (old, older) and on a group of 21 young controls. The EEG was recorded at rest, with eyes closed (EC) and during blocking reaction (BR), fixation (FIX) and mental arithmetic (MA) tasks. At rest with EC, the only significant variation was an increase of beta 1 relative power in old subjects which was positively correlated with age. During the performance of the mental tasks, in the elderly population when compared to young controls, the slow activity decreased slightly or was not significantly modified, while the alpha reactivity progressively decreased, showing a negative correlation with age in the older group. Beta 2 increased significantly in elderly subjects during BR and FIX but such change was less consistent with increasing age. Data show that at rest, the EEG in the elderly population differs only from that of young controls by showing a more pronounced …
7521342	Benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal prostate aging: differences in types I and II 5 alpha-reductase and steroid hormone receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels, but not in insulin-like growth factor mRNA levels.	aging	1993-11-??	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is so common in elderly men that the development of adenomatous nodules in this organ can be seen as a normal age-dependent process. In this work, we used Northern blotting to compare the levels of androgen, estrogen, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in young (age range, 23-33; n = 3), old normal (age range, 52-80; n = 3), and BPH-affected subjects (age range, 66-87; n = 15). We have also investigated in these groups the expression of genes coding for the two 5 alpha-reductases (types I and II), aromatase, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Our results show significantly increased levels of IGF mRNA in old healthy and BPH-affected subjects; the respective rises for IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-I receptor mRNAs were 3.0-, 2.9-, and 1.5-fold (BPH) and 2.7-, 2.4-, and 1.8-fold (old normal controls). For estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and type I and II 5 alpha-reductase mRNAs, a marked but opposite effect was observed in adenomatous tissues only; the re…
17452742	Age-related changes in skeletal muscle as detected by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.	aging	2007-04-??	BACKGROUND: Loss of muscle mass and strength is a common symptom in the elderly population. This is partly a result of the structural changes that occur during the aging process. We applied diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) to determine if water diffusivity in skeletal muscle changes with age.    METHODS: Thirty-eight healthy men, ranging from 27 to 67 years of age, were recruited for this study. The total population was grouped by age (Young < mean age 46.4: n = 20; Old > or = mean age 46.4: n = 18) and body mass index (BMI; Normal < 25: n = 20; Over > or =25: n = 18). The principal, second, and third eigenvalues (lambda(1) > or = lambda(2) > or = lambda(3)), and fractional anisotropy (FA), were calculated from the diffusion tensor of the soleus, lateral and medial gastrocnemius, and anterior tibialis (AT). Analyses included comparison of groups and linear regressions.    RESULTS: The older adults showed a significant reduction in the eigenvalues of the plantar flexo…
25043924	Dietary patterns and cognitive decline in Taiwanese aged 65 years and older.	aging	2015-05-??	OBJECTIVE: This study examines the association between dietary patterns and cognitive decline in Taiwanese aged 65 years and older.    METHODS: Data were from a population-based longitudinal study, the Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging, with a nationally representative sample.    RESULTS: Nearly 2%, 8%, and 3% of participants had a western, traditional, and healthy dietary pattern, respectively. Western and traditional dietary patterns were negatively associated with subsequent short portable mental state questionnaire score over 4 and/or 8 years (all p < 0.05), whereas a healthy dietary pattern was not. Western dietary patterns significantly increased, by nearly threefold, the risk of subsequent cognitive decline over 8 years (adjusted odds ratio = 4.35, 95% confidence interval = 1.52-12.50, p < 0.05). For elders aged 65-74 years, a western dietary pattern was positively associated with increased, by eightfold, risk of cognitive decline over 8 years (adjusted odds ratio = 9.35, 95% c…
22724909	Factors influencing the successful aging of older Korean adults.	aging	2012-04-??	BACKGROUND: The study trend has been undergoing a change, increasingly focusing on successful aging factors for obtaining a healthy and happy life in old age and in an aging society. This study examined and identified the factors influencing the degree of successful aging among older Korean adults. This study was a cross-sectional design. The participants comprised of 305 Korean older people aged 60 years or over, who met eligibility criteria.    MEASURES: Measures were a general characteristics form, the self-liking/self-competence scale-revised version (SLCS-R) form, the self-efficacy scale, the interpersonal relationship scale, the self-achievement instrument, and the successful aging scale.    RESULTS: The analyses showed that the prediction model for successful aging among older Korean adults was significant (F = 159.09, p < 0.001). The value of the adjusted R(2) was 0.692, which corresponds to the explanatory power of 69.2%. The factor that was found to have the most influence on…
24082105	Like cognitive function, decision making across the life span shows profound age-related changes.	aging	2013-10-15	It has long been known that human cognitive function improves through young adulthood and then declines across the later life span. Here we examined how decision-making function changes across the life span by measuring risk and ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains, as well as choice consistency, in an urban cohort ranging in age from 12 to 90 y. We identified several important age-related patterns in decision making under uncertainty: First, we found that healthy elders between the ages of 65 and 90 were strikingly inconsistent in their choices compared with younger subjects. Just as elders show profound declines in cognitive function, they also show profound declines in choice rationality compared with their younger peers. Second, we found that the widely documented phenomenon of ambiguity aversion is specific to the gain domain and does not occur in the loss domain, except for a slight effect in older adults. Finally, extending an earlier report by our group, we found th…
20478901	Human neuroscience and the aging mind: a new look at old problems.	aging	2010-07-??	In this article, marking the 65th anniversary of the Journal of Gerontology, we offer a broad-brush overview of the new synthesis between neuroscientific and psychological approaches to cognitive aging. We provide a selective review of brain imaging studies and their relevance to mechanisms of cognitive aging first identified primarily from behavioral measurements. We also examine some new key discoveries, including evidence favoring plasticity and compensation that have emerged specifically from using cognitive neuroscience methods to study healthy aging. We then summarize several recent neurocognitive theories of aging, including our own model-the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition. We close by discussing some newly emerging trends and future research trajectories for investigating the aging mind and brain.
24283536	The relationship between skin aging and steady state ultraweak photon emission as an indicator of skin oxidative stress in vivo.	aging	2014-08-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Ultraweak photon emission (UPE) is one potential method to evaluate the oxidative status of the skin in vivo. However, little is known about how the daily oxidative stress of the skin is related to skin aging-related alterations in vivo. We characterized the steady state UPE and performed a skin survey.    METHODS: We evaluated the skin oxidative status by UPE, skin elasticity, epidermal thickness and skin color on the inner upper arm, the outer forearm, and the buttock of 70 Japanese volunteers.    RESULTS: The steady state UPE at the three skin sites increased with age. Correlation analysis revealed that the steady state UPE only from the buttock was related to skin elasticity, which showed age-dependent changes. Moreover, analysis by age group indicated that b* values of the inner upper arm of subjects in their 20s were inversely correlated with UPE as occurred in buttock skin. In contrast, photoaged skin did not show a clear relationship with steady state UPE be…
11145321	Prefrontal neuropsychological effects of sleep deprivation in young adults--a model for healthy aging?	aging	2000-12-15	Neuropsychological testing and brain imaging show that healthy aging leads to a preferential impairment of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Interestingly, in young adults sleep deprivation (SD) has similar effects. Psychological tasks not so oriented to the PFC are less sensitive both to SD and aging. The PFC is a cortical region working particularly hard during wakefulness, which may make it more vulnerable to "deterioration," whether this is through aging or SD. In these respects SD in young adults may offer a model for aging. No study has directly compared aging with SD. We compared groups comprising (equal sexes): YOUNG (av. 23y), MIDDLE AGED (av. 60y) and OLD (av. 73y). Young were subdivided into SD and non-sleep deprived groups. All participants were carefully screened, were healthy, good sleepers and with a similar educational background. A battery of PFC-oriented, short and straightforward neuropsychological tests was used to compare the effects of 36h of SD in the young group, wit…
11915910	Muscle protein metabolism and the sarcopenia of aging.	aging	2001-12-??	Loss of muscle mass, strength, and oxidative capacity accompanies normal aging in humans. The mechanisms responsible for these changes remain to be clearly defined. Muscle protein mass and function depend on protein turnover. Synthesis rate of the major muscle contractile protein, myosin heavy chain (MHC), and transcript levels of fast MHC isoforms decrease in association with strength reductions, while mitochondrial protein synthesis rate declines in parallel with activities of mitochondrial enzymes and maximal oxidative capacity (VO2max). Resistance exercise training increases the synthesis rate of MHC and transcript levels of the slow MHC isoform in older humans, along with increasing muscle strength. The relationship between the synthesis of muscle proteins, and muscle size and function, with aging and exercise training are discussed in this review.
7896586	Beta-adrenergic effects on left ventricular filling: influence of aging and exercise training.	aging	1994-12-??	Reduced heart rate and contractile responses to beta-agonist stimulation characterize normal cardiac aging, but whether diastolic responses also decline with aging has not been determined in humans. Diastolic filling responses to isoproterenol were determined in 13 older (60-82 yr) and 11 young (24-32 yr) healthy men before and after endurance training. Filling rates were expressed in three ways: 1) normalized to end-diastolic volume per second, 2) normalized to stroke volume per second, and 3) as absolute milliliters of blood (ml.s-1.m-2). Peak early filling rates by all methods were reduced at rest and all isoproterenol doses with aging (all P < 0.0001 for old vs. young), whereas peak atrial filling rates were increased with aging. During isoproterenol, both peak early and peak atrial filling rates increased significantly (all P < 0.01); the increase in filling rates with isoproterenol was not different with aging (all NS for old vs. young x dose). Endurance training did not augment …
9195683	Normal aging and human physiology.	aging	1997-05-??	This article discusses the physiological changes that accompany normal aging and current understandings of how environmental factors interact with a person's genetic mechanisms to slow or speed up the aging process. Chronological age is contrasted with biological age to illustrate the different rates and extent of anatomical changes and functional declines observed in older people of the same age, behaviors that appear to delay or reduce the inevitable progression of sensescence, the extraordinary heterogeneity of the aging population, and the complexity of the processes responsible for the consequences of human aging.
17942471	Hormonal regulators of muscle and metabolism in aging (HORMA): design and conduct of a complex, double masked multicenter trial.	aging	2007-??-??	BACKGROUND: Older persons often lose muscle mass, strength, and physical function. This report describes the challenges of conducting a complex clinical investigation assessing the effects of anabolic hormones on body composition, physical function, and metabolism during aging.    METHODS: HORMA is a multicenter, randomized double masked study of 65-90-year-old community dwelling men with testosterone levels of 150-550 ng/dL and IGF-1 < 167 ng/dL. Subjects were randomized to transdermal testosterone (5 or 10 g/day) and rhGH (0, 3, or 5 microg/kg/day) for 16 weeks. Outcome measures included body composition by DEXA, MRI, and (2)H(2)O dilution; muscle performance (strength, power, and fatigability), VO2peak, measures of physical function, synthesis/breakdown of myofibrillar proteins, other measures of metabolism, and quality of life.    RESULTS: Major challenges included delay in startup caused by need for 7 institutional contracts, creating a 142-page manual of operations, orientation a…
18534661	Higher circulating levels of uric acid are prospectively associated with better muscle function in older persons.	aging	2008-09-??	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that oxidative protein damage is independently associated with low grip strength and that dietary intake and circulating levels of antioxidant vitamins are positive predictors of muscle strength among older persons. Since uric acid (UA), has strong antioxidant properties, we tested the hypothesis that UA levels is cross-sectionaly associated with muscle strength and protective against the decline of strength over the aging process.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 789 InCHIANTI Study participants underwent baseline serum UA, handgrip and knee extension torque measurements. Of these, 497 participants (226 men and 271 women, mean age 76.0+/-5.4 years) also had follow-up strength measures. Lifestyle, comorbidities, nutritional profile, inflammatory markers and other laboratory measures were considered as potential confounders.    RESULTS: Follow-up strength measures significantly increased across baseline UA tertiles. After adjusting for potential confounde…
27459861	Impact of Aging on Endurance and Neuromuscular Physical Performance: The Role of Vascular Senescence.	aging	2017-04-??	The portion of society aged ≥60 years is the fastest growing population in the Western hemisphere. Aging is associated with numerous changes to systemic physiology that affect physical function and performance. We present a narrative review of the literature aimed at discussing the age-related changes in various metrics of physical performance (exercise economy, anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake, muscle strength, and power). It also explores aging exercise physiology as it relates to global physical performance. Finally, this review examines the vascular contributions to aging exercise physiology. Numerous studies have shown that older adults exhibit substantial reductions in physical performance. The process of decline in endurance capacity is particularly insidious over the age of 60 years and varies considerably as a function of sex, task specificity, and individual training status. Starting at the age of 50 years, aging also implicates an impressive deterioration of neuromusc…
24828758	Measurement of the time of flight of photons into the skin: influence of site, age and gender, correlation with other skin parameters.	aging	2015-02-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The speed of light (time of flight) into the skin is obviously relied to its structure, and might appear as a tool for non-invasive investigation of skin physico-chemical properties, among them aging is of primary importance. Though already published, such time of flight measurements have never been extensively correlated with other well-documented skin parameters such as localization, the influence of gender and age, the elasticity and roughness, and the water trans-epidermal diffusion (TEWL).    METHODS: A specific practical device was designed to routinely measure the time of flight (TOF) of the light into the human skin 'in vivo', in a totally non-invasive process. This system was tested on volunteers, to relate the TOF parameter to the widely investigated skin properties already mentioned. An Infra-red laser at 1064 nm delivered powerful pulses of less than 1 ns duration, sent to the skin surface through a lossless fibre. The light backscattered at a given dist…
19619389	On the origins of ageism among older and younger adults.	aging	2009-12-??	BACKGROUND: Ageism is apparent in many social structures and contexts and in diverse forms over the life cycle. This review discusses the development and consequences of ageism toward elderly people by others of any age, according to the Terror Management Theory (TMT) and the Social Identity Theory (SIT).    METHOD: A systematic search of the literature was carried out on the social and psychological origins of ageism in younger and older adults.    RESULTS: Studies on the reasons for ageism among older adults point to attitudes that older adults have toward their own age group, while studies on ageism in young adults explain it as an unconscious defensive strategy which younger adults use against death anxiety. In other words, TMT can serve as a suitable framework for ageism in younger adults, and SIT appears to explain ageism in older adults.    CONCLUSIONS: A dissociation of the linkage between death and old age in younger adults can be achieved by changing the concepts of death and…
3189174	Influence of age on left ventricular contractility.	aging	1988-11-15	Controversy exists about whether left ventricular (LV) function is affected by aging. Therefore, peak systolic pressure to end-systolic diameter, peak systolic pressure to end-systolic volume, systolic wall stress to fractional shortening and systolic wall stress to end-systolic diameter relations were calculated in the left ventricle of 10 healthy subjects greater than 65 years old (age 70 +/- 4 years) (group B). They were compared with a control group composed by 10 healthy subjects (group A, age 22 +/- 1 years). LV measurements were obtained with M-mode echocardiography and an automatic cuff was used to determine blood pressure. Changes in the load conditions were obtained by 15 mg sublingual isosorbide dinitrate. There were no differences in resting end-systolic diameter, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic diameter, end-diastolic volume, fractional shortening, ejection fraction or systolic wall stress. Older subjects had higher values of resting peak systolic pressure (p less than …
9375323	Age and gender comparisons of muscle strength in 654 women and men aged 20-93 yr.	aging	1997-11-??	To assess age and gender differences in muscle strength, isometric, concentric (Con), and eccentric (Ecc) peak torque was measured in the knee extensors at a slow (0.52 rad/s) and fast (3.14 rad/s) velocity in 654 subjects (346 men and 308 women, aged 20-93 yr) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Regression analysis revealed significant (P < 0.001) age-related reductions in Con and Ecc peak torque for men and women at both velocities, but no differences were observed between the gender groups or velocities. Age explained losses in Con better than Ecc peak torque, accounting for 30% (Con) vs. 19% (Ecc) of the variance in men and 28% (Con) vs. 11% (Ecc) in women. To assess age and gender differences in the ability to store and utilize elastic energy, the stretch-shortening cycle was determined in a subset of subjects (n = 47). The older women (mean age = 70 yr) showed a significantly greater enhancement in the stretch-shortening cycle, compared with men of similar age (P < 0.…
15952031	Contributions of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and apoptosis to human skeletal muscle wasting with age.	aging	2005-09-??	The primary mechanism that contributes to decreasing skeletal muscle strength and size with healthy aging is not presently known. This study examined the contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and apoptosis to skeletal muscle wasting in older adults (n = 21; mean age = 72.76 +/- 8.31 years) and young controls (n = 21; mean age = 21.48 +/- 2.93 years). Subjects underwent a percutaneous muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis to determine: (1) ubiquitin ligase gene expression (MAFbx and MuRF1); (2) frequency of apoptosis; and (3) individual fiber type and cross-sectional area. In addition, a whole muscle strength test was also performed. A one-way ANOVA revealed significant increases in the number of positive TUNEL cells in older adults (87%; p < 0.05), although no significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity was detected. Additionally, ubiquitin ligase gene expression, individual muscle fiber type and CSA were not different between old and young subjects. Muscle strength was als…
16183948	Triceps surae muscle power, volume, and quality in older versus younger healthy men.	aging	2005-09-??	This study investigated whether loss of power with aging is fully accounted for by a decrease in muscle volume. Triceps surae power and volume (VOL) were measured in 18 older (OM: 69-82 years) and 12 younger men (YM: 19-35 years). Isokinetic peak torque was measured to determine torque-velocity and power-velocity relationships. Both peak power observed (PP(obs)) and peak power estimated from Hill's equation (PP(est)) were markedly reduced in the OM (PP(obs) was 45% and PP(est) was 43% of those of the YM). VOL was 81% of that of the YM (p <.001). Specific power (PP(est)/VOL) of the OM was 55.2% of that of the YM (p <.001). Torque at PP(est) accounted for a greater proportion of the decline in PP(est) in the OM than did optimum velocity (50% vs 13%, respectively). Hence, the present results showed that only approximately half of the loss in triceps surae peak power in old age is due to decreases in muscle VOL.
24700277	Age-Related Deficits in Visuospatial Memory Are due to Changes in Preparatory Set and Eye-Hand Coordination.	aging	2015-09-??	OBJECTIVES: Healthy aging is associated with a decline in visuospatial working memory. The nature of the changes leading to this decline in response of the eye and/or hand is still under debate. This study aims to establish whether impairments observed in performance on cognitive tasks are due to actual cognitive effects or are caused by motor-related eye-hand coordination.    METHODS: We implemented a computerized version of the Corsi span task. The eye and touch responses of healthy young and older adults were recorded to a series of remembered targets on a screen.    RESULTS: Results revealed differences in fixation strategies between the young and the old with increasing cognitive demand, which resulted in higher error rates in the older group. We observed increasing reaction times and durations between fixations and touches to targets, with increasing memory load and delays in both the eye and the hand in the older adults.    DISCUSSION: Our results show that older adults have dif…
19356825	Effects of aging on the cerebrovascular orthostatic response.	aging	2011-02-??	When healthy subjects stand up, it is associated with a reduction in cerebral blood velocity and oxygenation although cerebral autoregulation would be considered to prevent a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Aging is associated with a higher incidence of falls, and in the elderly falls may occur particularly during the adaptation to postural change. This study evaluated the cerebrovascular adaptation to postural change in 15 healthy younger (YNG) vs. 15 older (OLD) subjects by recordings of the near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cerebral oxygenation (cO₂Hb) and the transcranial Doppler-determined mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V(mean)). In OLD (59 (52-65) years) vs. YNG (29 (27-33) years), the initial postural decline in mean arterial pressure (-52 ± 3% vs. -67 ± 3%), cO₂Hb (-3.4 ± 2.5 μmoll(-1) vs. -5.3 ± 1.7 μmoll(-1)) and MCA V(mean) (-16 ± 4% vs. -29 ± 3%) was smaller. The decline in MCA V(mean) was related to the reduction in MAP. During prolonged orthostatic st…
20472072	Aging and decision making under uncertainty: behavioral and neural evidence for the preservation of decision making in the absence of learning in old age.	aging	2010-10-01	Decision making under uncertainty is an essential component of everyday life. Recent psychological studies suggest that older adults, despite age-related neurological decline, can make advantageous decisions when information about the contingencies of the outcomes is available. In this study, a two-choice prediction paradigm has been used, in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to investigate the effects of normal aging on neural substrates underlying uncertain decision making in the absence of learning that have not been addressed in previous neuroimaging studies. Neuroimaging results showed that both the healthy older and young adults recruited a network of brain regions comprising the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, medial frontal cortex, and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex during the prediction task. As was hypothesized, the performance of older adults in the prediction task was not impaired compared to young a…
8071737	Foveal flicker sensitivity in healthy aging eyes. II. Cross-sectional aging trends from 18 through 77 years of age.	aging	1994-07-??	Foveal flicker contrast sensitivity was measured for healthy adults at temporal frequencies from 2.5 to 50 Hz. The first experiment compared two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) and yes-no detection (Y-N) testing procedures for younger (19-33-year-old) and older (67-73-year-old) observers. The 2IFC technique resulted in higher absolute estimates of sensitivity. However, within a method, relative differences were similar. Therefore the two methods gave similar estimates of temporal contrast-sensitivity change with age. Experiment 2 compared 89 observers from 18 through 77 years of age to explore the effect of the time course of aging on flicker sensitivity. The 2IFC procedure was used, and retinal illuminance changes with age were controlled. Significant overall losses in contrast sensitivity were found for the 45-54, 55-64, and 65-77-year-old age groups. Overall sensitivities for the 35-44-year-old group were comparable with or (not significantly) higher than those for the 18-24- and 25-3…
22560874	fMRI study in posterior cingulate and adjacent precuneus cortex in healthy elderly adults using problem solving task.	aging	2012-07-15	PURPOSE: To explore the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the adjacent precuneus regions in healthy elderly adults during problem solving tasks.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen participants (7 women, mean age of 63.6±6.0 years old) were analyzed. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks were simplified 4×4 Sudoku puzzles that were divided into simple tasks (using the row rule or the column rule to solve the puzzle) and complex tasks (using both the row and column rules to solve the puzzle).    RESULTS: The mean accuracy on the simple task was higher than that on the complex task (P=0.04); the reaction time on the simple task was shorter than that on the complex task (P=0.001). On both tasks, the participants showed deactivation in the bilateral PCC/precuneus regions. The extent of deactivation on the complex task was greater than that on the simple task (left: P=0.04; right: P=0.04).    CONCLUSIONS: Healthy elderly…
22932182	Age-associated changes in pulmonary function: a comparison of pulmonary function parameters in healthy young adults and the elderly living in Shanghai.	aging	2012-09-??	BACKGROUND: The respiratory system changes with age and a better understanding of the changes contribute to detect and prevent respiratory dysfunctions in old population. The purpose of this study was to observe age-associated changes of pulmonary function parameters in healthy young adults and the elderly.    METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 600 male and female subjects aged 19 to 92 years. The subjects were divided into three groups by age: young adult (19 - 39 years), middle-aged adult (40 - 59 years), and the elderly (≥ 60 years). The pulmonary function was measured with routine examination methods and 13 parameters including vital capacity (VC), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC), RV/TLC, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow at 25% of FVC exhaled (FEF(25)), forced expiratory flow at 50% of FVC exhaled (FEF(50))…
27320413	Functional limitation and cognitive impairment among 80+ year old Chinese.	longevity	2016-12-??	AIM: This study examined functional limitation in relation to cognitive impairment among 80+ year old Chinese.    METHODS: Cognitively-intact adults ≥80 years old (n = 5161) came from the 1998 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Cognitive impairment was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination. Functional limitation was assessed by Katz activities of daily living (ADLs). Cox regressions were performed to examine the relationship between functional limitation in 1998 and cognitive impairment onset during the follow-up period of 1998-2012.    RESULTS: Compared to those without ADLs limitation at baseline, participants with ADLs limitations were 49% more likely to develop cognitive impairment during follow-up. A dose-response relationship was identified - compared to those without ADLs limitation at baseline, those with one, two to five and all six ADLs limitations were 46, 50 and 180% more likely to develop cognitive impairment during follow-up, respectively.    CONCLUSION: B…
22818903	Lateralized processing of false memories and pseudoneglect in aging.	aging	2013-05-??	Aging is associated with higher propensity to false memories and decreased retrieval of previously studied items. When young adults (YA) perform on a lateralized version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, the right cerebral hemisphere (RH) is more sensitive than the left (LH) to false memories, suggesting hemispheric imbalance in the cerebral mechanisms supporting semantic and episodic memory processes. Since cerebral asymmetries tend to be reduced with age, we surmised that behavioral asymmetries in the generation of false memories would be diminished with aging. To probe this hypothesis, a lateralized version of the DRM paradigm was administered to healthy older adults (OA) and YA. During the encoding phase, lists of semantically associated words were memorized. During the retrieval session, targets (previously seen words), lures (LU) (never seen strongly semantically related words) and distracters (never seen, unrelated words) were briefly displayed either in the left o…
20142771	Motor unit number estimates in masters runners: use it or lose it?	aging	2010-09-??	INTRODUCTION: A contributing factor to the loss of muscle mass and strength during aging is the reduction in the number of functioning motor units (MU). It has been shown that lifelong physically active older rats have greater numbers of MU compared with age-matched sedentary controls, suggesting that chronic exercise may preserve MU function with advancing age. This has not previously been examined in humans.    PURPOSE: Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the number of functioning MU in the tibialis anterior of masters runners (approximately 65 yr) and to compare the values with recreationally active young (approximately 25 yr) and healthy age-matched controls (approximately 65 yr).    METHODS: Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular EMG signals during dorsiflexion at 25% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction.    RESULTS: The estimated number of MU did not differ between masters runners and young, but MU number e…
27327032	Resistance Training Increases Skeletal Muscle Capillarization in Healthy Older Men.	aging	2016-??-??	PURPOSE: Skeletal muscle capillarization plays a key role in oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle. The loss of muscle mass with aging and the concept of anabolic resistance have been, at least partly, attributed to changes in skeletal muscle capillary structure and function. We aimed to compare skeletal muscle capillarization between young and older men and evaluate whether resistance-type exercise training increases muscle capillarization in older men.    METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of healthy young (n = 14, 26 ± 2 yr) and older (n = 16, 72 ± 1 yr) adult men, with biopsies before and after 12 wk of resistance-type exercise training in the older subjects. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess skeletal muscle fiber size, capillary contacts (CC) per muscle fiber, and the capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange (CFPE) index in type I and II muscle fibers.    RESULTS: Type II muscle fibers were smaller in old versus young (4507 ± 268 vs 6084 ± 497 μm,…
23245833	Glutamate changes in healthy young adulthood.	aging	2013-11-??	Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and has been associated with several cognitive functions that are known to change with age. In rodents and humans age-related glutamate changes have been found in several brain areas. In this cross-sectional study the presence and extent of age-associated glutamate changes in the medial frontal cortex of healthy young adults were measured. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and brain imaging were performed at 7 T in a 2 × 2 × 2 cm(3) voxel in 33 participants between 18 and 31 years old. Glutamate concentrations and grey and white matter volume could be successfully determined at an ultra-high magnetic field strength. Glutamate concentrations were lower in older individuals (0.33 mM/year). This decline is in line with grey matter thinning in the medial frontal cortex, but could not be explained by cortical thinning alone. Therefore, the decrease in glutamate in young adulthood may b…
15962810	Assessment of total antioxidant capacity in human plasma.	aging	2004-??-??	INTRODUCTION: Human serum contains many different antioxidants that may be important in the maintenance of antioxidant screen. Aging decreases the level of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant in plasma. In this study we investigated total antioxidant capacity in plasma obtained from healthy young and old volunteers.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: The ferric reducing antioxidant capacity was used to measure the total antioxidant capacity of plasma. In in vitro experiments, the effects of exogenous compounds (ascorbic acid, uric acid, Trolox) on total ferric reducing activity of plasma obtained from young females were tested. Total antioxidant capacity of plasma was expressed as micromol Trolox equivalent/1 (a water-soluble analog of vitamin E).    RESULTS: We demonstrated that total antioxidant capacity of plasma obtained from healthy young females and males did not differ significantly between each other (22.9 +/- 1.1 and 24.4 +/- 1.1 micromol Trolox equivalent/1, respectively) and was s…
12559408	Mitotic brain cells are just as prone to mitochondrial deletions as neurons: a large-scale single-cell PCR study of the human caudate nucleus.	aging	2002-12-??	Mitochondria are considered a key element in the process of organismic aging, because of their fundamental role in cellular energy generation. In the course of oxidative phosphorylation, harmful free radicals are continuously produced damaging the mitochondrial (mt) genome. One of the consequences is the occurrence of large-scale deletions in mtDNA molecules. The 4977 bp common deletion accumulates exponentially with age, in a mosaic pattern, especially in postmitotic tissues. In order to investigate whether certain cell characteristics underlie this pattern of distribution, and to look for possible age-related changes, two cell types in the caudate nucleus of the human brain from five young and five senescent subjects were analysed by single-cell PCR.MAP2-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes were isolated by micromanipulation. For each of the 10 cases, at least 30 cells of each type were collected and subjected to PCR individually. Screening for the presence of the common del…
11389930	Age-related accumulation of oxidative DNA damage and alterations in levels of p16(INK4a/CDKN2a), p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) and p27(KIP1) in human CD4+ T cell clones in vitro.	lifespan	2001-08-??	T cells in vivo have been shown to accumulate DNA damage with age. To investigate the effects of DNA damage on T cell biology we have utilised an in vitro human CD4+ T cell clone model. Levels and types of DNA damage were determined in 11 independent T cell clones as a function of their in vitro lifespan. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced DNA damage with increasing age were found in all clones analysed using a modified alkaline comet assay. T cell clones underwent apoptosis at the end of their lifespans. There were no consistent changes in the mRNA levels for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) p16, p21, and p27 during the clones' lifespans. It appears that the increased levels of ROS induced DNA damage in the T cells is not the major trigger of apoptosis, via the p53/p21 pathway. In addition, at the end of their lifespans, the T cell clones did not display the CKI phenotype reported for senescent cells (an increase in p16 and p21 levels). Thus, while t…
15207411	Cognitive and affective disorders in the elderly: a neuroendocrine study.	aging	2004-??-??	Both in physiological and pathological brain aging, cognitive and affective disorders usually keep up with significant morphological and metabolic changes of brain areas possibly involved in the control of mood, learning and memory, as well as in the modulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of this work was to study the circadian rhythm of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) in 25 old demented patients and 10 old unipolar depressed patients, compared with 21 old and 13 young controls. The circadian profile of serum cortisol was clearly flattened in elderly subjects,both healthy and demented, in comparison to young controls, with significantly higher cortisol levels at nighttime. The occurrence of minor depression was associated with a further increase of the cortisol mean levels in old demented subjects, but not in the healthy ones. The trend towards the increase of the nocturnal cortisol levels was also evident in old subjects with major depres…
26522424	The Reference Ability Neural Network Study: Life-time stability of reference-ability neural networks derived from task maps of young adults.	aging	2016-01-15	Analyses of large test batteries administered to individuals ranging from young to old have consistently yielded a set of latent variables representing reference abilities (RAs) that capture the majority of the variance in age-related cognitive change: Episodic Memory, Fluid Reasoning, Perceptual Processing Speed, and Vocabulary. In a previous paper (Stern et al., 2014), we introduced the Reference Ability Neural Network Study, which administers 12 cognitive neuroimaging tasks (3 for each RA) to healthy adults age 20-80 in order to derive unique neural networks underlying these 4 RAs and investigate how these networks may be affected by aging. We used a multivariate approach, linear indicator regression, to derive a unique covariance pattern or Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN) for each of the 4 RAs. The RANNs were derived from the neural task data of 64 younger adults of age 30 and below. We then prospectively applied the RANNs to fMRI data from the remaining sample of 227 adult…
15110004	The topography of white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI in healthy 60- to 64-year-old individuals.	aging	2004-05-??	We report the topography of brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging in 477 healthy subjects aged 60-64 years selected randomly from the community. WMHs were delineated by using a computer algorithm. We found that all subjects had periventricular WMHs and 96.6% subjects also had deep WMHs. The mean volume of WMHs was 4.9 ml, comprising 0.83% of the white matter, of which 1.2 ml was severe in intensity. The deep WMHs were distributed throughout the cerebral hemispheres, with the occipital and frontal white matter bearing the greatest burden. The territory of the lenticulostriate arteries had the greatest WMHs. A white matter region of 4 mm adjacent to the cortex was not affected by hyperintensities. The mean (SD) number of discrete WMHs was 19.6 (7.1) per subject, of which 6.1 (4.4) were severe in intensity. Nearly half (48.6%) of the subjects had at least one large WMH (>12 mm diameter) and one eigh…
28323091	Age related differences in functional synchronization of EEG activity as evaluated by means of TMS-EEG coregistrations.	aging	2017-??-24	It was recently demonstrated that the characteristics of EEG rhythms preceding a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex (M1) influence the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude with a peculiar pattern, thus reflecting the M1 functional state. As physiological aging is related to a decrease in motor performance and changes in excitability and connectivity strength within cerebral sensorimotor circuits, we aimed to explore whether aging affects EEG-MEP interactions. Using MRI-navigated TMS and multichannel EEG, we compared the EEG-MEP interactions observed in healthy aged subjects with those observed in young volunteers. We divided the MEPs amplitude into two different subgroups consisting of "high" and "low" MEPs, based on the 50th percentile of their amplitude distribution. Then we analysed the characteristics of the pre-stimulus EEG from M1 and correlated areas separately for the "high" and "low" MEPs, comparing the two conditions. In both young and old subjects,…
3622655	Altered sensitivity of protein synthesis to paromomycin in extracts from aging human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1987-??-??	Age-related differences in the effects of paromomycin (Pm) on protein synthesis have been investigated in translation reactions with extracts derived from young and old human diploid fibroblasts. Translation products from reactions directed by endogenous or exogenous mRNA were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The exogenous mRNA lacked codons for cysteine, and therefore cysteine incorporation into translation products represented translational error. This laboratory has previously used this assay to show that the basal translational error level in the absence of Pm increases in extracts from old fibroblasts. In this report, Pm stimulated the misincorporation of cysteine by 6-7 fold over cysteine misincorporation levels in the absence of Pm. This degree of Pm stimulation was similar in extracts from young and old fibroblasts. However, other results showed quantitative differences in the responses to Pm between young and old cell extracts. Old cell extracts…
19444940	Occipital cortex activation studied with simultaneous recordings of functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) and visual evoked potential (VEP) in cognitively normal human subjects: effect of healthy aging.	aging	2009-03-06	We evaluated effect of aging, gender and eye (sighting) dominance on relationship between visual evoked flow response (VEFR) and visual evoked potential (VEP), which refers to neurovascular coupling. The VEFR was defined as a percentage increase of the ratio of mean blood flow velocity in the contralateral (according to the side of dominant eye processing) posterior cerebral artery P2 segment to those in ipsilateral middle cerebral artery from the baseline during half-field stimulation. Vasoneural coupling index (CI) was defined as "100 x VEFR/VEP P100 amplitude". Compared to the healthy elderly subjects (n: 19; female/male: 6/13, mean age: 69.7 +/- 7), younger participants (n: 28; female/male: 16/12; mean age: 31.1 +/- 4.7) had significantly higher VEFR for both sides: 18.9 +/- 6.7% versus 11.2 +/- 6.7%, p < 0.001 and 17.3 +/- 7.7% versus 11.8 +/- 5.5%, p: 0.007, for the hemisphere contralateral to dominant and nondominant eye (D and ND side), respectively. Albeit absence of any corre…
9143547	Laser Doppler flux characteristics at the skin of the dorsum of the foot in young and in elderly healthy human subjects.	aging	1997-03-??	In aged human subjects the cutaneous circulation has shown reduced vasoreactive capacity when stimulated by heat or ischemia, and autonomic dysfunction developing in the elderly was suggested. Should this autonomic dysfunction affect the arteriolar vasomotional activity, it might be demonstrated by laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) at rest. LDF flow motion characteristics at the dorsal foot skin were investigated under resting conditions in two subject groups differing in age. The younger group (n = 27, aged 25-29 years) showed a resting flux of 3.0 +/- 1.0 Arbitrary Units (AU) and a flux amplitude of 0.34 +/- 0.13 AU. In the elderly group (n = 22, aged 60-92 years) both these values were significantly (P < 0.05) lower (2.4 +/- 0.5 and 0.18 +/- 0.05 AU, respectively). The flux frequency, on the contrary, was similar in both age groups: 4.9 cycles min-1. We conclude that the mean resting flux and the mean flow motion amplitude under resting conditions at the skin of the dorsum of the foot a…
27912852	Old age and vulnerability between first, second and third person perspectives. Ethnographic explorations of aging in contemporary Denmark.	aging	2016-12-??	This paper is based on an ethnographic fieldwork aimed at exploring ethnographically how vulnerability in old age is perceived and experienced in contemporary Denmark. The fieldwork showed remarkable differences between two phases of the fieldwork: the first addressing vulnerability from the "outside" through group interviews with professionals, leaders and older people who were not (yet) vulnerable; and the second from the "inside" through more in depth fieldwork with older people who in diverse ways could be seen as vulnerable. After a short introduction to anthropological and social gerontological literature on characteristics of "Western" aging: medicalization, successful, healthy and active aging, I present findings from both phases of this ethnographic fieldwork arguing that the ethnographic approach reveals the composite and complex nature of vulnerability in old age and the constant interactions between first, second and third person perspectives. Through these methodological a…
18262360	Coupling and irregularity in the aging motor system: tremor and movement.	aging	2008-03-12	This experiment examined the hypothesis that aging reduces the coupling between system components, resulting in a loss of complexity in behavior. Young (18-23 years), old (60-65 years), and older old (70-75 years) subjects performed rhythmical movement and postural tasks with the index finger. Irregularity of the acceleration dynamics was lower during postural tremor and movement in the old and older old subjects, an age effect that was only observed on the mediolateral axis of motion. Coupling across the axes of motion was significantly higher during rhythmic movement in the elderly but remained unaltered across the tasks in the young adults. The results show that the loss of complexity with aging can be detected even in healthy 60-65-year-olds, but demonstrates the need for postural tremor to be examined on more than a single axis of motion. Our findings suggest that reduced motor adaptability with aging results from a greater demand on task-related reorganization of the motor output…
2233821	Hyperoxia-induced clonogenic killing of HeLa cells associated with respiratory failure and selective inactivation of Krebs cycle enzymes.	aging	????-??-??	Cellular intoxication by elevated concentrations of O2 may be considered as a model for accelerated cellular aging processes resulting from excessive free radical production by normal metabolic pathways. We describe here that exposure of HeLa cell cultures to 80% O2 for 2 days causes progressive growth inhibition and loss of reproductive capacity. This intoxication was correlated with inhibition of cellular O2 consumption and inactivation of 3 mitochondrial flavoproteins, i.e., partial inactivation of NADH and succinate dehydrogenases and total inactivation of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. As alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase controls the influx of glutamine/glutamate into the Krebs cycle, which is the major pathway for oxidative ATP generation in HeLa cells, the inactivation of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was expectedly correlated with a net fall in glutamine/glutamate utilization. Furthermore, a simultaneous increase in glucose consumption and lactate production was observ…
19534036	Systemic hemodynamic changes in elderly hypertensive patients after ingesting foods with lipid, protein, and carbohydrate contents.	aging	2009-05-??	Aging is associated with changes in cardiovascular structure and function, which predisposes elderly people to reduced blood pressure levels after meals. The authors studied cardiac systolic function in elderly hypertensive patients after eating meals with different contents of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Ten elderly male hypertensive patients were studied (mean age, 69 years; range 60-80 years). No patients had a previous history of orthostatic or postprandial hypotension. Patients ate 1 of 3 pre-prepared meals: lipid meal (LM), protein meal (PM), or carbohydrate meal (CM), on different days. Mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance index (TPRi), cardiac index (CI), and stroke index were recorded at the end of the fasting period and then at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after food ingestion. After ingestion of a CM, the CI increased from 2.30 +/- 0.21 L/ min /m(2) to 2.61 +/- 0.24 L/ min /m(2) and the TPRi decreased from 3212 +/- 226 dynes / sec(2) to 2793 +/- 255 …
16611699	The effect of aging on anaerobic and aerobic enzyme activities in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2006-04-??	The effect of aging on metabolic enzyme activity remains controversial, possibly due to physical activity differences. We examined the effect of aging on the enzyme activity for anaerobic and aerobic pathways in nonweight-bearing human skeletal muscle from relatively sedentary males. The muscle obliquus internus abdominis was analyzed for anaerobic (creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) and aerobic (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase) enzyme activities in two groups: middle-aged (29-54 years) and older (61-74 years) adults. All enzyme activities were lower in older versus middle-aged adults when results were expressed as muscle wet weight (p <.05). When activity was expressed relative to the protein content, only lactate dehydrogenase remained significantly lower in older versus middle-aged adults (p <.001). In conclusion, some of the reduction in muscle performance in older adults may be due to lower activity of the anaerobic and ae…
22230488	Effect of age on exercise-induced alterations in cognitive executive function: relationship to cerebral perfusion.	aging	2012-08-??	Regular exercise improves the age-related decline in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and is associated with improved cognitive function; however, less is known about the direct relationship between CBF and cognitive function. We examined the influence of healthy aging on the capability of acute exercise to improve cognition, and whether exercise-induced improvements in cognition are related to CBF and cortical hemodynamics. Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv; Doppler) and cortical hemodynamics (NIRS) were measured in 13 young (24±5 y) and 9 older (62±3 y) participants at rest and during cycling at 30% and 70% of heart rate range (HRR). Cognitive performance was assessed using a computer-adapted Stroop task (i.e., test of executive function cognition) at rest and during exercise. Average response times on the Stroop task were slower for the older compared to younger group for both simple and difficult tasks (P<0.01). Independent of age, difficult-task response times improved dur…
8561053	Utility of creatinine excretion in body-composition studies of healthy men and women older than 60 y.	aging	1996-02-??	This study evaluated whether aging alters the usefulness of creatinine excretion as an index of lean body mass (LBM) or muscle mass in healthy men and women. Creatinine excretion was determined while 24 young (15 men and 9 women aged < 32 y) and 38 older (23 men and 15 women aged > 60 y) healthy volunteers stayed at a clinical research center for 3 d. Total LBM was determined by 40K counting in all subjects, and cross-sectional areas of upper arm and thigh muscles were determined in some subjects (10 young, 20 old) by magnetic resonance imaging. The slopes and intercepts of the regression equations relating LBM to average daily creatinine excretion were the same in the younger and older groups, and the precision with which LBM could be determined from creatinine excretion was not diminished by aging. Creatinine excretion was closely correlated with cross-sectional areas of upper arm (r = 0.85) and thigh (r = 0.88) muscles, and the slopes and intercepts of the regression equations were …
26578457	Effects of age on the amplitude, frequency and perceived quality of voice.	aging	2015-12-??	The manner and extent to which voice amplitude and frequency control mechanisms change with age is not well understood. The related question of whether the assessment of one's own voice evolves with age, concomitant with the acoustical changes that the voice undergoes, also remains unanswered. In the present study, we characterized the aging of voice production mechanisms (amplitude, frequency), compared the aging voice in different experimental contexts (vowel utterance, connected speech) and examined the relationship between voice self-assessment and age-related voice acoustical changes. Eighty healthy adults (20 to 75 years old) participated in the study, which involved computation of several acoustical measures of voice (including measures of fundamental frequency, voice amplitude, and stability) as well as self-assessments of voice. Because depression is frequent in older adults, depression and anxiety scores were also measured. As was expected, analyses revealed age effects on mo…
27516537	Improved single muscle fiber quality in the oldest-old.	aging	2016-??-01	We examined single muscle fiber contractile function of the oldest-old (3F/2M, 89 ± 1 yr old) enrolled in The Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (The Health ABC Study). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained and single muscle fiber function was determined (n = 105) prior to myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform identification with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cross-sectional area of MHC I muscle fibers (5,576 ± 333 μm; n = 58) was 21% larger (P < 0.05) than MHC IIa fibers (4,518 ± 386 μm; n = 47). Normalized power (an indicator of muscle fiber quality incorporating size, strength, and speed) of MHC I and IIa muscle fibers was 2.3 ± 0.1 and 17.4 ± 0.8 W/l, respectively. Compared with previous research from our lab using identical procedures, MHC I normalized power was 28% higher than healthy 20 yr olds and similar to younger octogenarians (∼80 yr old). Normalized power of MHC IIa fibers was 63% greater than 20 yr olds and 39% greater than younger …
17191437	Knowledge of memory aging in adulthood.	aging	2006-??-??	The Knowledge of Memory Aging Questionnaire (KMAQ) measures laypersons' knowledge of memory changes in adulthood for research or educational purposes. Half of the questions pertain to normal memory aging and the other half cover pathological memory deficits due to non-normative factors, such as adult dementia. In this study, we compared memory knowledge in middle age adults (40-59 years), young-old adults (60-79 years) and very old adults (80 years and over). These data were collected as a part of the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study, a multidisciplinary population-based study that examines the determinants of healthy aging in adulthood. Results indicated that very old adults performed more poorly overall. Follow-up analyses revealed that they endorsed stereotyped views of normal memory aging more often than did the other age groups. Analyses of response accuracy by gender yielded comparable performance for men and women. Implications for research and the design of educational programs ar…
25909849	Reduced Haemodynamic Response in the Ageing Visual Cortex Measured by Absolute fNIRS.	aging	2015-??-??	The effect of healthy ageing on visual cortical activation is still to be fully explored. This study aimed to elucidate whether the haemodynamic response (HDR) of the visual cortex altered as a result of ageing. Visually normal (healthy) participants were presented with a simple visual stimulus (reversing checkerboard). Full optometric screening was implemented to identify two age groups: younger adults (n = 12, mean age 21) and older adults (n = 13, mean age 71). Frequency-domain Multi-distance (FD-MD) functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure absolute changes in oxygenated [HbO] and deoxygenated [HbR] haemoglobin concentrations in the occipital cortices. Utilising a slow event-related design, subjects viewed a full field reversing checkerboard with contrast and check size manipulations (15 and 30 minutes of arc, 50% and 100% contrast). Both groups showed the characteristic response of increased [HbO] and decreased [HbR] during stimulus presentation. However, o…
597637	Effect of growth and aging on the static mechanical lung properties.	aging	????-??-??	Quasi-static expiratory pressure-volume curves were obtained in 119 healthy subjects 7 to 64 years old. Lung recoil pressures were measured at six fixed percentages of TLC between 100 percent and 50 percent. In children and adolescents lung recoil pressures increased with growth till about the age of fifteen and there were no differences between sexes. In adults less than 40 years old there was also no sex difference in lung recoil pressures, whereas in subjects more than 40 years old, females had lower recoil pressures than males at every level of TLC. Both in males and females, aging is associated with a marked decrease of lung recoil pressures. Smoking had no detectable effect on lung recoil in males. During growth the evolution of static compliance was closely related to height, whereas in adults this relationship was less evident particularly in males. There was no sex differences in specific compliance which tended to increase slightly with aging.
30390251	mTOR Signaling Pathway and Protein Synthesis: From Training to Aging and Muscle Autophagy.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	In muscle tissue there is a balance between the processes muscle synthesis and degradation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis in order to maintain muscular protein turnover and trophism. Studies have shown that both down- and upregulation mechanisms are involved in this process in a manner dependent on stimulus and cellular conditions. Additionally, mTOR signaling has recently been implicated in several physiological conditions related to cell survival, such as self-digestion (autophagy), energy production, and the preservation of cellular metabolic balance over the lifespan. Here we briefly describe the mTOR structure and its regulatory protein synthesis pathway. Furthermore, the role of mTOR protein in autophagy, aging, and mitochondrial function in muscle tissue is presented.
20960572	Reduced somatosensory activations in swallowing with age.	aging	2011-05-??	Understanding the neural functional organization of swallowing in healthy elders is essential in diagnosing and treating older adults with swallowing difficulties. The primary aims of this investigation were to identify the neural activation sites of different components of deglutition in healthy elders using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and to investigate age differences in the neural control of swallowing. Ten young (age range 19-25 years of age) and nine older (age range 66-77 years of age) right-handed healthy individuals were scanned in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. Subjects were visually cued for both a "Swallow" task and for component/control tasks ("Prepare to swallow," "Tap your tongue," and "Clear your throat"). Behavioral interleaved gradient (BIG) methodology was used to address movement related artifacts. Between-group comparisons revealed statistically stronger activations in the primary somatosensory cortex of young adults during the motor tasks examined. Both g…
29943239	The effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) on motor cortex excitability in young and elderly adults.	aging	2018-10-??	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate brain oscillations, cortical excitability and behaviour. In aging, the decrease in EEG alpha activity (8-12 Hz) in the parieto-occipital and mu rhythm in the motor cortex are correlated with the decline in cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Increasing alpha activity using tACS might therefore improve cognitive and motor function in the elderly. The present study explored the influence of tACS on cortical excitability in young and old healthy adults. We applied tACS at individual alpha peak frequency for 10 min (1.5 mA) to the left motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the changes in cortical excitability as measured by motor-evoked potentials at rest, before and after stimulation. TACS increased cortical excitability in both groups. However, our results also suggest that the mechanism behind the effects was different, as we observed an increase and decrease in intracortical inhibitio…
19442747	MRI estimates of brain iron concentration in normal aging: comparison of field-dependent (FDRI) and phase (SWI) methods.	aging	2009-08-15	Different brain structures accumulate iron at different rates throughout the adult life span. Typically, striatal and brain stem structures are higher in iron concentrations in older than younger adults, whereas cortical white matter and thalamus have lower concentrations in the elderly than young adults. Brain iron can be measured in vivo with MRI by estimating the relaxivity increase across magnetic field strengths, which yields the Field-Dependent Relaxation Rate Increase (FDRI) metric. The influence of local iron deposition on susceptibility, manifests as MR phase effects, forms the basis for another approach for iron measurement, Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI), for which imaging at only one field strength is sufficient. Here, we compared the ability of these two methods to detect and quantify brain iron in 11 young (5 men, 6 women; 21 to 29 years) and 12 elderly (6 men, 6 women; 64 to 86 years) healthy adults. FDRI was acquired at 1.5 T and 3.0 T, and SWI was acquired at 1.…
2100548	Change in sphingomyelinase activity in human epidermis during aging.	aging	1990-03-??	We have investigated the change in activity of sphingomyelinase in human whole epidermis during aging. The sphingomyelinase activity gradually decreased with the aging process; that of people aged eighty decreased to one fourth of that of people aged twenty in same area. This result indicates that the lipid metabolism may be altered in the epidermis during aging.
26375206	The Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data repository: Structural and functional MRI, MEG, and cognitive data from a cross-sectional adult lifespan sample.	lifespan, aging	2017-??-??	This paper describes the data repository for the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) initial study cohort. The Cam-CAN Stage 2 repository contains multi-modal (MRI, MEG, and cognitive-behavioural) data from a large (approximately N=700), cross-sectional adult lifespan (18-87years old) population-based sample. The study is designed to characterise age-related changes in cognition and brain structure and function, and to uncover the neurocognitive mechanisms that support healthy cognitive ageing. The database contains raw and preprocessed structural MRI, functional MRI (active tasks and resting state), and MEG data (active tasks and resting state), as well as derived scores from cognitive behavioural experiments spanning five broad domains (attention, emotion, action, language, and memory), and demographic and neuropsychological data. The dataset thus provides a depth of neurocognitive phenotyping that is currently unparalleled, enabling integrative analyses of age-rel…
711580	Relaxed +GZ tolerance in healthy men: effect of age.	aging	1978-10-??	Fifty-three healthy US Air Force aircrewmen, 26-55 yr old, volunteered for a centrifuge study designed to determine the effect of age on relaxed +GZ tolerance. Each was subjected to G forces of gradual and rapid onset, with G tolerance determined by standardized contraction of peripheral visual fields. Of the subject characteristics studied, only age was positively correlated with rapid-onset G tolerance; both age and weight were positively correlated with gradual-onset G tolerance. A combination of age and weight gave a stronger positive correlation with G tolerance (rapid- and gradual-onset) than did either characteristic alone. No significant negative correlations were observed. We conclude that aging may offer some protection from G stress; there is no evidence that aging leads to a decrement in G tolerance.
23945551	Body composition, muscle capacity, and physical function in older adults: an integrated conceptual model.	aging	2014-07-??	The aging process leads to adverse changes in body composition (increases in fat mass and decreases in skeletal muscle mass), declines in physical function (PF), and ultimately increased risk for disability and loss of independence. Specific components of body composition or muscle capacity (strength and power) may be useful in predicting PF; however, findings have been mixed regarding the most salient predictor of PF. The development of a conceptual model potentially aids in understanding the interrelated factors contributing to PF with the factors of interest being physical activity, body composition, and muscle capacity. This article also highlights sex differences in these domains. Finally, factors known to affect PF, such as sleep, depression, fatigue, and self-efficacy, are discussed. Development of a comprehensive conceptual model is needed to better characterize the most salient factors contributing to PF and to subsequently inform the development of interventions to reduce phy…
28247210	Age-related effects on maximal and rapid hamstrings/quadriceps strength capacities and vertical jump power in young and older females.	aging	2017-12-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Declines in hamstrings and quadriceps maximal and rapid strength are commonly reported as a consequence of aging; however, few studies have investigated the influence of age on maximal and rapid hamstrings to quadriceps (H/Q) strength ratios. This study aimed to examine the effects of age on leg extension and flexion maximal and rapid torque production, H/Q strength ratios, and muscle power in healthy, young and old females.    METHODS: Fifteen young (21 ± 2 years) and 15 old (69 ± 7 years) females performed 3 isometric leg extension and flexion maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), from which peak torque (PT), early (0-30 ms) and late (0-200 ms) phase rate of torque development (RTD), and PT and RTD H/Q strength ratios were extracted. Lower-body peak power output (P ) was assessed through a vertical jump test.    RESULTS: P , PT, and early (RTD30) and late (RTD200) RTD variables of the leg extensors and flexors were lower (P ≤ 0.048) and PT and RTD200 H/Q strengt…
25213460	Implications of changes in households and living arrangements for future home-based care needs and costs for disabled elders in China.	aging	2015-04-??	OBJECTIVES: To better understand future home-based care needs and costs for disabled elders in China.    METHOD: To further develop and apply the ProFamy extended cohort-component method and the most recent census and survey data.    RESULTS: (a) Chinese disabled elders and the annual growth rate of the percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to home-based care costs for disabled elders will increase much more rapidly than the growth of total elderly population; (b) home-based care needs and costs for disabled oldest-old aged 80+ will increase much faster than that for disabled young-old aged 65-79 after 2030; (c) disabled unmarried elders living alone and their home-based care costs increase substantially faster than those disabled unmarried elders living with children; (d) percent of rural disabled oldest-old will be substantially higher than that of rural population after 2030; (e) sensitivity analyses show that possible changes in mortality and elderly disabilit…
29878838	Ecologically relevant episodic memory assessment indicates an attenuated age-related memory loss - A virtual reality study.	aging	2018-09-??	OBJECTIVES: Since the advent of imaging techniques, the role of the neuropsychological assessment has changed. Questions concerning everyday functionality became primarily important and, thus, ecologically valid neuropsychological assessments are mandatory. Virtual reality (VR) environments might provide a way of implementing immersive cognitive assessments with a higher degree of everyday-life-related cognitive demands.    METHOD: We report on a VR-based episodic memory examination in N = 30 young and N = 18 healthy older adults (HOA) using a kitchen scene. The test procedure was designed to be structurally comparable to clinically used California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) in terms of repeated learning trials as well as short and long delayed recall measures.    RESULTS: The results showed that age-related learning and performance decrements were mainly evident in the CVLT but not in the VR-memory examination.    CONCLUSIONS: The ecologically valid VR-memory examination might provid…
4079824	Fertility in aging men.	aging	1985-09-??	A wide variety of disorders, medications, physical factors, and trauma can alter testicular function and reproductive function in men as they age. There are no precise age limits for 'aging men', but most studies consider 50-80-yr-old subjects. Assuming we have healthy individuals, there are still changes that occur with aging. There is progressive testicular failure as evidenced by gradually increasing levels of both gonadotropins with aging. Although basal levels of male hormone remain reasonably normal in healthy older men, the ability of the Leydig cells to respond to acute stimulation with LH is reduced. There are changes in the penis, prostate, and seminal vesicle which occur with aging. Potency tends to be reduced with age. Sperm production per testis falls off with aging. The amount of capsular tissue increases in the testis with advancing years. There is very limited data about men in extreme old age (80 yr and older). Of older men who produce spermatozoa in their ejaculates, …
29188896	Vitamin B12 and Homocysteine Associations with Gait Speed in Older Adults: The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the independent associations of serum levels of vitamin B12 and plasma concentrations of homocysteine with gait speed decline.    DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This study utilized longitudinal analysis of participants 50 years or older from The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, N=774.    MEASUREMENTS: Gait speed (m/s) was assessed using the 6-meter usual pace test. Vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations were collected using standard clinical protocols. Linear mixed effects regression was stratified by baseline age category (50-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years old).    RESULTS: Mean follow-up time for the total study sample was 5.4 ± 2.0 years. No association between vitamin B12 and gait speed decline over the follow-up time for any age group was found. Elevated homocysteine concentrations were associated with decline in gait speed after adjustment for covariates (50-69: β= -0.005, p=.057; 70-79: β= -0.013, p<.001, ≥80: β= -0.007, p=.054).    CO…
24268755	Age-related changes in posture response under a continuous and unexpected perturbation.	aging	2014-01-22	Aging is a critical factor to influence the functional performance during daily life. Without an appropriate posture control response when experiencing an unexpected external perturbation, fall may occur. A novel six-degree-of freedom platform with motion control protocol was designed to provide a real-life simulation of unexpected disturbance in order to discriminate the age-related changes of the balance control and the recovery ability. Twenty older adults and 20 healthy young adults participated in the study. The subjects stood barefoot on the novel movable platform, data of the center of mass (COM) excursion, joint rotation angle and electromyography (EMG) were recorded and compared. The results showed that the older adults had similar patterns of joint movement and COM excursion as the young adults during the balance reactive-recovery. However, larger proximal joint rotation in elderly group induced larger COM sway envelop and therefore loss of the compensatory strategy of postur…
15319361	Impaired anabolic response of muscle protein synthesis is associated with S6K1 dysregulation in elderly humans.	aging	2004-10-??	Age-related loss of muscle protein may involve a decreased response to anabolic factors of muscle protein synthesis through dysregulation of translation factors. To verify this hypothesis, we simultaneously investigated muscle protein synthesis and expression of some factors implicated in insulin signal transduction during hyperinsulinemia and hyperaminoacidemia in 6 young (25+/-1 year; mean+/-sem) and 8 elderly subjects (72+/-2 year). Incorporation of L-[1-13C] leucine in muscle proteins (fractional synthesis rate, FSR) was measured in vastus lateralis, before and during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic hyperaminoacidemic clamp, together with Western blot analysis of protein kinase B (PKB), mTOR, 4E-BP1, and S6K1 phosphorylation. In basal state, muscle protein FSR was reduced in elderly in comparison with young subjects (0.061+/-0.004% per hour) vs 0.082+/-0.010% per hour, elderly vs. young, P<0.05). During clamp, muscle protein FSR was stimulated in young (0.119+/-0.006% per hour; P<0.0…
28378095	Measurement of muscle health in aging.	lifespan	2017-??-??	Muscle health is a critical component in the struggle against physical frailty and the efforts to maintain metabolic health until the limit of chronological age. Consensus opinion is to evaluate muscle health in terms of muscle mass, strength and functional capability. There has been considerable variability in the components of muscle health which have been investigated in addition to variability in the tools of assessment and protocol for measurement. This is in stark contrast to the validated measurement of bone health across the adult life span. The purpose of this review was to identify indices of muscle mass, strength and functional capability most responsive to change with ageing and where possible to provide an estimate of the rate of change. We suggest lean tissue mass (LTM) or skeletal muscle (SM) is best evaluated from the thigh region due to its greater responsiveness to ageing compared to the whole body. The anterior compartment of the thigh region undergoes a preferential…
10795719	Effects of strength training and detraining on muscle quality: age and gender comparisons.	aging	2000-03-??	Maximal force production per unit of muscle mass (muscle quality, or MQ) has been used to describe the relative contribution of non-muscle-mass components to the changes in strength with age and strength training (ST). To compare the influence of age and gender on MQ response to ST and detraining, 11 young men (20-30 years), nine young women (20-30 years), 11 older men (65-75 years), and 11 older women (65-75 years), were assessed for quadriceps MQ at baseline, after 9 weeks of ST, and after 31 weeks of detraining. MQ was calculated by dividing quadriceps one repetition maximum (IRM) strength by quadriceps muscle volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging. All groups demonstrated significant increases in IRM strength and muscle volume after training (all p < .05). All groups also increased their MQ with training (all p < .01), but the gain in MQ was significantly greater in young women than in the other three groups (p < .05). After 31 weeks of detraining, MQ values remained signi…
10023578	Are age differences in sleep due to phase differences in the output of the circadian timing system?	aging	1999-01-??	Our aim was to evaluate whether age-related changes in the phase of the output of the circadian timing system (CTS) can explain age differences in habitual bedtime/wake time and in sleep consolidation parameters. Analyses focused on a group of healthy elderly people (older than 70 years) with no sleep problems and with similar subjective sleep quality as a young control group. The 2-week sleep diary data and 24h laboratory temperature recordings were examined for 70 subjects (22 young men [YM], 19 old men [OM], 29 old women [OW]). Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep data recorded during temperature data acquisition were also available for 62 subjects. These analyses made use of our recently developed technique to demask temperature rhythm data. As expected, compared to the young subjects, older subjects showed earlier habitual bedtime and wake time, more disturbed sleep, and a tendency for an earlier minimum of the circadian temperature rhythm. Despite sleep consolidation differences, the gro…
20572436	Lip-closing function of elderly people during ingestion: comparison with young adults.	aging	2009-11-??	In this study the relationship between the functional vertical labial pressure and aging during ingestion in the elderly is examined. The subjects were 84 community-dwelling elderly (mean: 79.4 years old), 109 elderly needing long term care (mean: 81.3 years old), and 59 healthy young adults (mean: 32.0 years old) as control. Labial pressure was measured with a pressure sensor embedded in acrylic plate. There was no correlation between age and labial pressure or the coefficient of variation of labial pressure during ingestion. In people with a history of "choking on food", labial pressure was, however, significantly lower (p < 0.01) than people without a history of "choking on food", while the coefficient of variation of labial pressure was significantly higher (p < 0.05). Poor labial pressure and movement were noted in subjects who experienced "choking on food", suggesting that lip-closing function also plays an important role in the pharyngeal stage of feeding/swallowing. On the othe…
27507687	Rationales for Anti-aging Activities in Middle Age: Aging, Health, or Appearance?	aging	2018-03-19	Purpose: We explore the motivations of middle-aged consumers of anti-aging products and services in relation to aging, health, and appearance. Admission of use of anti-aging products and services could align a respondent with a stigmatized group, old people, and also connotes a feminine concern with aesthetics. For these reasons, people, particularly men, will be unlikely to report using them for this purpose.    Design and Methods: Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted among 19 men and women aged 42-61 years. Topics included their perceptions of bodily changes and their responses to these. We analyzed data qualitatively.    Results: Respondents frame their uses of anti-aging products in terms of health and appearance, not anti-aging per se. Both men and women see anti-aging as related to beautiful appearance and thus as a feminized activity. Both are concerned about appearance, but in gendered ways. Overall, respondents conflate bodily appearance, health, and aging in th…
19631626	Normative data on development of neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying attention orienting toward social-emotional stimuli: an exploratory study.	aging	2009-10-06	The ability of positive and negative facial signals to influence attention orienting is crucial to social functioning. Given the dramatic developmental change in neural architecture supporting social function, positive and negative facial cues may influence attention orienting differently in relatively young or old individuals. However, virtually no research examines such age-related differences in the neural circuitry supporting attention orienting to emotional faces. We examined age-related correlations in attention-orienting biases to positive and negative face emotions in a healthy sample (N=37; 9-40 years old) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a dot-probe task. The dot-probe task in an fMRI setting yields both behavioral and neural indices of attention biases towards or away from an emotional cue (happy or angry face). In the full sample, angry-face attention bias scores did not correlate with age, and age did not correlate with brain activation to angry faces. Howev…
28004951	Age-related impairment on a forced-choice version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task.	aging	2017-??-??	Previous studies from our lab have indicated that healthy older adults are impaired in their ability to mnemonically discriminate between previously viewed objects and similar lure objects in the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). These studies have used either old/similar/new or old/new test formats. The forced-choice test format (e.g., "Did you see object A or object A' during the encoding phase?") relies on different assumptions than the old/new test format (e.g., "Did you see this object during the encoding phase?"); hence, converging evidence from these approaches would bolster the conclusion that healthy aging is accompanied by impaired performance on the MST. Consistent with our hypothesis, healthy older adults exhibited impaired performance on a forced-choice test format that required discriminating between a target and a similar lure. We also tested the hypothesis that age-related impairments on the MST could be modeled within a global matching computational framework. We found t…
19008462	Impaired tactile acuity in old age is accompanied by enlarged hand representations in somatosensory cortex.	aging	2009-07-??	The representations of the human hand in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) undergo continuous adaptational plastic processes, which arise from learning, altered use, or injury. The resulting reorganization affects size, extent, and position of the cortical maps, which parallels alterations of tactile behavior indicating a close relationship between map changes and perception. Here we investigate the influence of healthy aging on the cortical hand representation and on age-related changes of tactile performance. Using somatosensory evoked potential mapping in combination with electric source localization, we found that in elderly subjects aged 60-85 years the distance between the dipoles of the index and the little fingers increased indicating an expansion of the representations within SI by approximately 40%. Assessment of tactile spatial 2-point discrimination thresholds in the same subjects showed a strong decline with age. These results indicate that healthy aging strongly affects t…
1825842	D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in human substantia nigra: localization and the effect of aging.	aging	1991-04-??	D1 and D2 receptor densities in human substantia nigra were examined by use of the specific binding of, respectively, [3H]SCH 23390 [R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-[3H]methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3- benzazepine] and [3H]spiperone. A unilateral loss of striato- and pallidonigral pathways by an infarction (n = 4) had no effect on the ipsilateral nigral D2 receptors, but reduced the ipsilateral nigral D1 receptors by 48-60% compared with the intact side. These data suggest that a substantial fraction of D1 receptors in human substantia nigra is located on terminals of striato- and/or pallidonigral neurons, whereas D2 receptors are confined to intrinsic nigral cells. We also examined the effect of aging on the D1 and D2 receptors in substantia nigra obtained from 25 postmortem human brains (age range 19-88 years). The densities of both receptor types were not affected by the aging process. Since nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate with aging, these results suggest either tha…
10435774	The effect of age and pre-light melatonin concentration on the melatonin sensitivity to dim light.	aging	1999-05-??	The hormone melatonin is secreted at night from the pineal gland, with light being a potent inhibitor of its secretion. Age related decreases in plasma melatonin concentrations have indicated that this may be related to pineal calcification with aging. Recently, it was shown that the melatonin sensitivity to light may be a biological marker of bipolar disorder. However, on average, patients were older than the control group in most studies, and it is not known if age has an effect on the melatonin suppression by light. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the effect of age on the melatonin sensitivity to dim light (200 lux). Participants were grouped into three age groups. On the testing night, they were placed in a dark room from 21.00 h to 02.30 h. Light exposure was for an hour from midnight to 01.00 h. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for measurement of plasma melatonin. No significant differences were found in the percentage suppression of melat…
12589778	Loss of melanin from human RPE with aging: possible role of melanin photooxidation.	aging	2003-01-??	The pigment melanin, which is believed to play a photoprotective role, was quantified here in human RPE cells from donors of different age. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was shown to provide a quantitative measure of melanin and was used as a non-destructive measure of melanin content. Results indicated an age-related melanin loss in RPE cells, with melanin content diminishing 2.5-fold between the first and the ninth decade of life. To determine whether photo-oxidation may contribute to age-related changes in RPE melanin, RPE in human eyecups, isolated human and bovine RPE cells, purified melanin granules, or synthetic dopa melanin were irradiated with various wavelengths and intensities of visible light. Samples were analysed for changes in melanin content by ESR spectroscopy, and by absorption and emission spectrophotometry. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured in some samples, and some human eyecups were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Irrad…
27761888	A lifelong competitive training practice attenuates age-related lipid peroxidation.	aging	2017-02-??	The effect of exercise-induced oxidative stress on health and aging is not clearly explained. This study examined the effects of habitual sport practice, age, and submaximal exercise on the blood markers of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and antioxidant response. Seventy-two healthy men were grouped by their habitual sport practice: inactive (<1.5 h/week), recreational (3-8 h/week), and trained athletes (>8 h/week), and further divided by age: young (18-25 years), adult (40-55 years), and senior (>55 years). Blood samples were collected at rest and after submaximal effort. Hydroperoxides and superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities were measured by spectrophotometry. Nuclear DNA damage was analyzed by comet assay. The alpha-actin release was analyzed by Western blot. Alpha-tocopherol, retinol, and coenzyme-Q10 were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Data was analyzed through a factorial ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test. L…
21746736	Age-related striatal dopaminergic denervation and severity of a slip perturbation.	aging	2011-09-??	BACKGROUND: Striatal dopamine activity declines with normal aging. Age-related striatal dopaminergic denervation (SDD) has been implicated in standing balance and unperturbed gait. The goal of this study was to analyze the association between the degree of SDD and the magnitude of an unexpected slip perturbation induced during gait.    METHODS: Fifty healthy participants aged 20-86 years old underwent dopamine transporter positron emission tomography to classify SDD severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Participants also walked on a floor that was unexpectedly contaminated with a glycerol solution for gait testing. The magnitude of a slip was quantified using the peak slip velocity (PSV), measured at the slipping foot. Data were analyzed for both fast (greater than 1.2 m/s) and slow walkers as gait speed correlated with slip severity. All data analyses were age adjusted.    RESULTS: Greater severity of dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus was correlated with higher PSV (p <…
29096226	Comparing the loss of functional independence of older adults in the U.S. and China.	longevity	2018-01-??	BACKGROUND: Functional loss among older adults is known to follow a hierarchical sequence, but little is known about whether such sequences differ across socio-cultural contexts. The aim of this study is to construct activities of daily livings (ADL) scales for oldest-old adults in the United States and China so as to compare their functional loss sequences.    METHODS: We use data from the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (n=1607) and Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n=5570) for years 1998-2008. ADL items are calibrated within a scale using the Rasch measurement model. Rasch scores are averaged across survey waves to identify the ADL loss sequence for each study population. We also assess scale stability over measurement periods.    RESULTS: Factor analyses confirm that the ADL items in each study population can be combined meaningfully to form a hierarchical sequence. Internal consistency assessed by Cronbach's alpha is high (0.81 to 0.95). We find that bathi…
22483339	Serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein level and risk of cognitive impairment in older women.	aging	2013-02-??	We investigated the association between serum level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and risk of cognitive impairment (dementia or mild cognitive impairment) among 572 nondemented community-dwelling women from a prospective cohort study of aging. After 5 years of follow-up, 228 (39.9%) developed cognitive impairment; and this did not differ by tertile of baseline oxLDL level (highest compared with lowest tertile 38.2% vs. 39.5%; odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.43). Multivariate adjustment produced similar results (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.39). These findings suggest that increased levels of serum oxLDL are not associated with a greater risk of incident cognitive impairment in older women.
12903065	Growth and aging of facial soft tissues: A computerized three-dimensional mesh diagram analysis.	aging	2003-09-??	The normal growth, development, and aging of facial soft tissues was studied by three-dimensional (3D) computerized mesh diagram analysis. The 3D coordinates of 50 soft-tissue landmarks were collected from 591 healthy white northern Italians (351 males, 240 females) 6-40 years of age. For each gender and age class, mean values were computed, and a standardized mesh of equidistant horizontal, vertical, and anterior-posterior lines was constructed. Within each age group, male meshes were superimposed on female meshes. For each gender, the 6-year-old reference mesh was superimposed on the reference mesh of each age group. The global (size plus shape) difference was evaluated by calculating the relevant displacement vectors for each landmark. Consequently, a size normalization was carried out and the shape difference was evaluated by calculating new relevant displacement vectors for each landmark. Growth and development were different along the three spatial planes: the largest increment w…
26633310	A Population-based Investigation of Circadian Rhythm of Intraocular Pressure in Habitual Position Among Healthy Subjects: The Handan Eye Study.	aging	2016-??-??	PURPOSE: (1) To investigate the reference value of peak-trough difference in circadian rhythm of intraocular pressure (IOP) in habitual position and (2) to compare the IOP parameters among 3 age groups.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Habitual IOP of healthy subjects sampled from the population in the Handan Eye Study was measured every 2 hours in the seated position during light-wake period (7:30 AM, 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 3:30 PM, 5:30 PM, 7:30 PM, 9:30 PM) and in the supine position during dark-sleep period (11:30 PM, 1:30 AM, 3:30 AM, 5:30 AM). Blood pressure and heart rate were obtained subsequently at each IOP measurement.    RESULTS: Two hundred six healthy subjects were included in the final analyses (n=20, 30 to 39 y old; n=95, 40 to 49 y old; n=91, 50 to 59 y old). For peak-trough difference (7.2±2.3 mm Hg; 6.8 to 7.5 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval) in habitual position, the reference value was described as median 7.0 mm Hg, 25th percentile 5.5 mm Hg, and 95th percentile 11.5 …
10848126	The effect of race and health-related factors on naming and memory. The MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging.	aging	2000-02-??	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the analyses was to examine the impact of health-related variables on race differences in neuropsychological functioning (Boston Naming Task).    METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from the MacArthur Successful Aging Study, the authors examined the relationship of demographic characteristics, health status, health habits, physical functioning, and speed of performance to naming and incidental recall of items from the Boston Naming Task.  Participants were 1,175 healthy African American and European American older persons 70 to 79 years old.    RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that although race differences persisted for confrontational naming after controlling for demographic and health factors, there was no effect due to race for incidental recall scores or for savings scores for recall.    DISCUSSION: The racial differences found in test performance may reflect differences in cultural appropriateness of the material rather than differences in ability…
1893901	Peak anaerobic power in master athletes.	aging	1991-??-??	The age-related decline in maximal physical performance of healthy subjects may be attributed both to the aging process per se and/or to a progressive reduction in physical activity. In two groups of master athletes, power (P) or endurance (E) trained (n = 115; aged 40-78 years), the degree and rate of the age-related deterioration of the maximal instantaneous muscle power (peak power, Wpeak), and the relative contribution of quantitative (muscle mass) and qualitative factors possibly underlying such deterioration were determined. Two groups of young athletes (n = 20; 17-26 years) and healthy untrained subjects (U, n = 37; 22-67 years) were also tested for comparison. The following two variables were assessed, firstly the lower limb muscle plus bone volume (LMV) by anthropometry, and secondly Wpeak, by means of a standardized vertical jump off both feet, performed on a force platform. The results obtained were that LMV of E and P, as well as of U, was about the same between age 20 and …
25670334	Stuck in default mode: inefficient cross-frequency synchronization may lead to age-related short-term memory decline.	aging	2015-04-??	Aging-related decline in short-term memory capacity seems to be caused by deficient balancing of task-related and resting state brain networks activity; however, the exact neural mechanism underlying this deficit remains elusive. Here, we studied brain oscillatory activity in healthy young and old adults during visual information maintenance in a delayed match-to-sample task. Particular emphasis was on long range phase:amplitude coupling of frontal alpha (8-12 Hz) and posterior fast oscillatory activity (>30 Hz). It is argued that through posterior fast oscillatory activity nesting into the excitatory or the inhibitory phase of frontal alpha wave, long-range networks can be efficiently coupled or decoupled, respectively. On the basis of this mechanism, we show that healthy, elderly participants exhibit a lack of synchronization in task-relevant networks while maintaining synchronized regions of the resting state network. Lacking disconnection of this resting state network is predictive…
26650255	The Effect of Aging and the High-Frequency Auditory Threshold on Speech-Evoked Mismatch Negativity in a Noisy Background.	aging	2016-??-??	Mismatch negativity (MMN) has been widely used to study the function of central auditory processing in the elderly. However, current research has not yet considered the effect of noise and high-frequency hearing threshold on MMN in the elderly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aging and high-frequency hearing loss on speech-related MMN in noisy backgrounds. Additionally, the possible mechanisms of central auditory processing dysfunction in the elderly were investigated. Fifty people aged 61-80 (70 ± 5.8) years were recruited for this study. They were divided into a 61- to 70-year-old group and a 71- to 80-year-old group. Fifty younger adults aged 21-40 (31 ± 5.3) years were recruited as healthy controls. Pure-tone hearing thresholds were recorded. A speech discrimination score (SDS) and a speech-evoked MMN under white noise with a bandwidth from 125 to 8,000 Hz background condition were recorded. The relationships between SDS and MMN latency and amplitude were analyz…
11528342	Influence of age on thirst and fluid intake.	aging	2001-09-??	Independently living older adults (over the age of 65 yr) consume adequate volumes of fluids on a daily basis. However, when challenged by fluid deprivation, a hyperosmotic stimulus, or exercise in a warm environment (all of which combine hypovolemia and hyperosmolality), older adults exhibit decreased thirst sensation and reduced fluid intake. Full fluid restoration eventually occurs, but full restoration of fluid balance is slowed. The aging process alters important physiological control systems associated with thirst and satiety. Recent evidence suggests that older men and women (i) have a higher baseline osmolality and thus a higher osmotic operating point for thirst sensation (with little or no change in sensitivity), and (ii) exhibit diminished thirst and satiety in response to the unloading (hypovolemia) and loading (hypervolemia) of baroreceptors. A diminished sensation of thirst in the elderly relative to young adults is generally absent when a volume stimulus is absent, despi…
17311079	Aging effects on cerebral blood and cerebrospinal fluid flows.	aging	2007-09-??	Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is a noninvasive reliable technique, which enables quantification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and total cerebral blood flows (tCBF). Although it is used to study hydrodynamic cerebral disorders in the elderly group (hydrocephalus), there is no published evaluation of aging effects on both tCBF and CSF flows, and on their mechanical coupling. Nineteen young (mean age 27+/-4 years) and 12 elderly (71+/-9 years) healthy volunteers underwent cerebral MRI using 1.5 T scanner. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence was performed at the aqueductal and cervical levels. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood flow curves were then calculated over the cardiac cycle, to extract the characteristic parameters: mean and peak flows, their latencies, and stroke volumes for CSF (cervical and aqueductal) and vascular flows. Total cerebral blood flow was (P<0.01) decreased significantly in the elderly group when compared with the young subjects …
26253187	Changes in Standing and Walking Performance Under Dual-Task Conditions Across the Lifespan.	lifespan	2015-12-??	Simultaneous performance of a postural and a concurrent task is rather unproblematic as long as the postural task is executed in an automatic way. However, in situations where postural control requires more central processing, cognitive resources may be exceeded by the addition of an attentionally demanding task. This may lead to interference between the two tasks, manifested in a decreased performance in one or both tasks (dual-task costs). Owing to changes in attentional demands of postural tasks as well as processing capacities across the lifespan, it might be assumed that dual-task costs are particularly pronounced in children and older adults probably leading to a U-shaped pattern for dual-task costs as a function of age. However, these changes in the ability of dual-tasking posture from childhood to old age have not yet been systematically reviewed. Therefore, Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched for studies comparing dual-task performance with one task being standin…
7724047	Age-dependent increases of immunoreactive imidazoline receptors in the human brain: possible association of a 29/30 kDa protein with the I2-imidazoline receptor identified by [3H]idazoxan.	aging	1995-01-23	In the postmortem human brain (15 specimens of frontal cortex), the immunodetection and quantification of imidazoline receptor (IR) proteins (29/30 and 47 kDa) and the specific binding of [3H]idazoxan to I2-IR were determined in parallel to study the effect of aging (range 3-89 years) on these proteins and its possible association. The immunoreactivity of the 29/30 kDa IR protein, similar to the I2-IR, showed a significant positive correlation with the age of the subjects at death (r = 0.54; P = 0.04). Moreover, the levels of this IR protein also correlated significantly with the density of I2-IR in the brain of the same subjects (r = 0.67; P = 0.01). It is suggested that the I2-IR labeled by [3H]idazoxan in the human brain is related to the 29/30 kDa IR protein identified by immunoblot analysis.
16383249	Age-related variations in peak cerebrospinal fluid velocities in the foramen magnum.	aging	2005-12-??	OBJECT: Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocities in the foramen magnum are used to determine the functional significance of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). Significantly higher peak velocities are found in adult patients with CM-I than in adult control participants. In addition, it appears that higher CSF velocities are found in pediatric patients with CM-I than in adult patients. Variations in CSF velocities across age groups in healthy individuals, however, have not been systematically studied.    METHODS: Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 pediatric patients after induction of anesthesia to evaluate conditions thought not to affect CSF flow in the foramen magnum. The peak systolic and diastolic velocities were plotted with respect to age and compared with velocities obtained in a group of 10 healthy adult volunteers. Differences between the adult and pediatric groups were tested for significance by using the Student t-test. Peak velocities r…
8219229	Lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cell activity in healthy old people and centenarians.	longevity, aging	1993-11-01	The contribution of the immune system to healthy aging and longevity is still an open question. For this reason, several immune parameters (T, B, and natural killer [NK] cell subsets; non-major histocompatibility complex [MHC]-restricted cytotoxic activities, ie, natural and redirected killing [RDK] activities) were studied in a total of 138 healthy subjects of different ages, from 4 to 106 years of age, including 26 centenarians. The major age-related modifications were the following: (1) a decrease in the absolute number of T lymphocytes (CD3+), involving both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, accompanied by a marked concomitant increase in the number of activated T cells (CD3+, HLA-DR+); (2) a marked decrease in the number of B lymphocytes (CD19+); and (3) an increase in the number of cells with markers of NK activity and of T lymphocytes able to mediate non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. These modifications linearly progressed with age and centenarians followed the trend, suggesting that their …
23624491	Age-related differences in memory-encoding fMRI responses after accounting for decline in vascular reactivity.	aging	2013-09-??	BOLD fMRI has provided a wealth of information about the aging brain. A common finding is that posterior regions of the brain manifest an age-related decrease in activation while the anterior regions show an age-related increase. Several neurocognitive models have been proposed to interpret these findings. However, one issue that has not been sufficiently considered to date is that the BOLD signal is based on vascular responses secondary to neural activity. Thus the above findings could be in part due to a vascular change, especially in view of the expected decline of vascular health with age. In the present study, we aim to examine age-related differences in memory-encoding fMRI response in the context of vascular aging. One hundred and thirty healthy subjects ranging from 20 to 89 years old underwent a scene-viewing fMRI task and, in the same session, cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was measured in each subject using a CO2-inhalation task. Without accounting for the influence of vas…
15310734	Zinc supplementation reduces fractional zinc absorption in young and elderly korean women.	aging	2004-08-??	BACKGROUND: Adjustments in zinc losses and absorption are thought to maintain zinc homeostasis with changes in intake, but the capacity to make these adjustments appears to be affected by aging. Zinc status of the individual may also influence adjustments in fractional zinc absorption.    OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of changes in zinc status due to zinc supplementation on fractional zinc absorption in young and elderly Korean women.    DESIGN: Zinc status and absorption were measured initially in 15 young (20-24 yr) and 15 elderly women (64-75 yr) confined to a metabolic unit and consuming a typical Korean diet. Upon discharge from the unit the women were supplemented with 22 mg zinc/d for 28 days. On d 20, the women returned to the unit for measurement of zinc status and absorption. Fractional zinc absorption (FZA) was estimated from the same typical Korean breakfast at both time points using the dual isotopic tracer method. Zinc stable isotopic rat…
8872642	Role of aerobic capacity and body mass index in the age-associated decline in heart rate variability.	aging	1996-08-??	The extent to which age-associated changes in aerobic capacity and body composition modulate the age-associated decline in heart rate variability (HRV) is unknown. We therefore measured HRV, peak O2 consumption (VO2peak) during treadmill testing, and relative weight (body mass index; BMI) in 164 healthy normotensive adults (75 men, age 20-87 yr) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. Two components of HRV, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; 0.12-0.40 Hz) and 0.10-Hz variability (0.06-0.10 Hz), were extracted from 8-min electrocardiogram recordings in the supine, seated, and standing postures. RSA, 0.10-Hz variability, and VO2peak varied inversely with age; BMI was unrelated to age. Age contributed 15.5-21.1% independent variance to RSA and 13.2-17.3% independent variance to 0.10-Hz HRV. VO2peak did not contribute significantly to RSA or 0.10-Hz HRV beyond the effect of age in any posture. There were no consistent independent contributions of BMI to HRV. Thus, in this populatio…
1365846	Homeostasis between lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in healthy human aging.	aging	1992-11-??	In healthy people the plasma malondialdehyde increases with age, however there is a simultaneous rise in the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in red blood cells, although both enzymes show a biphasic behaviour, that is, reaching the lowest values at 40-50 years of age to rise remarkably later on. No significant changes were found in the case of glutathione peroxidase but the age-dependent behaviour is similar to the other enzymes mentioned above. The activity of glutathione reductase shows a clear increase depending on age, up to middle age, with or without flavin adenine dinucleotide. We conclude that the increase in the activities of the anti-oxidant enzymes of the red blood cells during aging, could be interpreted as a positive feedback mechanism in response to rising lipid peroxidation. Consequently, from the point of view of the parameters used the homeostasis between the production of free radicals and anti-oxidant systems seems…
6496592	Cardiorespiratory efficiency at submaximal work in young and middle-aged women.	aging	1984-11-15	Seventeen middle-aged women and 26 younger women were studied while walking at 3 mph and a 5% grade on a motorized treadmill. This was submaximal work for all subjects and is equivalent to the intensity of everyday activity. The middle-aged women had a significantly greater oxygen uptake, ventilatory equivalent, and heart rate, suggesting a relative cardiorespiratory inefficiency at this submaximal work intensity. This phenomenon is most likely a function of body size, however, since dividing the submaximal oxygen uptake by body weight rendered the mean difference between the two groups statistically insignificant. The age-associated reduction in cardiorespiratory efficiency at submaximal exercise is thus due primarily to weight gain rather than to actual systems degeneration. Maximal oxygen uptake, that associated with maximal physical effort, was significantly reduced in the older subjects, and this is probably due to a combination of previous life-style habits and aging.
8340244	P300 component of the event-related potentials (ERP) during an attention task: effects of age, stimulus modality and event probability.	aging	1993-05-??	The effects of age, stimulus modality and event probability on event-related potentials (ERP) were studied in 12 young and 12 elderly healthy subjects. The ERP were recorded from 15 electrodes referred to linked ears. Results showed that both amplitude and latency of the P300 component are affected by aging. Study of the latency of the earlier ERP components in the two age groups revealed that the P300 delay was not imputable to a delay of the earlier components. P300 amplitude and latency were also affected by event probability and stimulus modality: infrequent stimulus involved higher and later P300, but this effect was more pronounced in the young than in the old group; higher and later P300 were also recorded during the visual task compared to the auditory. Topographical repartition of the brain wave revealed a predominance of the central sites (Fz, Cz, Pz). The findings are discussed in relation to the sensitivity of the ERP assessment procedures in age related modifications of in…
10911945	Mitochondrial oxidative stress and aging in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina.	aging	2000-06-??	In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, mitochondrial oxidative stress is a major contributor to aging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated as a result of electron leakage during respiration lead to damage of components of the electron transport chain. In aging wild-type cultures, damaged proteins cannot be replaced because the mitochondrial genes encoding some of the corresponding subunits gradually become deleted from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Consequently, these defects result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species and respiration deficits leading to cell death. Analyses of wild-type strains and of different long-lived mutants of P. anserina provide strong evidence that molecular mechanisms controlling aging processes in this fungus are complex and act at different levels. A basic mechanism (e.g., damage by ROS) appears to be overlaid by prominent instabilities of the mtDNA.
23603446	Training-induced cerebral changes in the elderly.	aging	2014-??-??	As the demographic shift towards an aging population prevails, the improvement and/or maintenance of cognitive functioning appear increasingly important. To date, the effectiveness of cognitive, cardiovascular and sensorimotor training approaches in older adults has been demonstrated frequently using neuropsychological and behavioral performance measures. We present an overview of selected studies applying modern imaging techniques (fMRI, PET) to assess practice-induced structural and functional changes in the brain. Structurally, practice is associated with volumetric increases. Functionally, reorganization of neural network recruitment, overall decreases and increases in activity levels are found. Thus, the human brain retains a high degree of plasticity in old age. Moreover, it seems that practice leads to more efficient processing, requiring less neural engagement to perform the same task. While the concept of economization finds widespread support in healthy populations, in patien…
2536646	Calpain II in human lens.	aging	1989-02-??	The purposes of the current study were to: determine if human lenses contain calpain II (EC.34.22.17) activity, measure the effect of aging and anatomical location on lens calpain II activity, and determine if human lenses contain the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. Both enzymatic and immunologic assays indicated that human lenses contained calpain II activity. Calpain II activity was highest in the cortex of lenses from young donors, and lowest in the nucleus of aged lenses, where it was sometimes nondetectable. In some cases, calpain II activity persisted in the nucleus of lenses from donors greater than 70 years of age. Human lenses also contained endogenous calpain inhibitor (calpastatin) in excess over calpain enzymatic activity. Calpastatin activity did not decrease during aging. Although human lenses contained approximately 3% of the calpain activity found in rat lenses, calpain II may still be a major endopeptidase in human lenses. Demonstration of calpain II in human…
2721973	Heart rate and blood pressure reactivity during active coping with a mental task in healthy 18- to 73-year-old subjects.	aging	1989-??-??	Alterations with aging in the responses of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) reactivity were investigated during mild mental stress induced by undergoing a psychometric test, in 52 women and men aged 18-73 years, with no history of cardiovascular, renal or neurological deficits. HR and BP responses were measured before, during and after the test. Resting HR and diastolic BP (DBP) were not age-related while resting systolic BP (SBP) was. HR and SBP were increased during test performance. HR reactivity, measured during task execution as well as during recovery, was significantly decreased in older subjects. DBP recovery variation was lowered with age. These results indicate that age is an important determinant of the magnitude of cardiovascular adjustment during minor mental stress in women and men.
23597737	Estimation of age using aspartic acid racemisation in human dentin in Indian population.	aging	2013-05-10	AIM: The quest to identify an accurate method of age estimation, had lead to the evaluation of aspartic acid racemisation in hard tissues of the human remains using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Our study is aimed at the applicability of the racemisation technique to use dentin as the sample to estimate the age in South Indian sub-population.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six non-carious teeth from living individuals distributed among 6 age groups (6 each), sexes (18 each) and jaws (18 each) were analysed for dextro (d) and levo (l) forms of aspartic acid using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique and their racemisation ratio were calculated for each tooth sample.    RESULTS: High correlation was obtained between the aspartic acid racemisation rates in dentin and age of the individual with an error limited to ±3 years. Racemisation rates in teeth did not significantly differ between the sexes or jaws.    CONCLUSION: The d-aspartic acid accumulatio…
9374744	Age effects on interrelationships between lung volume and heart rate during standing.	aging	1997-??-??	To determine the effects of aging and posture on the relationship between respiration and heart rate (HR), we collected 5 min of lung volume and R-R interval data from 7 young (27 +/- 3 yr, mean +/- SD) and 10 old (69 +/- 6 yr) healthy humans during spontaneous breathing while they were supine (SU) and standing (ST). Lung volume and HR power spectra and transfer functions between lung volume and HR were estimated. Age and position effects and age-position interactions were determined by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Older subjects had a lower and more variable respiration rate (P < 0.03, P < 0.04), but both age groups exhibited decreased rate of respiration and increased tidal volume with ST (P < 0.05, P < 0.005). ST decreased lung volume-to-HR transfer function magnitude in both groups (P < 0.07). The more marked age-related differences were in phase angle. Both SU and ST phase angles were greater in older subjects (P < 0.003). ST decreased phase angle in young but incre…
1825740	Effects of aging on left ventricular structure and function.	aging	1991-03-??	To better characterize the cardiac structural and functional changes that are associated with aging, Doppler-echocardiography was performed on 23 young (mean age, 25 years) and 30 old (mean age, 70 years) healthy normotensive subjects. Left ventricular cavity dimensions and wall thickness were determined and left ventricular mass index was calculated from M-mode echocardiograms. Stroke volume was calculated from Doppler-measured aortic flow. Diastolic filling was evaluated by pulsed Doppler echocardiography of mitral inflow. Posterior wall thickness (1.0 vs 0.8 cm, p less than 0.05) and relative wall thickness (0.42 vs 0.35, p less than .05) were significantly greater in the elderly subjects compared with the younger subjects. Left ventricular mass index increased on average 0.25 gm/m2/yr but was not significantly increased in the elderly compared with the younger subjects (89 vs 77 gm/m2). Shortening fraction and stroke volume did not differ between the two groups. Diastolic filling w…
3589328	Effect of aging on sleep-related changes in respiratory variables.	aging	1987-04-??	Several respiratory variables were examined in 11 healthy elderly (greater than 60 years) and 12 younger (30-39 years) control subjects during all-night sleep runs, with a view to determining the effect of the aging process on breathing during sleep. O2 saturation, end-tidal PCO2, and transcutaneous PCO2 were monitored, together with standard sleep staging measures. Estimates of tidal volume (Vt) and ventilation (Ve) were obtained using a Respitrace inductive plethysmography system, from which respiratory rate (fb) was also measured. Older subjects had more sleep apnea/hypopnea than younger subjects, an incidence of 55 versus 8%, respectively. More of their arousals were associated with respiratory disturbance than those of the younger subjects, and they had more brief, but not longer, arousals. Mean O2 saturation was lower in older subjects during wakefulness but did not decrease more in older subjects than in control subjects during sleep. Mean end-tidal/transcutaneous PCO2 did not d…
24132650	Epigenetics components of aging in the central nervous system.	aging	2013-10-??	This review highlights recent discoveries that have shaped the emerging viewpoints in the field of epigenetic influences in the central nervous system (CNS), focusing on the following questions: (i) How is the CNS shaped during development when precursor cells transition into morphologically and molecularly distinct cell types, and is this event driven by epigenetic alterations?; ii) How do epigenetic pathways control CNS function?; (iii) What happens to "epigenetic memory" during aging processes, and do these alterations cause CNS dysfunction?; (iv) Can one restore normal CNS function by manipulating the epigenome using pharmacologic agents, and will this ameliorate aging-related neurodegeneration? These and other still unanswered questions remain critical to understanding the impact of multifaceted epigenetic machinery on the age-related dysfunction of CNS.
21536055	Age-related changes in brain activation underlying single- and dual-task performance: visuomanual drawing and mental arithmetic.	aging	2011-07-??	Depending on task combination, dual-tasking can either be performed successfully or can lead to performance decrements in one or both tasks. Interference is believed to be caused by limitations in central processing, i.e. structural interference between the neural activation patterns associated with each task. In the present study, single- and dual-task effects were addressed in the context of aging. Increasing evidence from research on motor and cognitive tasks has shown that aging is associated with an expansion of brain activation and an increased BOLD-signal. This may result in increased structural interference and higher dual-task interference in older adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the BOLD-response in 20 old and 20 young healthy adults while performing tasks separately, or combined. Single tasks consisted of mental arithmetic cued by auditory tones, and a visuomotor task, drawing a circular shape with spatiotemporal constraints. Age-related bra…
28624521	Semanticized autobiographical memory and the default - executive coupling hypothesis of aging.	aging	2018-??-??	As we age, the architecture of cognition undergoes a fundamental transition. Fluid intellectual abilities decline while crystalized abilities remain stable or increase. This shift has a profound impact across myriad cognitive and functional domains, yet the neural mechanisms remain under-specified. We have proposed that greater connectivity between the default network and executive control regions in lateral prefrontal cortex may underlie this shift, as older adults increasingly rely upon accumulated knowledge to support goal-directed behavior. Here we provide direct evidence for this mechanism within the domain of autobiographical memory. In a large sample of healthy adult participants (n = 103 Young; n = 80 Old) the strength of default - executive coupling reliably predicted more semanticized, or knowledge-based, recollection of autobiographical memories in the older adult cohort. The findings are consistent with the default - executive coupling hypothesis of aging and identify this …

26208709	Movement sequencing in normal aging: speech, oro-facial, and finger movements.	aging	2015-08-??	The manner and extent to which normal aging affects the ability to speak are not fully understood. While age-related changes in voice fundamental frequency and intensity have been documented, changes affecting the planning and articulation of speech are less well understood. In the present study, 76 healthy, cognitively normal participants aged between 18 and 93 years old were asked to produce auditorily and visually triggered sequences of finely controlled movements (speech, oro-facial, and manual movement). These sequences of movements were either (1) simple, in which at least two of the three movements were the same, or (2) complex, in which three different movements were produced. For each of the resulting experimental condition, accuracy was calculated. The results show that, for speech and oro-facial movements, accuracy declined as a function of age and complexity. For these movements, the negative effect of complexity on performance accuracy increased with age. No aging or compl…
12200038	The variability of the mitochondrial genome in human aging: a key for life and death?	aging	2002-11-??	The impressive performance of the research in mitochondrial genetics and human aging in the last decade outlines a new scenery in which the inherited variation of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) may play a role in rate and quality of aging. This variation in humans was initially looked at as nearly neutral, and useful just for the reconstruction of human population history. However, recent data suggest that different mtDNA molecules are qualitatively different from each other. The aim of this paper is to discuss current ideas on the relationships among mitochondrial function, mtDNA inherited variation, and aging. The main processes where the mitochondrion is involved and the importance these processes have on aging and death of individuals will be described. A possible connection between programmed death phenomena (mitoptosis, apoptosis, phenoptosis) and rate and quality of aging will be discussed. Finally, the possible role played in these processes by the mtDNA germline variation wi…
22694275	Everyday memory errors in older adults.	aging	2013-??-??	Despite concern about cognitive decline in old age, few studies document the types and frequency of memory errors older adults make in everyday life. In the present study, 105 healthy older adults completed the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ; Sunderland, Harris, & Baddeley, 1983 , Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, 341), indicating what memory errors they had experienced in the last 24 hours, the Memory Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (MSEQ; West, Thorn, & Bagwell, 2003 , Psychology and Aging, 18, 111), and other neuropsychological and cognitive tasks. EMQ and MSEQ scores were unrelated and made separate contributions to variance on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975 , Journal of Psychiatric Research, 12, 189), suggesting separate constructs. Tip-of-the-tongue errors were the most commonly reported, and the EMQ Faces/Places and New Things subscales were most strongly related to MMSE. These findings may help training programs target mem…
30633320	NKT-like cells reveal higher than T lymphocytes expression of cellular protective proteins HSP70 and SOD2 and comparably increased expression of SIRT1 in the oldest seniors.	longevity	2018-??-??	INTRODUCTION: NKT-like cells are "non-classical", "CD1d-independent" NKT cells which represent highly differentiated, conventional T lymphocytes coexpressing several NK (natural killer) associated receptors. They are effector lymphocytes of both innate and adaptive immunity and simultaneously regulatory cells of the adaptive immune system. They reveal large granular lymphocyte morphology and can mediate both MHC-restricted and MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, secrete many cytokines and modulate Th1 immune responses. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of proteins involved in cellular stress response: sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in NKT-like cells compared to T lymphocytes during ageing.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved three groups of participants: the oldest seniors (n = 25; aged over 85; mean age 88 ± 0.5 ys), the old (n = 30; aged under 85; mean age 76 ± 0.9 ys) and the young (n = 32; mean age 21 ±…
16608398	Mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence: cause or consequence?	aging	2006-??-??	The mitochondrial theory of aging remains to date one of the most popular theories of aging. One major model of aging is replicative senescence, where the irreversible loss of division potential of somatic cells occurs after a more or less constant number of cell divisions. Few data are available concerning the role of mitochondria in this model. Here, we review evidence supporting the involvement of mitochondria in replicative senescence and a possible link to telomere biology. Moreover, we suggest that this process might be more complex than originally formulated, because variations in nuclear gene expression involved in mitochondrion nucleus cross-talk are observed in both senescence and immortalization.
13793371	Average potassium concentration of the human body as a function of age.	aging	1959-09-18	Potassium-40 measurements on 1590 males and females ranging in age from less than 1 year to 79 years show sex differences and age trends in the ratio of muscle mass to the mass of other body constituents. A difference first at approximately 12 years of age. While females show a continuous decrease in potassium concentration, males show a rapid increase between the ages of 14 and 16. During adult life both sexes show a persistent and parallel decrease, which may be related to physiologic aging.
27479009	The Effect of Aging on Relationships between Lean Body Mass and VO2max in Rowers.	aging	2016-??-??	Aging is associated with a fall in maximal aerobic capacity as well as with a decline in lean body mass. The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of aging on the relationship between aerobic capacity and lean body mass in subjects that chronically train both their upper and lower bodies. Eleven older rowers (58±5 yrs) and 11 younger rowers (27±4 yrs) participated in the study. Prior to the VO2max testing, subjects underwent a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan to estimate total lean body mass. Subsequently, VO2max was quantified during a maximal exercise test on a rowing ergometer as well as a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer. The test protocol included a pre-exercise stage followed by incremental exercise until VO2max was reached. The order of exercise modes was randomized and there was a wash-out period between the two tests. Oxygen uptake was obtained via a breath-by-breath metabolic cart (Vmax™ Encore, San Diego, CA). Rowing VO2max was higher than cycling VO2max i…
24162336	An elevation of resting metabolic rate with declining health in nonagenarians may be associated with decreased muscle mass and function in women and men, respectively.	aging	2014-06-??	Previously, we showed that FI34, a frailty index based on 34 health and function ability variables, is heritable and a reliable phenotypic indicator of healthy aging. We have now examined the relationship between major components of energy expenditure and the FI34 in participants of the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study. Resting metabolic rate was associated with FI34, even after adjustment for fat-free mass, fat mass, age, sex, thyroid hormones, and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, in multiple regression analyses. In contrast, there was no association between total daily energy expenditure and FI34. Circulating creatine phosphokinase, a clinical marker of muscle damage, was also significantly associated with FI34. However, these associations of resting metabolic rate with FI34 were restricted to the oldest old (≥90 years) and absent in younger age groups. In oldest old men, the association of FI34 with creatine phosphokinase persisted, whereas in the oldest old women, only the associa…
12915209	Experimental evidence against the mitochondrial theory of aging. A study of isolated human skeletal muscle mitochondria.	aging	2003-08-??	The mitochondrial theory of aging was tested with optimised preparation techniques. Mitochondria were isolated from approximately 90 mg quadriceps muscle from healthy humans at age 70+ and 20+. The content of mitochondrial protein was approximately 10 mg g(-1) muscle and the yields were approximately 40%. The mitochondrial integrity was high as judged from the respiratory control and P/O ratios. No general membrane alterations or changes in the cytochrome contents were observed. BSA decreased the non-phosphorylating rates of respiration equally in both age groups. Thirteen different enzyme activities were assayed and normalised to protein content and citrate synthase activity. Most of the critical levels for detection of declines were <10%. In the 70+ group, the activity for fatty acid oxidation was decreased by approximately 20%. Two inherently low activities associated with oxidation of sarcoplasmic NADH were also decreased, probably related to the age change of fibre types. The rema…
17204820	Age effects on the neural correlates of episodic retrieval: increased cortical recruitment with matched performance.	aging	2007-11-??	Functional neuroimaging investigations have revealed a range of age-related differences in the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval. Typically, whereas activity is reduced in older compared with younger adults in some regions, other regions are engaged exclusively, or to a greater extent, in older adults. It is unclear whether such differences merely represent the neural correlates of the lower levels of memory performance and impaired recollection typical of older adults. This issue was addressed in the present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The level of recollection was matched between groups of healthy younger and older adults for a subset of picture items in a source memory task by manipulating the number of study presentations. Contrasts of the activity elicited by old items attracting correct source judgments and correctly identified new items revealed that the 2 groups recruited many of the same brain regions. However, a striking pattern of …
26971801	Comparison of bioenergetics of walking during a multistage incremental shuttle walk test and a 6-min walk test in active older adults.	aging	2017-04-??	The goal of the present research was to compare the bioenergetics variability of walking, during the 6-min walk test (6-MWT) and a multistage incremental shuttle walk test (MISWT) in an active older population. Twenty-two healthy physically active older adults with a group mean age of 70.4 ± 5.8 years completed the 6-MWT and the MISWT. Heart rate (HR), walking speed and walking [Formula: see text]O were measured throughout each test with a portable metabolic cart. Strong correlations were found for the [Formula: see text]O peak and the walking speed (r = 0.91 and r = 0.89 respectively for 6-MWT and MISWT). Differences in [Formula: see text]O peak values were analysed with a paired Student's t test. Repeated measures ANOVA were conducted to detect differences between tests. The Bland and Altman plot indicates that the average difference between both tests was 2.5 ml kg min. MISWT [Formula: see text]O peak means were significantly greater than the 6-MWT [Formula: see text]O peak mean val…
21173032	Age-dependent gain of alternative splice forms and biased duplication explain the relation between splicing and duplication.	aging	2011-03-??	We analyze here the relation between alternative splicing and gene duplication in light of recent genomic data, with a focus on the human genome. We show that the previously reported negative correlation between level of alternative splicing and family size no longer holds true. We clarify this pattern and show that it is sufficiently explained by two factors. First, genes progressively gain new splice variants with time. The gain is consistent with a selectively relaxed regime, until purifying selection slows it down as aging genes accumulate a large number of variants. Second, we show that duplication does not lead to a loss of splice forms, but rather that genes with low levels of alternative splicing tend to duplicate more frequently. This leads us to reconsider the role of alternative splicing in duplicate retention.
28554736	Heat transfer and loss by whole-body hyperthermia during severe lower-body heating are impaired in healthy older men.	aging	2017-??-01	Most studies demonstrate that aging is associated with a weakened thermoregulation. However, it remains unclear whether heat transfer (for heat loss) from the lower (uncompensable) to the upper (compensable) body during passively-induced severe lower-body heating is delayed or attenuated with aging. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate heat transfer from uncompensable to compensable body areas in young men and healthy older men during passively-induced whole-body hyperthermia with a demonstrated post-heating change in core body (rectal; T) temperature. Nine healthy older men and eleven healthy young men (69±6 vs. 21±1 years old, mean±SD, P<0.05) participated in passively-induced severe lower-body heating in water at approximately 43°C. Despite a similar increment in T (approximately 2.5°C) in both groups, the heating rate was significantly lower in older men than in young men (1.69±0.12 vs. 2.47±0.29°C/h, respectively; P<0.05). The temperature increase in calf m…
16518718	Genotype profiles of loci encoding DNA repair enzymes in newborn and elderly populations: no evidence of association with longevity.	longevity	2006-02-??	The comparison of genotype frequencies between neonates and elderly populations can aid in the identification of loci, and polymorphisms within those loci, that affect longevity. Here we have compared genotype frequencies of seven polymorphisms at four loci involved in DNA repair between a cohort of newborns (n = 290) and a retired population (average age at sampling 70.02 years; n = 430) who have suffered a lifetime of DNA damage from normal, metabolic processes, and on whom selection on DNA repair gene variants may be expected to have acted. No differences in genotype frequencies at the four SNP loci were seen, indicating that there is no evidence of association with longevity in this population. Significant differences in frequency of certain repeat sizes at three microsatellite loci were detected. However, since there is no known functional consequence of these repeat lengths, the action of selection cannot yet be ascribed.
25093459	Selective control of attention supports the positivity effect in aging.	aging	2014-??-??	There is emerging evidence for a positivity effect in healthy aging, which describes an age-specific increased focus on positive compared to negative information. Life-span researchers have attributed this effect to the selective allocation of cognitive resources in the service of prioritized emotional goals. We explored the basic principles of this assumption by assessing selective attention and memory for visual stimuli, differing in emotional content and self-relevance, in young and old participants. To specifically address the impact of cognitive control, voluntary attentional selection during the presentation of multiple-item displays was analyzed and linked to participants' general ability of cognitive control. Results revealed a positivity effect in older adults' selective attention and memory, which was particularly pronounced for self-relevant stimuli. Focusing on positive and ignoring negative information was most evident in older participants with a generally higher ability …
24799450	Mitochondria hyperfusion and elevated autophagic activity are key mechanisms for cellular bioenergetic preservation in centenarians.	longevity, aging	2014-04-??	Mitochondria have been considered for long time as important determinants of cell aging because of their role in the production of reactive oxygen species. In this study we investigated the impact of mitochondrial metabolism and biology as determinants of successful aging in primary cultures of fibroblasts isolated from the skin of long living individuals (LLI) (about 100 years old) compared with those from young (about 27 years old) and old (about 75 years old) subjects. We observed that fibroblasts from LLI displayed significantly lower complex I-driven ATP synthesis and higher production of H2O2 in comparison with old subjects. Despite these changes, bioenergetics of these cells appeared to operate normally. This lack of functional consequences was likely due to a compensatory phenomenon at the level of mitochondria, which displayed a maintained supercomplexes organization and an increased mass. This appears to be due to a decreased mitophagy, induced by hyperfused, elongated mitoch…
15386247	Lack of age-related increase in average glycemia in a non-Westernized sample of rural Yucatec Maya females.	aging	2005-01-??	Age-related decline in glucose processing and the associated progressively higher circulating glucose levels are considered well-established biological aging phenomena. However, their occurrence in non-Westernized populations characterized by less mechanization and dietary processing has not been well-studied. This research extends evaluation of lifestyle conditions of diet and physical activity beyond those of Westernized areas and examines aging patterns in blood glucose among rural Yucatec Maya. The purpose is to investigate whether deteriorating glucose processing is intrinsic to human aging, while controlling for body composition in a non-Westernized setting. Data were gathered from 60 nondiabetic Maya women, 40-85 years of age, living in 16 rural villages around Merida, Yucatan. Information regarding personal history, diet, and physical activity was collected through interviews. Body composition was assessed through anthropometric and derived indicators of body size, fat distribu…
29929161	Do spatiotemporal parameters and gait variability differ across the lifespan of healthy adults? A systematic review.	aging	2018-07-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is often associated with changes in the musculoskeletal system, peripheral and central nervous system. These age-related changes often result in mobility problems influencing gait performance. Compensatory strategies are used as a way to adapt to these physiological changes.    RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this review is to investigate the differences in spatiotemporal and gait variability measures throughout the healthy adult life.    METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database (no. CRD42017057720). Databases MEDLINE (Pubmed), Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect were systematically searched until March 2018.    RESULTS: Eighteen of the 3195 original studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The majority of studies reported spatiotemporal and gait variability measures in adults above the age of 65, followed by the young adult pop…
23537202	Resveratrol up-regulates the erythrocyte plasma membrane redox system and mitigates oxidation-induced alterations in erythrocytes during aging in humans.	aging	2013-06-??	Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)-mediated oxidative damage followed by disturbed cellular homeostasis is involved in aging and related consequences. Lipid peroxidation, post-translational modifications of proteins, and an impaired defense system due to increased oxidative stress jeopardize cell fate and functions, resulting in cell senescence. Resveratrol, a natural stilbene, has extensively been reported to elicit a plethora of health-promoting effects. The present study carried out on 97 healthy human subjects (62 males and 35 females) of both sexes provides experimental evidence that resveratrol confers ability to up-regulate the plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) along with ascorbate free radical reductase, a compensatory system operating in the cell to maintain cellular redox state. Furthermore, resveratrol provided significant protection against lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation and restored the cellular redox homeostasis measured in terms of glutathione (GS…
1800131	Applications of chaos theory to the molecular biology of aging.	aging	1991-??-??	New developments in the field of chaos theory can help us describe in detail many hitherto unexplained natural phenomena. Some of the developments of this theory can be applied to molecular gerontology to complement existing techniques used in this field. Thus, there is the potential of better description, quantification, and manipulation of some aging mechanisms.
23325713	Age attenuates leucine oxidation after eccentric exercise.	aging	2013-08-??	Aging may alter protein metabolism during periods of metabolic and physiologic challenge. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age on whole-body amino acid turnover in response to eccentric exercise and hyperglycemia-induced hyperinsulinemia. 16 healthy men were divided into young (N=8) and older (N=8) groups. Protein metabolism was assessed using a [1-13C]-leucine isotopic tracer approach. Measures were obtained under fasted basal conditions and during 3-h hyperglycemic clamps that were performed without (control) and 48 h after eccentric exercise. Exercise reduced leucine oxidation in the younger men (P<0.05), but not in older men. Insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with leucine oxidation (P<0.05), and was lower in older men (P<0.05). Healthy aging is associated with an impaired capacity to adjust protein oxidation in response to eccentric exercise. The decreased efficiency of protein utilization in older men may contribute to impaired maintenance, growth,…
2299344	Lipid compositions of different regions of the human brain during aging.	aging	1990-02-??	The neutral and phospholipid compositions of various regions of the human brain were analyzed using autopsy material covering the life period between 33 and 92 years of age. The protein content was also measured and, on a weight basis, this content is unchanged in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in the 90-year-old group it decreases in the hippocampus, gray matter, and nucleus caudatus. In white matter, the protein content decreases continuously with age. The phospholipid composition is characteristic of the region investigated, but remains unchanged during aging. The total phospholipid content exhibits only a 5-10% decrease in the oldest age group. The content of dolichol and its polyisoprenoid pattern are also characteristic of the region analyzed. Between 33 and 92 years of age, the amount of dolichol in all portions of the brain increases three- to fourfold, but the isoprenoid pattern remains constant. The level of dolichyl-P varies between different regions, b…
17478011	Enhanced and bilateralized visual sensory processing in the ventral stream may be a feature of normal aging.	aging	2008-10-??	Evidence has emerged for age-related amplification of basic sensory processing indexed by early components of the visual evoked potential (VEP). However, since these age-related effects have been incidental to the main focus of these studies, it is unclear whether they are performance dependent or alternately, represent intrinsic sensory processing changes. High-density VEPs were acquired from 19 healthy elderly and 15 young control participants who viewed alphanumeric stimuli in the absence of any active task. The data show both enhanced and delayed neural responses within structures of the ventral visual stream, with reduced hemispheric asymmetry in the elderly that may be indicative of a decline in hemispheric specialization. Additionally, considerably enhanced early frontal cortical activation was observed in the elderly, suggesting frontal hyper-activation. These age-related differences in early sensory processing are discussed in terms of recent proposals that normal aging involv…
19004526	Age-related changes in neural activity associated with familiarity, recollection and false recognition.	aging	2010-10-??	Older adults often exhibit elevated false recognition for events that never occurred, while simultaneously experiencing difficulty in recognizing events that actually occurred. It has been proposed that reduced recollection in conjunction with an over-reliance on familiarity may contribute to this pattern of results. This explanation is somewhat inconsistent, however, with recent evidence suggesting that familiarity and associated neural activity are reduced in healthy aging. Alternatively, given that illusory memory may be based, in part, on veridical memory processes (recollection/familiarity), one might predict that older adults exhibit enhanced false alarm rates because the neural signatures associated with true recognition (hits) and false recognition (false alarms) are less distinguishable in old than in young adults. Here, we used event-related fMRI to measure the effects of aging on neural activity associated with recollection, familiarity and familiarity-based false alarms for…
27835771	Self-perception of uselessness and mortality among older adults in China.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Negative self-perceptions of aging among older adults have been associated with higher mortality in developed countries. However, it is unclear whether an association exists in developing countries where living to older age is more selective.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Using five waves of data (2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011) from a national survey of adults aged 65 and older in China (n=30,948), this study investigates how self-perceived feelings of uselessness are associated with subsequent mortality. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group (65-79, 80-89, 90-99, and 100+), and adjusted for a wide range of covariates.    RESULTS: Compared with women who never reported perceived uselessness, results from adjusted models shows that women who always reported perceived uselessness had 42% (p<0.001), 31% (p<0.001), and 24% (p<0.001) higher risks of mortality in each of the three oldest age groups, respectively. These associations were only slightly attenuated when covariate…
18236464	Skeletal muscle telomere length is not impaired in healthy physically active old women and men.	aging	2008-04-??	We have previously shown that the number of satellite cells is lower in old than young men and women. The aim of this study was to further explore the effects of aging on the regenerative potential of skeletal muscle in 16 young and 26 old men and women with comparable physical activity level (young, 25 +/- 4 years; old, 75 +/- 4 years). Mean and minimum telomere lengths were determined using Southern blot analyses on biopsies obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle. There were no significant age or gender effects on mean and minimal telomeric lengths, suggesting that the replicative potential in the remaining satellite cells in the tibialis anterior muscle is not impaired with increasing age and the existence of in vivo regulatory mechanisms allowing the maintenance of telomere length. These results imply that moderate physical activity regularly performed by old subjects is not associated with accelerated telomere loss.
28470125	Aging, exceptional longevity and comparisons of the Hannum and Horvath epigenetic clocks.	longevity, aging	2017-??-??	AIM: To examine the relationships between two epigenetic clocks, aging and exceptional longevity.    MATERIALS & METHODS: Participants were from three adult cohorts with blood DNA methylation data (Illumina 450 K, n = 275, 34-103 years). Epigenetic age (DNAmage) and age acceleration measures were calculated using the Hannum and Horvath epigenetic clocks.    RESULTS: Across all cohorts, DNAmage was correlated with chronological age. In the long-lived cohort (Sydney Centenarian Study; 95+, n = 23), DNAmage was lower than chronological age for both clocks. Mean Sydney Centenarian Study Hannum age acceleration was negative, while the converse was observed for the Horvath model.    CONCLUSION: Long-lived individuals have a young epigenetic age compared with their chronological age.
10084562	Independent influence of age on basal insulin secretion in nondiabetic humans. European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance.	aging	1999-03-??	Glucose tolerance deteriorates with aging. To test whether age per se impairs basal beta-cell function, we analyzed retrospective clamp data from a large group (n = 957) of nondiabetic Europeans over the 18-85 yr age range (the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance database). In this cohort, the fasting posthepatic insulin delivery rate [IDR, obtained as the product of clamp-derived posthepatic insulin MCR and fasting plasma insulin concentration] was 8.9 (6.6) mU/min (median and interquartile range), and it gradually increased with age. In univariate association, IDR was positively related to body mass index (P < 0.0001), fasting plasma glucose (P < 0.01), and waist-to-hip ratio (P < 0.001), and negatively related to insulin sensitivity (P < 0.0001). After controlling for these factors in a multivariate model, IDR declined significantly with age (P < 0.0001). This intrinsic effect of age on IDR was similar in men and women, and it averaged 25% between 18-85 yr. In the sam…
9661593	Relationship of serum sex steroid levels and bone turnover markers with bone mineral density in men and women: a key role for bioavailable estrogen.	aging	1998-07-??	Estrogen (E) deficiency associated with the menopause is the major cause of bone loss in aging women. However, men also lose significant amounts of bone with age, but they do not have the equivalent of menopause, and serum total testosterone (T) and E levels decline only marginally with age in men. Thus, it has been difficult to attribute bone loss in aging men to either T or E deficiency. Here, we show in a population-based, age-stratified sample of 346 men, aged 23-90 yr, that serum total T and E (estradiol plus estrone) levels decreased over the life span by 30% and 12%, respectively, but bioavailable (or nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound) T and E levels decreased by 64% and 47%, respectively. In these men and in a parallel cohort of 304 women, aged 21-94 yr, serum PTH increased 84% and 64% over the life span, and urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) excretion, a bone resorption marker, increased 77% and 80% between age 50-85 yr in the men and women, respectively. By u…
11835271	Age-related changes in the glutathione redox system.	aging	2002-03-??	The effect of aging on the glutathione redox system was evaluated in this study. For this purpose, we determined reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in whole blood, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GSSGR) in erythrocytes and selenium (Se) in plasma in 176 healthy individuals. We also calculated GSH/GSSG molar ratios. These subjects were divided into five groups: group 1 (n=25; 0.2-1 years old); group 2 (n=28; 2-11 years old); group 3 (n=23; 12-24 years old); group 4 (n=40; 25-40 years old); group 5 (n=60; 41-69 years old). GSH levels in groups 1 and 5 were significantly lower than the other groups (p<0.001). Conversely, GSSG levels were significantly high in these periods (p<0.001). The GSH/GSSG molar ratio was found to be low both in the first year of life and in the oldest group (p<0.001, respectively). GPx activity in group 5 was increased as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). GSSGR activity was significantly lower in the oldest grou…
19023721	The adaptive and maladaptive faces of dependency in later life: links to physical and psychological health outcomes.	aging	2008-11-??	OBJECTIVES: Negotiating the balance between reliance on others and desires for autonomy is a fundamental task of successful aging. The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend a three-factor model of interpersonal dependency in a sample of older adults, and to examine the physical and psychological health correlates of this multifaceted construct.    METHODS: Data come from the third wave of a population-based study of older Americans (n = 166; mean age 80 years). We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of selected dependency items from two scales, and then conducted logistic and hierarchical linear regressions to analyze the association of dependency factors with self-reported health, use of hypertension medication, depressed affect and positive affect.    RESULTS: We found three factors closely paralleling those of Bornstein and Languirand's (Psychological Bulletin, 112(1), 3-23, 2004) measure: destructive overdependence, healthy dependency and dysfunctional detac…
10843353	Effects of aging on cardiovascular responses to gravity-related fluid shift in humans.	aging	2000-06-??	BACKGROUND: Fluid shift induced by postural change causes autonomic neural responses of the cardiovascular system that buffer blood pressure fluctuation. The aim of the study was to clarify the effects of aging on cardiovascular autonomic functions in response to gravity-related fluid shift that unloads or loads the baroreceptors in human subjects.    METHODS: A chest electrocardiogram, blood pressure by Finapres, and stroke volume by impedance method were measured in healthy young men (23-31 years old) and healthy elderly men (74-80 years old) during supine rest, at 90 degrees head-up tilt and thermoneutral head-out water immersion. Spectral analysis was applied to the time series data of the R-R intervals (heart rate variability [HRV]) and systolic blood pressure (blood pressure variability [BPV]). The arterial baroreflex gain for heart rate was estimated using frequency transfer function analysis.    RESULTS: The young subjects had stable blood pressure, despite the larger amount of…
25284304	Age trajectories of functional activation under conditions of low and high processing demands: an adult lifespan fMRI study of the aging brain.	lifespan, aging	2015-01-01	We examined functional activation across the adult lifespan in 316 healthy adults aged 20-89years on a judgment task that, across conditions, drew upon both semantic knowledge and ability to modulate neural function in response to cognitive challenge. Activation in core regions of the canonical semantic network (e.g., left IFG) were largely age-invariant, consistent with cognitive aging studies that show verbal knowledge is preserved across the lifespan. However, we observed a steady linear increase in activation with age in regions outside the core network, possibly as compensation to maintain function. Under conditions of increased task demands, we observed a stepwise reduction across the lifespan of modulation of activation to increasing task demands in cognitive control regions (frontal, parietal, anterior cingulate), paralleling the neural equivalent of "processing resources" described by cognitive aging theories. Middle-age was characterized by decreased modulation to task-demand…
25843236	Activation-induced and damage-induced cell death in aging human T cells.	aging	2015-11-??	In multicellular organisms the proper system functionality is ensured by the balance between cell division, differentiation, senescence and death. This balance is changed during aging. Immunosenescence plays a crucial role in aging and leads to the shrinkage of T cell repertoire and the propensity to apoptosis. The elimination of expanded T cells at the end of immune response is crucial to maintain homeostasis and avoid any uncontrolled inflammation. Resting mature T lymphocytes, when activated via their antigen-specific receptor (TCR) and CD28 co-receptor, start to proliferate and then undergo the so called activation induced cell death (AICD), which mechanistically is triggered by the death receptor and leads to apoptosis. T lymphocytes, like other cells, are also exposed to damage, which can trigger the so called damage-induced cell death (DICD). It was hypothesized that oxidative stress and chronic antigenic load increasing with age reduced lymphocyte susceptibility to DICD and enh…
9520913	The effect of adenosine on the reduced heart rate response to exercise in the elderly.	aging	1998-03-??	BACKGROUND: In a previous study we demonstrated that excessive endogenous adenosine production and/or response was responsible for the blunted tachycardia to bolus intravenous doses of isoproterenol in the elderly. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that excessive endogenous adenosine may also be responsible for the diminished maximal tachycardia with aging.    METHODS: Twelve young (mean age 27.3 +/- .61 yr) and 12 older (mean age 66.8 +/- .9 yr) healthy men were asked to perform maximum exercise tests in the presence of placebo or theophylline at plasma concentrations between 15-20 micrograms/ml. Heart rate, oxygen consumption, and respiratory gas exchange ratio were continuously monitored and recorded during the exercise. In addition, plasma lactate, glycerol, renin activity, and catecholamines were measured before and after maximal exercise.    RESULTS: Maximum heart rate to exercise was higher in the young (190 +/- 3 bpm in the young, 157 +/- 2 bpm in the old) and increased b…
17267113	Balance control and adaptation of kinematic synergy in aging adults during forward trunk bending.	aging	2007-03-19	The present study focuses on the organization of kinematic synergy and its adaptation to an unstable support surface during upper trunk movements in aging adults. Seven healthy aging adults (49-66 years old) were instructed to bend the trunk forward (the head and the trunk together) by about 40 degrees and to stabilize their final position, in the standard condition (both feet on the ground), and on a seesaw swinging in the sagittal plane. Kinematic synergy was quantified by performing a principal components analysis on the hip, knee and ankle angle changes during the movement. The results indicate that trunk bending was represented by a single component (PC1) in both conditions, indicating a strong coupling between the angle changes during the movement. The results also show a reorganization of the contribution of PC1 to the three angles when the balance constraints are increased in the seesaw condition. It is concluded that kinematic synergy is preserved during trunk bending in aging…
12470824	Biological aging research today: potential, peeves, and problems.	aging	????-??-??	Aging research has benefited immensely from the application of genetics during the past decade. This success frequently obscures some of the latent difficulties associated with this method. Interpretations of many experiments are overly optimistic. The emerging functional methods spawned by the knowledge of the genome promise a new window on the biological aging process. However, conceptual approaches have not quite caught up with the technology. An integrative approach to aging is needed, based on systems biology, to tap into this technology and to provide a deeper understanding of the operation of this complex process. The profound quantitative changes inherent in such phenomena as caloric restriction may actually result in stark qualitative changes in metabolism and aging. The ultimate goal is to understand the aging of the individual, and not simply to describe the mortality trajectories of the population. However, this will require the development of indices of frailty and of heal…
17964104	Metabolic changes in the normal ageing brain: consistent findings from short and long echo time proton spectroscopy.	aging	2008-11-??	OBJECTIVES: Sixty three healthy subjects were measured to assess dependence of brain metabolites on age using short- and long echo time spectroscopy in different brain regions.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: Younger and elderly humans were measured with long echo time (TE=135ms) 3D-MR-spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (10 subjects) and with ultra-short echo (TE=11ms) time 2D-MRSI (7 subjects). In addition, results from single voxel (1)H-spectroscopy (TE=20ms) of two cohorts of 46 healthy subjects were retrospectively correlated with age.    RESULTS: 3D-MR SI revealed reduced NAA/Cr in the older group in the frontal lobe (-22%; p<0.01), parietal lobe (-28%; p<0.01) and semiovale (-9%; p<0.01) compared to the younger group. Cho/Cr was elevated in the semiovale (+35%; p<0.01) and in the n. lentiformis (+42%; p<0.01) in the older group. NAA/Cho was reduced in all regions measured, except the thalamus, in the older group compared to the younger group (from -21 to -49%; p<0.01). 2D-MRSI revealed decrea…
12393950	Correlation between NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C in the ROS production by human granulocytes related to age.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Aging may be defined as gradual and progressive changes in an organism that increase the probability of death. Accumulating evidence now indicates that the sum of deleterious free radical reactions going on continuously throughout cells and tissues constitutes the aging process or is a major contributor to it.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to study the correlation between NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C (PKC) in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production related to age.    METHODS: The age-induced ROS generation was studied in healthy subjects ranging in age from 20 to 80 years, divided into six age groups: (1) 20-29, (2) 30-39, (3) 40-49, (4) 50-59, (5) 60-69, and (6) 70-80 years. The ROS were quantified using a chemiluminescence assay (luminol dependent) and the results expressed as RLU/s at maximum peak and total chemiluminescence (integral under the curve RLU/s).    RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a significant increase of the ROS production from 40 year…
15364801	Effect of aging and physical activity on left ventricular compliance.	aging	2004-09-28	BACKGROUND: Left ventricular compliance appears to decrease with aging, which may contribute to the high incidence of heart failure in the elderly. However, whether this change is an inevitable consequence of senescence or rather secondary to reduced physical activity is unknown.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve healthy sedentary seniors (69.8+/-3 years old; 6 women, 6 men) and 12 Masters athletes (67.8+/-3 years old; 6 women, 6 men) underwent pulmonary artery catheterization to define Starling and left ventricular pressure-volume curves. Data were compared with those obtained in 14 young but sedentary control subjects (28.9+/-5 years old; 7 women, 7 men). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes by use of echocardiography were measured at baseline, during decreased cardiac filling by use of lower-body negative pressure (-15 and -30 mm Hg), and after saline infusion (15 and 30 mL/kg). Stroke volume for any given filling pressure was greater in Master…
3417414	The aging lens: in vivo assessment of light absorption in 84 human eyes.	aging	1988-08-??	We have developed an apparatus and psychophysical paradigm for the reliable and practical measurement of light absorption by the human crystalline lens. Using this procedure we can partition a loss of sensitivity with aging into that attributable to changes in the lens and that due to other factors. The procedure eliminates effects of inaccurate refractive correction and misalignment, and reduces the effects of pupil size. Results on 84 eyes showed a gradual decrease in sensitivity with age, especially for short wavelengths. We noted considerable individual variability, which points up the value of using a procedure that assesses sensitivity loss due to lens absorption for each tested individual.
3518938	Renal function in the elderly.	aging	1986-05-??	A variety of anatomic abnormalities in the aging kidney have been identified, including decreased kidney size, increased glomerular sclerosis, and arteriolar vascular changes. Physiologic changes, including decreased renal blood flow, decreased glomerular filtration rate, altered renal tubular function, and altered renal endocrinologic function, have also been described. The clinical consequence of these changes is an altered ability of the aged kidney to respond to stress, either due to illness or due to therapeutic interventions by physicians. Extra caution and vigilance is therefore needed when caring for the elderly.
29056098	The Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale - Revised (ASA-R): Adaptation and Validation in a Sample of Spanish Older Adults.	aging	2017-10-23	Self-care agency is an important determinant of healthy aging. The Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale (ASA-R) (Sousa et al., 2010) is one of the main instrument to assess self-care capacity. The objectives of the study were: 1) to adapt and validate ASA-R scale for use in Spanish population; 2) to examine the dimensionality, validity and reliability; 3) and to establish the convergent validity of ASA-R using a self-reported health measure. The ASA-R Scale and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) were administered to 488 Spanish seniors aged 65 and over. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to analyze the dimensionality, validity and reliability. Convergent validity was tested by correlating the ASA-R factors with the SF-12 subscales; correlations were significant (p 0.05 (0.436), RMSEA closer to 0 (0.006), SRMR 0.95 (0.996 and 0.995). The results also demonstrated that ASA-R is a reliable and valid instrument. The ASA-R has demonstrated to be a reliable (CR indices > 0.…
27684096	Taste-Guided Isolation of Bitter Lignans from Quercus petraea and Their Identification in Wine.	aging	2016-??-28	Quercoresinosides A and B (1 and 2), two new lignans, were isolated from a toasted Quercus petraea heartwood extract along with a known compound, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenol 1-O-β-d-(6'-O-galloyl)glucopyranoside (3). The purification protocol was based on a taste-guided approach that sought to reveal new bitter compounds released from oak wood into wines and spirits. HRMS and NMR data were used to establish that compounds 1 and 2 are lignan derivatives bearing a glucosyl unit and a galloyl unit at the same positions. Hydrolysis of these compounds showed that they could be distinguished by the absolute configuration of their respective lyoniresinol genin as determined by chiral LC-HRMS in comparison with (+)- and (-)-lyoniresinol standards. Sensory analyses were performed in a non-oaked wine on the pure compounds 1-3. The three molecules exhibited a bitter taste at 2 mg/L that was particularly intense for compounds 2 and 3.

In this short review, selected aspects of body protein and amino-acid metabolism during aging in human subjects have been explored. There is a progressive diminution of total body protein with aging, due largely to a loss of skeletal muscle protein. These changes are accompanied by a shift in the overall pattern of whole body protein synthesis and breakdown, with muscle mass estimated to account for about 30 percent of whole body protein turnover in the young adult, as compared with a lower value of 20 percent or less in elderly subjects. There is no evidence that the loss of muscle protein is related to a reduced "amino acid tolerance" to insulin, since leucine-insulin metabolic relationships appear to remain intact during advancing adult age. However, because skeletal muscle mass plays an important role in the response to body protein and amino-acid metabolism to stress, such as that due to infection or trauma, this decline in the contribution of muscle to total body protein metaboli…
25498367	Relationships between tissue composition and viscoelastic properties in human trabecular bone.	aging	2015-01-21	Trabecular bone is a metabolically active tissue with a high surface to volume ratio. It exhibits viscoelastic properties that may change during aging. Changes in bone properties due to altered metabolism are sensitively revealed in trabecular bone. However, the relationships between material composition and viscoelastic properties of bone, and their changes during aging have not yet been elucidated. In this study, trabecular bone samples from the femoral neck of male cadavers (n=21) aged 17-82 years were collected and the tissue level composition and its associations with the tissue viscoelastic properties were evaluated by using Raman microspectroscopy and nanoindentation, respectively. For composition, collagen content, mineralization, carbonate substitution and mineral crystallinity were evaluated. The calculated mechanical properties included reduced modulus (Er), hardness (H) and the creep parameters (E1, E2, η1and η2), as obtained by fitting the experimental data to the Burgers …
22817535	Demographic evidence for adaptive theories of aging.	longevity, aging	2012-07-??	Pleiotropic theories for the evolutionary origins of senescence have been ascendant for forty years (see, for example, G. Williams (1957) Evolution, 11, 398-411; T. Kirkwood (1977) Nature, 270, 301-304), and it is not surprising that interpreters of demographic data seek to frame their results in this context. But some of that evidence finds a much more natural explanation in terms of adaptive aging. Here we re-interpret the 1997 results of the Centenarian Study in Boston, which found in their sample of centenarian women an excess of late childbearing. The finding was originally interpreted as a selection effect: a metabolic link between late menopause and longevity. But we demonstrate that this interpretation is statistically strained, and that the data in fact indicate a causal link: bearing a child late in life induces a metabolic response that promotes longevity. This conclusion directly contradicts some pleiotropic theories of aging that postulate a "cost of reproduction", and it …
16877960	Aging and vascular responses to flavanol-rich cocoa.	aging	2006-08-??	OBJECTIVES: Strong evidence has secured aging as a powerful predictor of both cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction, yet specific treatment is not available. We tested the hypothesis that vascular responsiveness to flavanol-rich cocoa increases with advancing age. We have previously shown that flavanol-rich cocoa induced peripheral vasodilation, improving endothelial function via a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism.    METHODS: We studied blood pressure and peripheral arterial responses to several days of cocoa in 15 young (< 50 years) and 19 older (> 50) healthy subjects.    RESULTS: The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) induced significant pressor responses following cocoa administration only among the older subjects: systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose 13 +/- 4 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 6 +/- 2 mmHg (P = 0.008 and 0.047, respectively); SBP was significantly higher in the older subjects (P < 0.05). Flow-media…
10536644	Effects of age and gender on the cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol.	aging	1999-09-??	We studied the effects of age and gender on cardiovascular responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation with the use of two-dimensional echocardiography in 16 young (aged 20-31) and 20 older (aged 60-75) healthy individuals. Following administration of atropine, each subject was given an infusion of isoproterenol at incremental doses from 0.010 to 0.030 microgram kg-1 min-1. The slopes of the fractional shortening-end-systolic wall stress (FS-sigma es) relationships were steeper in the young men (-0.87 +/- 0.28, n = 8) compared to the older men (-0.41 +/- 0.13, n = 10), and in the young women (-0.55 +/- 0.14, n = 8) compared to the older women (-0.38 +/- 0.13, n = 10). Furthermore, the magnitude of the age-associated differences in these slopes was larger in the men (old vs young) than in the women (old vs young) which, in the absence of changes in preload, suggests a greater decline in the contractile response to isoproterenol with advancing age in men compared to women. Furthermore, the …
24189210	Age-related changes across the primary and secondary somatosensory areas: an analysis of neuromagnetic oscillatory activities.	aging	2014-05-??	OBJECTIVE: Age-related changes are well documented in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Based on previous somatosensory evoked potential studies, the amplitude of N20 typically increases with age probably due to cortical disinhibition. However, less is known about age-related change in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The current study quantified age-related changes across SI and SII mainly based on oscillatory activity indices measured with magnetoencephalography.    METHODS: We recorded somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) to right median nerve stimulation in healthy young and old subjects and assessed major SEF components. Then, we evaluated the phase-locking factor (PLF) for local field synchrony on neural oscillations and the weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) for cortico-cortical synchrony between SI and SII.    RESULTS: PLF was significantly increased in SI along with the increased amplitude of N20m in the old subjects. PLF was also increased in SII associated …
15798372	Thermodynamics and information in aging: why aging is not a mystery and how we will be able to make rational interventions.	aging	2005-??-??	Currently, the aging research field lacks consensus in its focus and methodology. Foundational principles, such as the evolutionary origins and physiological definition of aging, remain controversial. The aim of this paper is to resolve these issues. By applying the concepts of thermodynamics and information in an evolutionary context, the aging phenotype can be derived from first principles. Life uses information storage to maintain its distance from thermodynamic equilibrium. Since it is impossible to make any process 100% efficient, a selective force (i.e., natural selection) is needed to maintain the information's viability. Natural selection operates upon generations, and for reasons discussed subsequently, the somatic body cannot implement an analogous selective process. The aging phenotype we see can be derived from this model along with a number of insights that will enhance our ability to make intelligent and rational interventions.
25263739	Education and mortality among older adults in China.	longevity	2015-02-??	This study examines the relationship between education and mortality, its underlying mechanisms, and its gender and age variations among older adults in China, using data from the 2002 to 2011 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. There is an inverse relationship between education and mortality risk. The relationship is explained in full by each of the three mechanisms: other socioeconomic attainments, social relationships and activities, and health status, and partially by physical exercise. In addition, primary education has a stronger effect on mortality for men than for women and the effect of education is stronger for the young old than for the oldest old. These findings underscore the importance of national and subpopulation contexts in understanding the relationship between education and mortality.
17725475	Position affects distribution of ventilation in the lungs of older people: an experimental study.	aging	2007-??-??	QUESTION: What is the effect of sitting and side-lying on the distribution of ventilation during tidal breathing in healthy older people?    DESIGN: Randomised, within-participant, experimental study.    PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy people more than 65 years old.    INTERVENTION: Tidal breathing during sitting and right side-lying.    OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of ventilation as a percentage of total counts using Technetium-99m Technegas lung ventilation imaging.    RESULTS: In sitting, the ratio of the distribution of ventilation to apical: middle: basal regions was 1: 3.5: 3.3 in the right lung, and 1: 2.9: 2.3 in the left lung. In right side-lying, 32% (95% CI 22 to 43) more ventilation was distributed to the right lung than to the left lung. The ratio of the distribution of ventilation to apical: middle: basal regions was 1: 2.8: 2.2 in the right lung, and 1: 2.4: 1.9 in the left lung.    CONCLUSIONS: In both sitting and right side-lying, ventilation was distributed more to the mi…
12092790	Circadian temporal organization of lipidic fractions in elderly people. Entrainment to the dietary schedule.	aging	2002-04-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Changes in some rhythmometric parameters have been reported in the elderly as a consequence of both structural and neurochemical changes occurring in the central nervous system. Since alterations of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are directly involved in several age-related disorders, the aim of this study was to investigate the circadian temporal organization of some important lipidic fractions (total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein A1 and B) in physiological aging.    METHODS: Thirty old hospitalized subjects were synchronized for daily activities, sleeping/waking habits, and time/quality of meals. Twenty-four healthy young individuals served as controls. After an overnight fast, samples were taken beginning at 08:00 every 4 hours until 20:00, and every 2 hours from 20:00 to 04:00. Rhythmometric data were analyzed by single and population mean Cosinor analysis, and by ANOVA; the comparison of the rhythm's parameters between elderly and young subjec…
23416185	N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride-based method for the measurement of plasma oxidative capacity during human aging.	aging	2013-05-15	N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (DMPD) is a compound that is normally used to measure the antioxidant potential. In the presence of Fe(3+), it gets converted to DMPD(∙+) radical, which is scavenged by antioxidant molecules present in test samples. In plasma, due to the presence of iron, this method cannot be applied for the measurement of antioxidant potential. The modified DMPD method proposed by us measures with great accuracy the oxidant potential of plasma using the oxidizing effect of plasma to oxidize DMPD into producing a stable pink color. The method is fast and reproducible. We show that plasma oxidative capacity increases significantly during human aging.
15298990	Insulin-like growth factor-2 genotype, fat-free mass, and muscle performance across the adult life span.	aging	2004-12-??	The influence of insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) genotype on total body fat-free mass (FFM), muscle strength, and sustained power (SP) was evaluated repeatedly at approximately 2-yr intervals in two cohorts from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Cohort 1 was comprised of 94 men tested for isometric grip strength and SP. Cohort 2 was comprised of 246 men and 239 women tested for total body FFM and isokinetic peak torque. Subjects were retrospectively genotyped for the IGF2 gene's ApaI polymorphism. Differences between genotype groups for total FFM, strength, and SP at first visit, at peak age (35 yr), at age 65, and across the adult age span were analyzed using either two-sample t-tests or mixed-effects models, depending on the specific comparisons made. Isokinetic arm strength at the time of first visit was lower in A/A men than in G/G men (P < 0.05). Compared with G/G women, A/A women had lower total body FFM, lower isokinetic arm and leg strength at the time of first vis…
20345278	arNOX: generator of reactive oxygen species in the skin and sera of aging individuals subject to external modulation.	aging	????-??-??	An aging-related cell-surface oxidase (aging-related NADH oxidase, arNOX) generating superoxide and other reactive oxygen species is shed from the cell surface and is found in saliva, urine, perspiration, and interstitial fluids that surround the collagen and elastin matrix underlying dermis. arNOX activity correlates with age and reaches a maximum at about age 65 in males and 55 in females. arNOX activities are highly correlated with values of human skin where a causal relationship is indicated. Ongoing efforts focus on cloning arNOX proteins and development of antiaging formulas based on arNOX inhibition (intervention).
7898640	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuropeptide Y- and somatostatin-like immunoreactivities in man.	aging	1994-12-??	We have measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in control subjects and in patients with various neurologic disorders. We observed a significant reduction in CSF SLI in control subjects over 60 years of age, compared with the younger controls. CSF SLI was significantly decreased in multiple sclerosis (MS), or Guillain-Barre syndrome, compared with that of age-matched control subjects. A reduced concentration of NPY-LI was found in CSF of patients with MS. We have also examined the molecular heterogeneity of peptide-LI in CSF. Gel chromatography, not high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), suggested two NPY immunoreactive materials in CSF. Gel chromatography and HPLC revealed three SLI components in CSF: somatostatin 14, somatostatin 28 and a higher molecular weight precursor. Our results suggest that 1) there may be more than one form of NPY in human CSF, and 2) somatostatin neurons might be mo…
8498491	Myofibrillar protein synthesis in young and old men.	aging	1993-05-??	We tested the hypothesis that healthy older men (> 60 yr old) have a slower rate of myofibrillar protein synthesis than young men (< 35 yr old). Myofibrillar protein synthesis was determined by the in vivo incorporation of L-[1-13C]leucine into myofibrillar proteins obtained by muscle biopsy. Subjects were eight young (21-31 yr) and eight older (62-81 yr) men, all healthy and moderately active. There was no significant difference in the mean height and weight of the two age groups, but the older group had 12% less lean body mass (determined by 40K counting) and 21% less muscle mass (estimated by urinary creatinine excretion). Upper leg strength was approximately one-third lower in the older subjects according to isokinetic dynamometry. The fractional rate of myofibrillar protein synthesis was 28% slower in the older group (0.039 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.054 +/- 0.010 %/h, mean +/- SD, P < 0.01). Total myofibrillar protein synthesis, estimated as total myofibrillar mass (from creatinine excretio…
29137999	Structural and functional changes of fibrinogen due to aging.	longevity, aging	2018-03-??	Different factors affect coagulation process. Since fibrinogen is the main coagulation factor, the influence of aging on fibrinogen structure and function was investigated in this study. Fibrinogen was isolated from plasma obtained from healthy persons in the age range 21-83 and examined. Lectin microarray analysis demonstrated increased glycosylation of fibrinogen due to aging, with predominant increase in high-mannose or hybrid type N-glycans, as well as tri-/tetraantennary complex N-glycans with greater content of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine residues. Spectrofluorimetric analysis indicated that fibrinogen molecules have more densely packed structure, but there are no additional advanced glycation end products with increasing age. According to the results of functional analysis, fibrinogen molecules isolated from older persons exhibited reduced clotting time, with significant positive correlation with age, but there were no differences in clotting speed, maximal optical density…
17301044	Cardiolocomotor coupling in young and elderly people.	aging	2007-01-??	BACKGROUND: Walking is a complex act that requires the coordination of locomotor, cardiovascular, and autonomic systems. Aging affects each of these systems and may alter physiological mechanisms regulating the interactions between them.    METHODS: We examined the effects of healthy aging on cardiac-locomotor coupling using treadmill walking at incremental speeds from 0.8 mph to normal walking speed in 12 healthy young (29.0 +/- 5.0 years) and 9 healthy elderly persons (70.3 +/- 5.1 years). interbeat (R-R) intervals, step intervals, maximum foot pressure (MFP) and normalized maximum force, blood pressure (BP), and blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery were continuously measured.    RESULTS: Step intervals and R-R intervals decreased, and MFP and BFV increased with walking speed in both groups; systolic BP increased (p <.0001) in the old group. In elderly, but not in young participants, step intervals and R-R intervals were coupled (R(2) = 0.84, p <.0001), and MFP was…
28391817	MotorBrain: A mobile app for the assessment of users' motor performance in neurology.	aging	2017-05-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Human motor skills or impairments have been traditionally assessed by neurologists by means of paper-and-pencil tests or special hardware. More recently, technologies such as digitizing tablets and touchscreens have offered neurologists new assessment possibilities, but their use has been restricted to a specific medical condition, or to stylus-operated mobile devices. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a mobile app (MotorBrain) that offers six computerized versions of traditional motor tests, can be used directly by patients (with and without the supervision of a clinician), and aims at turning millions of smartphones and tablets available to the general public into data collection and assessment tools. Then, we carry out a study to determine whether the data collected by MotorBrain can be meaningful for describing aging in human motor performance.    METHODS: A sample of healthy participants (N= 133) carried out the motor tests using M…
28232199	Impact of maximal strength training on work efficiency and muscle fiber type in the elderly: Implications for physical function and fall prevention.	aging	2017-??-??	Although aging is typically associated with a decreased efficiency of locomotion, somewhat surprisingly, there is also a reduction in the proportion of less efficient fast-twitch Type II skeletal muscle fibers and subsequently a greater propensity for falls. Maximal strength training (MST), with an emphasis on velocity in the concentric phase, improves maximal strength, the rate of force development (RFD), and work efficiency, but the impact on muscle morphology in the elderly is unknown. Therefore we evaluated force production, walking work efficiency, and muscle morphology in 11 old (72±3years) subjects before and after MST of the legs. Additionally, for reference, the MST-induced morphometric changes were compared with 7 old (74±6years) subjects who performed conventional strength training (CST), with focus on hypertrophy, as well as 13 young (24±2years) controls. As expected, MST in the old improved maximal strength (68%), RFD (48%), and work efficiency (12%), restoring each to a l…
21519868	Central adaptations to repetitive grasping in healthy aging.	lifespan, aging	2011-10-??	Augmented cortical activity during repetitive grasping mitigates repetition-related decrease in cortical efficiency in young adults. It is unclear if similar processes occur with healthy aging. We recorded movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) during 150 repetitive handgrip contractions at 70% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in healthy young (n = 10) and old (n = 10) adults. Repetitions were grouped into two Blocks (Block 1 and 2: repetitions 1-60 and 91-150, respectively) and analyzed separately to assess the effects of aging and block. EMG of the flexor digitorum superficialis and handgrip force were also recorded. No changes in EMG or MVC were observed across blocks for either group. Significant interactions (P < 0.05) were observed for MRCPs recorded from mesial (FCz, Cz, CPz) and motor (C1, C3, Cz) electrode sites, with younger adults demonstrating significant increases in MRCP amplitude. Focal MRCP activity in response to repetitive grasping resulted in minimal chang…
28473644	Moment-to-Moment BOLD Signal Variability Reflects Regional Changes in Neural Flexibility across the Lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2017-??-31	Variability of neuronal responses is thought to underlie flexible and optimal brain function. Because previous work investigating BOLD signal variability has been conducted within task-based fMRI contexts on adults and older individuals, very little is currently known regarding regional changes in spontaneous BOLD signal variability in the human brain across the lifespan. The current study used resting-state fMRI data from a large sample of male and female human participants covering a wide age range (6-85 years) across two different fMRI acquisition parameters (TR = 0.645 and 1.4 s). Variability in brain regions including a key node of the salience network (anterior insula) increased linearly across the lifespan across datasets. In contrast, variability in most other large-scale networks decreased linearly over the lifespan. These results demonstrate unique lifespan trajectories of BOLD variability related to specific regions of the brain and add to a growing literature demonstrating …
11152137	Analysis of isoaspartate in peptides by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.	aging	2000-11-??	In view of the significance of Asn deamidation and Asp isomerization to isoAsp at certain sites for protein aging and turnover, it was desirable to challenge the extreme analytical power of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) for the possibility of a site-specific detection of this posttranslational modification. For this purpose, synthetic L-Asp/L-isoAsp containing oligopeptide pairs were investigated by ESI-MS/MS and low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). Replacement of L-Asp by L-isoAsp resulted in the same kind of shifts for all 15 peptide pairs investigated: (1) the b/y intensity ratio of complementary b and y ions generated by cleavage of the (L-Asp/L-isoAsp)-X bond and of the X-(L-Asp/L-isoAsp) bond was decreased, and (2) the Asp immonium ion abundance at m/z 88 was also decreased. It is proposed that the isoAsp structure hampers the accepted mechanism of b-ion formation on both its N- and C-terminal side. The b/y ion intensity ratio and the relative immo…
23542868	Cognitive lifestyle in older persons: the population-based Sydney Memory and Ageing Study.	lifespan	2013-??-??	BACKGROUND: Cognitive lifestyle may be an important modifiable risk factor for dementia but has not yet been comprehensively studied in healthy elderly.    OBJECTIVE: To examine gender- and lifespan-related differences in cognitive lifestyle in a population-based cohort.    METHODS: 872 individuals from the second wave of the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) cohort were invited to complete the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ), a validated measure of cognitive lifestyle. Of 555 questionnaires returned (64%), 253 were excluded due to prior diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, leaving n = 302 cognitively-intact elders (mean age 80.1 years, ±SD 4.7, 40.1% men).    RESULTS: Total LEQ was significantly higher in men (97.9 ± 20.0) than women (90.0 ± 24.5), resulting mainly from midlife LEQ differences. Men were more likely to have worked in managerial or professional jobs (73.8% versus 39.5% women), and twice as likely to have supervised large groups of workers. In late life…
21843646	Calibrated fMRI during a cognitive Stroop task reveals reduced metabolic response with increasing age.	aging	2012-01-16	fMRI studies of aging have revealed increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response to tasks of executive function with advancing age, which is generally interpreted as increased neural activity. However, changes in the cerebrovascular system with age can alter the BOLD signal, complicating this interpretation. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) allows simultaneous acquisition of BOLD and cerebral blood flow (CBF) information and can be used to quantify the component parts of the BOLD signal. We used this calibrated BOLD approach in 58 healthy participants over an age range of 18-71 years to determine the relative vascular and neuronal contributions to the age-related BOLD changes in response to a Stroop task. The percentage BOLD response increased significantly with increasing age but the percentage CBF response did not alter, such that the BOLD increase is attributed to a significant reduction in the oxygen metabolism response with increasing age. Hence, in this study, the BOLD…
24485466	Task-dependent activity and connectivity predict episodic memory network-based responses to brain stimulation in healthy aging.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can affect episodic memory, one of the main cognitive hallmarks of aging, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.    OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the behavioral and functional impact of excitatory TMS in a group of healthy elders.    METHODS: We applied a paradigm of repetitive TMS - intermittent theta-burst stimulation - over left inferior frontal gyrus in healthy elders (n = 24) and evaluated its impact on the performance of an episodic memory task with two levels of processing and the associated brain activity as captured by a pre and post fMRI scans.    RESULTS: In the post-TMS fMRI we found TMS-related activity increases in left prefrontal and cerebellum-occipital areas specifically during deep encoding but not during shallow encoding or at rest. Furthermore, we found a task-dependent change in connectivity during the encoding task between cerebellum-occipital areas and the TMS-targeted left inferior frontal region. This connecti…
11808774	Age and sex influence on oxidative damage and functional status in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2001-??-??	A reduction in muscle mass, with consequent decrease in strength and resistance, is commonly observed with advancing age. In this study we measured markers of oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins, some antioxidant enzyme activities as well Ca2+ transport in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis of young and elderly healthy subjects of both sexes in order to evaluate the presence of age- and sex-related differences. We found a significant increase in oxidation of DNA and lipids in the elderly group, more evident in males, and a reduction in catalase and glutathione transferase activities. The experiments on Ca2+ transport showed an abnormal functional response of aged muscle after exposure to caffeine, which increases the opening of Ca2+ channels, as well a reduced activity of the Ca2+ pump in elderly males. From these results we conclude that oxidative stress play an important role in muscle aging and that oxidative damage is much more eviden…
20558832	Subjective mild depressive symptoms are associated with abnormal diurnal cycle of salivary cortisol in older adults.	aging	2011-03-??	BACKGROUND: Alterations in cortisol secretion pattern seem to be involved in the associations between aging, depression, and cognitive decline.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to mainly assess cortisol circadian profile in older adults with subjective depressive symptoms.    METHODS: Salivary cortisol samples from healthy young (n = 22) and old adults (n = 22), and from older adults who self-reported depressive symptoms in Geriatric Depression Scale (n = 22) were collected at 7 AM, 4 PM, and 10 PM and were analyzed by radioimmunoassay.    RESULTS: Older adults with depressive symptoms presented the characteristic cortisol circadian pattern, but they showed higher cortisol levels at 10 PM than healthy young and elderly controls.    CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mild depressive symptoms could be associated with a cortisol secretion pattern previously described as being predictive of cognitive decline.
20457166	Effects of aging on mindreading ability through the eyes: an fMRI study.	aging	2010-07-??	Theory of Mind--ToM, the capacity to understand one's own and other people's mental states and to refer to them to foresee and explain the behaviour--relies upon a circumscribed neural system: the posterior end of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the adjacent temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the temporal pole (TP), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the adjacent paracingulate cortex. To our knowledge, the neural basis of mentalizing has not yet been studied in a developmental perspective covering old age, so the aim of this work is to compare the neural basis of a specific aspect of ToM, the mindreading ability through the eyes, in healthy young and old subjects. Two groups of healthy adults (young: 25.2 years; old: 65.2 years) were submitted to an fMRI scanning while performing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, which requires the attribution of a mental state to the other person focussing only on the eye-gaze. There was no difference in the behavioural performances betwe…
21956574	Analysis of D-β-aspartyl isomers at specific sites in proteins.	aging	2012-??-??	Recent studies have shown that biologically uncommon D-β-aspartic acid residues accumulate in specific proteins during the aging process. However, aspartyl residues are not racemized uniformly because D-Asp appears to be confined to particular sites in these proteins. We here describe the method to identify the specific sites of D-β-aspartic acids inversion in proteins.
10683616	Occurrence of serum M-protein species in Japanese patients older than 50 years based on relative mobility in cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis.	aging	2000-??-??	We investigated the occurrence of serum M-protein species in 2,007 Japanese patients older than 50 years of age. All sera samples were analyzed by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis. The relative mobility of an M-protein band was calculated by dividing the migration distance of M protein by that of albumin. M proteins were found to be present in 71 of 2,007 cases (3.5%). Men 80-89 years old showed the highest occurrence of M proteins, 11.0%. The relative mobility of M-protein bands, especially the band of the IgA-type M protein, increased as the patient's age advanced. The patients had higher levels of the IgG-type M protein than healthy Japanese subjects. We found that the occurrence of M-protein species in Japanese patients increases with their age. The IgG-type M protein was most frequently expressed among other types. The mobility of the M protein was greater in older patients probably because of aging-related changes in the carbohydrate chain of immunoglobulins composing a…
19852071	Dopamine transporter PET in normal aging: dopamine transporter decline and its possible role in preservation of motor function.	aging	2010-02-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of age-related decline in dopamine transporter (DAT) expression on motor function in the elderly.    METHODS: About 33 normal individuals of a wide age range were scanned with PET employing d-threo-[(11)C]-methylphenidate (MP, a marker of DAT) and [(11)C]-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ, that binds to the vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2). Motor function was assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPB). We analyzed the relationship between [(11)C]-MP and motor performance.    RESULTS: Age ranged from 27- to 77-year old (mean +/- SD, 54.75 +/- 14.14). There was no age-related decline in binding potentials (BP) for [(11)C]-DTBZ. In contrast, [(11)C]-MP BP was inversely related to age in all striatal regions analyzed (caudate: reduction of 11.2% per decade, P < 0.0001, r = -0.86; putamen: reduction of 10.5% per decade, P < 0.0001, r = -0.80). A differential effect of [(11)C]-MP on PPB could be observed according to age group. There was a positive rela…
29370215	High levels of incidental physical activity are positively associated with cognition and EEG activity in aging.	lifespan, aging	2018-??-??	High levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan. Several studies have found that aerobic exercise enhances cognition and likely prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. Nevertheless, the association of incidental physical activity (IPA) with health and cognition during aging has not been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of IPA level with cognitive functions and resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy old participants. Participants (n = 97) with normal scores on psychometric and neuropsychological tests and normal values in blood analyses were included. A cluster analysis based on the scores of the Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) allowed the formation of two groups: active, with high levels of IPA, and passive, with low levels of IPA. Eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded from the participants; the fast Fourier transform was used offline to calculate absolute power (AP), relative power …
3596993	Non-tryptophan fluorescence of crystallins from normal and cataractous human lenses.	aging	1987-07-??	The soluble proteins of a newborn human lens exhibit almost no non-tryptophan fluorescence. On aging, an increase in the fluorescence of all native crystallins is found except for gamma 2-crystallin. With formation of nuclear cataract, a further increase is seen for gamma 1-crystallin. The fluorophore, excitation 355 nm/emission 420 nm, is mainly associated with one species of the gamma 1-crystallin population. It is also present as such in the soluble fraction and increases significantly with nuclear cataract formation. At least one of the gamma 1-crystallins seems to play an important role in the cataractogenic process.
16337884	Regulation of replicative senescence by NADP+ -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.	aging	2006-01-01	The free radical hypothesis of aging postulates that senescence is due to an accumulation of cellular oxidative damage, caused largely by reactive oxygen species that are produced as by-products of normal metabolic processes. Recently, we demonstrated that the control of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance and the cellular defense against oxidative damage is one of the primary functions of cytosolic (IDPc) and mitochondrial NADP+ -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm) by supplying NADPH for antioxidant systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that modulation of IDPc or IDPm activity in IMR-90 cells regulates cellular redox status and replicative senescence. When we examined the regulatory role of IDPc and IDPm against the aging process with IMR-90 cells transfected with cDNA for IDPc or IDPm in sense and antisense orientations, a clear inverse relationship was observed between the amount of IDPc or IDPm expressed in target cells and their susceptibility to senescence, which was…
10842418	The nutritional intake of a free-living healthy French population : a four-year follow-up.	aging	2000-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To contribute to a better definition of the nutritional requirements of the healthy elderly and to improved knowledge the effects of age on these requirements.    METHODS: We studied the nutritional intake of 96 elderly persons who had met criteria of good health status in 1993 at a four-year interval. The nutritional intake of the elderly subjects who remained healthy during the four-year interval (18 men and 64 women), was considered to globally correspond to their nutritional needs. The nutritional intake was evaluated by a three-day food record.    RESULTS: The mean baseline weight of the subjects who remained in good health during the four years was 72,6 +/- 9,5 kg for men and 60,1 +/- 9,3 kg for women. In four years, mean weight remained globally stable. But in cross-sectional analysis, weight tended to decrease with the age of the subjects. This decrease was significant for women in 1993. Mean baseline intake was nearly 29 kcal/kg. Longitudinal and cross-sectional ana…
22241054	Handling objects in old age: forces and moments acting on the object.	aging	2012-04-??	We measured the external moments and digit-tip force directions acting on a freely moveable object while it was grasped and manipulated by old (OA) and young (YA) adults. Participants performed a grasp and lift task and a precision orientation (key-slot) task with a precision (thumb-finger) grip. During the grasp-lift task the OA group misaligned their thumb and finger contacts and produced greater grip force, greater external moments on the object around its roll axis, and oriented force vectors differently compared with the YA group. During the key-slot task, the OA group was more variable in digit-tip force directions and performed the key-slot task more slowly. With practice the OA group aligned their digits, reduced their grip force, and minimized external moments on the object, clearly demonstrating that the nervous system monitored and actively manipulated one or more variables related to object tilt. This was true even for the grip-lift task, a task for which no instructions re…
12714117	Aging, physical activity, and cognitive processing: an examination of P300.	aging	????-??-??	Physical activity appears to attenuate the decline of cognitive function typically observed in older men and women. The P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) is particularly affected by aging and allows for basic neurobiological assessment of cognitive function. Three aspects of the P300 component (i.e. latency, amplitude, and area under the curve (AUC)), elicited by an oddball task, were derived to assess cognitive function in young and older participants (N=73) who were further classified as high- and low-active. The low-active elderly participants exhibited larger AUC values than those observed in all other groups which were undifferentiated. That is, the high-active elderly and the young participants exhibited smaller AUC values than the low-active older group. In conclusion, higher levels of physical activity in the elderly may be associated with a reduction in the neural resources allocated in response to simple cognitive challenge. This interpretation is consistent…
23855185	Predictors and characteristics of successful aging among men: a 48-year longitudinal study.	aging	2013-??-??	To explore dimensions of successful aging, 71 men were selected for healthy adjustment and were prospectively studied in young adulthood (average age 20) and reassessed in 32-year and 48-year follow-ups. Despite an increase of medical problems, most men maintained healthy adjustment in early old age. At both follow-ups, successful young adult predictors of favorable overall outcome included good peer social adjustment, an absence of troubled parental discipline, and an absence of immature defensive behaviors when angry. However, young adult factors were more predictive of outcomes in middle age than in early old age, as predictor effect sizes decreased between the first follow-up and the second follow-up 16 years later. Findings support the possibility of both favorable and unfavorable changes in the second half of life that may diminish the impact of some young adult characteristics and family environments on adjustment in early old age.
16257477	Social and biological determinants of cognitive aging.	aging	2005-12-??	The aging of populations increases the importance of cognitive function as a public health issue. The Whitehall II study is investigating influences on aging processes within social context, with tests in five domains of cognitive function (short-term memory, inductive reasoning, vocabulary, phonemic and semantic fluency). The tests have now been completed three times over a 10-year period, by participants initially aged 40-60 years. In mid-life, socioeconomic differences in cognitive function were large, while APOE genotype had little influence. Higher occupational status was strongly related to lower metabolic syndrome prevalence. This social-biological gradient illustrates that potential confounding of psychosocial, behavioral and biological effects on cognitive decline is an important consideration in etiologic research. Additionally, it highlights the importance for population health of the 'causes of the causes' of cognitive aging. Epidemiology contributes to our understanding of…
25288053	Associations between socioeconomic status, aging and functionality among older women.	aging	????-??-??	To assess if there is an association between socioeconomic status and quality of life, functional status and markers of aging, we studied 86 women aged 73 ± 7 years, who answered the WHO Qol Bref quality of life survey. Mini mental state examination, timed up and go test, 12 minutes' walk, hand grip and quadriceps strength, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), carotid intima-media thickness and telomere length in peripheral leukocytes were measured. Successful aging was defined as a walking speed, handgrip strength, appendicular lean body mass, timed up and go and minimental values above cutoff points for disability. Participants with successful aging had a higher quality of life score and were more likely to live in rich municipalities. There was a positive correlation between telomere length, right handgrip strength and total fat free mass. Therefore, there is an association between socioeconomic status, successful aging and quality of life.
17292629	Relationship between white matter fractional anisotropy and other indices of cerebral health in normal aging: tract-based spatial statistics study of aging.	aging	2007-04-01	White matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) is thought to be related to WM integrity and decline in FA is often used as an index of decreasing WM health. However, the relationship of FA to other structural indices of cerebral health has not been well studied. We hypothesized that the decline in WM health will be associated with changes in several other indices of cerebral health. In this manuscript we studied the correlation between whole-brain/hemispheric/corpus callosum FA and gray matter (GM) thickness, sulcal span, and the volume of T2-hyperintense WM in a group of 31 healthy aging individuals (12 males/19 females) aged 57-82 years old. Individual subjects' FA measures were calculated from diffusion tracing imaging (DTI) data using tract-based spatial statistics--an approach specifically designed and validated for voxel-wise multi-subject FA analysis. Age-controlled correlation analysis showed that whole-brain average FA values were significantly and positively correlated with the…
21905209	P-glycoprotein activity in human Caucasian male lymphocytes does not follow its increased expression during aging.	aging	2011-11-??	P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transmembrane protein that mediates the efflux of innumerous structurally unrelated compounds. It was initially found over-expressed in tumor cells, associated to a multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR). Then, P-gp was found constitutively expressed in excretory cells/tissues and in circulating cells, such as lymphocytes. Considering the importance of this transporter in the establishment of therapeutic protocols and the existence of contradictory results, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of aging in the expression and function of P-gp in human lymphocytes, comparing two different methodologies to assess both parameters. P-gp activity and expression were evaluated in lymphocytes isolated from whole blood samples of 65 healthy caucasian male donors, divided into two groups according to age (group 1: under 30-years old; group 2: above 60-years old). P-gp expression was assessed using the anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody, UIC2, in the presence and in abs…
8227990	Specific humoral immunity in the elderly: in vivo and in vitro response to vaccination.	aging	1993-11-??	Vaccinations are often unsuccessful in preventing infection among elderly populations because of generally poor humoral immune responses. We have used tetanus toxoid (TT) antigen to stimulate in vitro anti-tetanus toxoid antibody (anti-TT) synthesis and have found that lymphocytes from many healthy elderly individuals have a reduced production of anti-TT in vitro compared to young adults. This is associated with decreased numbers of B cells secreting anti-TT IgG and a decrease in the mean amount of anti-TT IgG produced per TT-specific B cell. In the present study we report that immunization results in a significant increase in serum titers in young adults for up to one year, whereas levels in old adults fall to baseline by 6 months. The number of B cells that secrete anti-TT IgG increases after immunizations in both young and old subjects, although the number in old subjects is significantly lower than in young subjects at all times except 6 months after. The mean amount of anti-TT pro…
9252080	Multiple hepatic mitochondrial DNA deletions suggest premature oxidative aging in alcoholic patients.	aging	1997-07-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: A 4977-base pair deletion has been detected in the hepatic mitochondrial DNA of alcoholic patients with microvesicular steatosis, a lesion ascribed to impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation. However, only a single deletion had been looked for in this previous study, and it could not be determined whether the deletion was preexisting or acquired. Alcohol abuse increases the formation of reactive oxygen species in hepatic mitochondria. If this effect accelerates the oxidative aging of mitochondrial DNA, several other mutations would be expected.    METHODS: The mtDNA region extending from nucleotide 8167 to nucleotide 14246 was screened for the presence of large mitochondrial DNA deletions in 58 alcoholic patients and 67 age-matched non-alcoholic controls. Hepatic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reactions that amplified non-deleted and deleted mitochondrial DNA, respectively, and the boundaries of the mitochondrial DNA deletions were sequenced.    RESULTS: Only 3% o…
15862203	Age-dependent brain activation during forward and backward digit recall revealed by fMRI.	aging	2005-05-15	In this study, brain activation associated with forward and backward digit recall was examined in healthy old and young adults using functional MRI. A number of areas were activated during the recall. In young adults, greater activation was found in the left prefrontal cortex (BA9) and the left occipital visual cortex during backward digit recall than forward digit recall. In contrast, the activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45) was more extensive in forward digit recall than in backward digit recall. In older adults, backward recall generated stronger activation than forward recall in most areas, including the frontal, the parietal, the occipital, and the temporal cortices. In the backward recall condition, the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA44/45) showed more activation in the old group than in the young group. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms may be involved in forward and backward digit recall and brain functions associated with these two ty…
22054872	Healthy aging attenuates task-related specialization in the human medial temporal lobe.	aging	2012-09-??	Recent research on aging has established important links between the neurobiology of normal aging and age-related decline in episodic memory, yet the exact nature of this relationship is still unknown. Functional neuroimaging of regions such as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) have produced conflicting findings. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have recently shown that young healthy individuals show a stronger activation of the MTL during encoding of objects as compared with encoding of positions. Using the same encoding task, the present study addressed the question whether this greater MTL activation during encoding of objects varies with age. Fifty-four healthy individuals aged between 18 and 81 years underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and subsequently made new-old judgments on objects and positions. Region of interest (ROI) analysis of task related changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was performed in native s…
10496111	Between 21 and 34 years of age, aging alters the catecholamine responses to supramaximal exercise in endurance trained athletes.	aging	1999-08-??	The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of aging and training on the adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) responses during the Wingate-test in three age groups of subjects: 21 year old untrained subjects (21U), 21 year old endurance trained (21T) (national elite runners), 34 year old endurance trained (34T) (national elite runners). Performances during the test were judged using the usual parameters of peak power (Wmax) and mean power (W) expressed in absolute or relative values. A and NA responses were measured at rest (A0 and NA0) immediately at the end of the exercise (Amax and NAmax) and after 5 minutes recovery (A5 and NA5). Plasma maximal lactate (La(max)) was determined 3 minutes after the end of the exercise. Wmax, W and La(max) were always significantly lower in 34T compared to 21T and 21U. The catecholamine responses were similar in 21T and 21U. Inversely, a significantly lower value of Amax was observed in 34T (2.01 +/- 0.5 nmol x l(-1)) compared to 21U (3.62 …
20133393	Extracellular water may mask actual muscle atrophy during aging.	aging	2010-05-??	BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle tissue holds a large volume of water partitioned into extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) fractions. As the ECW may not be related to muscle strength directly, we hypothesized that excluding ECW from muscle volume would strengthen the correlation with muscle strength.    METHODS: A total of 119 healthy men aged 20-88 years old participated in this study. Knee isometric extension strength, vertical jump, and standing from a chair were measured as indices of muscle strength and power in the lower extremities. The regional lean volume (LV), total water (TW), ICW, and ECW in the lower leg were estimated by anthropometry (skinfold and circumference measurements) and segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (S-BIS). Then, we calculated the ECW/TW and ICW/TW ratios.    RESULTS: Although ICW and the LV index decreased significantly with age (p < .001), no significant changes in ECW were observed (p = .134). Consequently, the …
26258853	The Relationships between Age and Running Biomechanics.	lifespan, aging	2016-01-??	UNLABELLED: Running has high injury rates, especially among older runners. Most aging literature compares young with old runners without accounting for the progression of biomechanics throughout the lifespan. We used age as a continuous variable to investigate the continuum of age-related gait adaptations in running along with determining the chronology and rate of these adaptations.    PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the relations among age and selected running biomechanics throughout the range of 18-60 yr.    METHODS: Experienced (n = 110) healthy runners (male, 54%) provided informed consent and ran at their training pace while motion and force data were captured. Kinematics, ground reaction forces (GRF), and lower limb joint torques and powers were correlated with age using Pearson product-moment correlations and linear regression.    RESULTS: Running velocity was inversely related to age (r = -0.27, P = 0.005) because of decreased stride length (r = -0.25, P = 0.008) but not…
9541139	Behavior pattern, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, superoxide dismutase, micro-blood-flow state and longevity or aging.	longevity, aging	1998-01-30	It is believed that the mechanisms of aging or longevity are multifactorial. We selected four major postnatal factors to verify the mechanisms of longevity and aging. Type B behavior is strongly associated with longevity. The frequency of Type B behavior pattern (55.5 vs. 26.6%) was significantly higher while Type A behavior pattern (2.4 vs. 5.9%) was much lower in the longevity group compared with those in the elderly group (P < 0.01). The decline of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) might relate to the aging process which was supported by two facts: (1) low PaO2 might lead to high frequency of chromosomal aberrations, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was 1.22+/-0.53%, 0.57+/-0.23% and 0.23+/-0.22% in PaO2 < 75, 75-84 or > or = 85 mmHg groups respectively (P < 0.025); (2) the lower the PaO2, the more serious the retina arteriosclerosis. Five mean contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in erythrocytes were 626+/-39, 583+/-56, 556+/-43, 547+/-49 and 557+/-40 microg/gHb …
11368920	Age-related mitochondrial genotypic and phenotypic alterations in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2001-06-01	To have a clearer picture of how mitochondrial damages are associated to aging, a comprehensive study of phenotypic and genotypic alterations was carried out, analyzing with histochemical and molecular biology techniques the same skeletal muscle specimens of a large number of healthy subjects from 13 to 92 years old. Histochemical data showed that ragged red fibers (RRF) appear at about 40 years of age and are mostly cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-positive, whereas they are almost all COX-negative thereafter. Molecular analyses showed that the 4977 bp deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA(4977)) and the 7436 bp deletion of mtDNA (mtDNA(7436)) are already present in individuals younger than 40 years of age, but their occurrence does not change with age. After 40 years of age the number of mtDNA deleted species, as revealed by Long Extension PCR (LX-PCR), increases, the 10422 bp deletion of mtDNA (mtDNA(10422)) appears, although with a very low frequency of occurrence, and mtDNA content is mo…
12427416	Compensatory changes in atrial volumes with normal aging: is atrial enlargement inevitable?	aging	2002-11-06	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate left atrial volume and its changes with the phases (active and passive) of atrial filling, and to examine the effect of normal aging on these parameters and pulmonary vein (PV) flow patterns.    BACKGROUND: Atrial volume change with normal aging has not been adequately described. Pulmonary vein flow patterns have not been volumetrically evaluated in normal aging. Combining atrial volumes and PV flow patterns obtained using transthoracic echocardiography could estimate shifts in left atrial mechanical function with normal aging.    METHODS: A total of 92 healthy subjects, divided into two groups: Group Y (young <50 years) and Group O (old > or =50 years), were prospectively studied. Maximal (Vol(max)) and minimal (Vol(min)) left atrial volumes were measured using the biplane method of discs and by three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction using the cubic spline interpolation algorithm. The passive filling, conduit, and active em…
26780861	SIRT6, oxidative stress, and aging.	aging	2016-02-??	The role of oxidative stress in the aging process has been highly debated for decades and remains equivocal. A new study published in Cell Research reports a novel role for the aging-associated SIRT6 deacetylase in the control of oxidative homeostasis in human mesenchymal stem cells.
21185969	Dietary patterns and survival of older adults.	aging	2011-01-??	BACKGROUND: Recent research has linked overall dietary patterns to survival in older adults.    OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the dietary patterns of a cohort of older adults, and to explore associations of these dietary patterns with survival over a 10-year period. A secondary goal was to evaluate participants' quality of life and nutritional status according to their dietary patterns.    DESIGN: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study is a prospective cohort study of 3,075 older adults. In this study, all-cause mortality was assessed from baseline through Year 10. Food intake was estimated with a modified Block food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns of 2,582 participants with complete data were derived by cluster analysis.    RESULTS: Six dietary pattern clusters were identified, including a Healthy Foods cluster, characterized by higher intake of low-fat dairy products, fruit, whole grains, poultry, fish, and vegetables. Both the High-Fat…
26462844	Serum levels of cathepsin D, sirtuin1, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase are correlatively reduced in elderly healthy people.	aging	2016-08-??	AIM: Nowadays, cathepsins have been reported to be related to aging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between serum levels of cathepsin D (CTSD) and human aging.    METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed the serum levels of CTSD and its relation with levels of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, which were known having an important role in aging. This study recruited 90 healthy subjects (62 men and 28 women), which were subdivided into three groups with respect to age: young (about 19 years old, n = 30), middle-age (about 40 years old, n = 30), and aged (above 65 years old, n = 30). Altered serum levels of CTSD and SIRT1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and eNOS activity was assessed by the conversion of 14(C)-L-arginine to 14(C)-L-citrulline.    RESULTS: Elderly subjects had significantly lower CTSD, SIRT1, and eNOS than younger ones. Serum levels of CTSD were negatively correlated with age. There was a sta…
17767685	Oxidative stress is associated with greater mortality in older women living in the community.	aging	2007-09-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether oxidative stress, as implied by oxidative damage to proteins, is associated with greater mortality in older women living in the community.    DESIGN: Longitudinal.    SETTING: Women's Health and Aging Study I, Baltimore, Maryland.    PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred forty-six moderately to severely disabled women, aged 65 and older, with baseline measures of serum protein carbonyls.    MEASUREMENTS: Serum protein carbonyls, which consist of chemically stable aldehyde and ketone groups produced on protein side chains when they are oxidized, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.    RESULTS: During 5 years of follow-up, 202 (27.1%) participants died. Geometric mean serum protein carbonyls were 0.091 nmol/mg in women who died and 0.083 nmol/mg in those who survived (P=.02). Log(e) protein carbonyls (nmol/mg) were associated with greater risk of mortality (hazards rati…
16480974	Domain-general contributions to social reasoning: theory of mind and deontic reasoning re-explored.	aging	2007-02-??	Using older adults and dual-task interference, we examined performance on two social reasoning tasks: theory of mind (ToM) tasks and versions of the deontic selection task involving social contracts and hazardous conditions. In line with performance accounts of social reasoning, evidence from both aging and the dual-task method suggested that domain-general resources contribute to performance of these tasks. Specifically, older adults were impaired relative to younger adults on all types of social reasoning tasks tested; performance varied as a function of the demands these tasks placed on domain-general resources. Moreover, in younger adults, simultaneous performance of a working memory task interfered with younger adults' performance on both types of social reasoning tasks; here too, the magnitude of the interference effect varied with the processing demands of each task. Limits placed on social reasoning by executive functions contribute a great deal to performance, even in old age …
17914156	Signaling functions of free radicals superoxide &amp; nitric oxide under physiological &amp; pathological conditions.	aging	2007-09-??	Superoxide and nitric oxide are ubiquitous physiological free radicals that are responsible for many pathological disorders. Both radicals by themselves are relatively harmless but are the precursors of many toxic species such as peroxy and hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite. However, it has been shown now that both superoxide and nitric oxide are also able to perform important signaling functions in physiological and pathophysiological processes. Wrongly named "superoxide," the radical anion of dioxygen is not a super-oxidant but the strong super-nucleophile, an efficient catalyst of heterogenic nucleophilic reaction. Due to this, superoxide plays an important role in many enzymatic processes such as the phosphorylation and activation of numerous protein kinases. On the other hand, superoxide inhibits the activation of phosphatases, the enzymes catalyzed by dephosphorylation of protein kinases. We suggest that superoxide catalyzes these enzymatic processes as a re…
17451133	Keeping busy: a Yup'ik/Cup'ik perspective on health and aging.	aging	2007-02-??	OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of cultural beliefs about health and how they influence life choices and intervention is essential in forming health policy and health promotion programs to meet the growing needs of aging minority populations. This study explores cultural beliefs and practices of health and well-being of Yup'ik/Cup'ik women in two rural villages in southwestern Alaska.    STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory, descriptive qualitative study.    METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 15 mid-life and older women to address two key research questions: 1) How do Yup'ik/Cup'ik women define health and wellbeing; and 2) What environmental, social, and cultural factors contribute to healthy aging?    RESULTS: The women in this study define health aging within the framework of subsistence living-keeping busy, walking, eating subsistence foods, and respect for elders. These beliefs and practices promote a strong, active body and mind, vital components to healthy aging.    CONCLUSIONS: While many healt…
21255657	Relationships between cognitive function and frontal grey matter volumes and thickness in middle aged and early old-aged adults: the PATH Through Life Study.	aging	2011-04-01	The study examined the relationship of lateral frontal cortical volume and thickness with cognitive function in two samples of healthy middle aged (MA, 44-48 years old) and early old-age (OA, 64-68 years old) adults. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired in 400 MA and 397 OA adults from respective random community samples. Cortical volumes and thickness were measured with a surface-based segmentation procedure (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). Volumes of lateral frontal grey matter were found to be significantly lower for OA than MA. Structure-function relationships were investigated using path analyses. In OA, smaller lateral frontal volumes were associated with better episodic memory (EM) (p<0.012, B=-0.117), and Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDM) (p<0.031, B=-0.118) performance. Smaller frontal cortical thickness was also associated with better EM (p<0.01) and SDM (p<0.01) performance in OA. However, in MA greater cortical thickness was associated with better…
25810927	Combined cognitive-psychological-physical intervention induces reorganization of intrinsic functional brain architecture in older adults.	aging	2015-??-??	Mounting evidence suggests that enriched mental, physical, and socially stimulating activities are beneficial for counteracting age-related decreases in brain function and cognition in older adults. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate the functional plasticity of brain activity in response to a combined cognitive-psychological-physical intervention and investigated the contribution of the intervention-related brain changes to individual performance in healthy older adults. The intervention was composed of a 6-week program of combined activities including cognitive training, Tai Chi exercise, and group counseling. The results showed improved cognitive performance and reorganized regional homogeneity of spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the superior and middle temporal gyri, and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, in the participants who attended the intervention. Intriguingly, the intervention-induced c…
20434345	Effects of ankle fatigue on functional reflex activity during gait perturbations in young and elderly men.	aging	2010-05-??	There is growing evidence that aging and muscle fatigue result in impaired postural reflexes in humans. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effects of ankle fatigue on functional reflex activity (FRA) during gait perturbations in young and elderly men. Twenty-eight young (27.0+/-3.1 years, n=14) and old (67.2+/-3.7 years, n=14) healthy active men participated in this study. Fatigue of the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors was induced by isokinetic contractions. Pre and post-fatigue, subjects were tested for their ability to compensate for decelerating gait perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Latency, FRA of lower extremity muscles and angular velocity of the ankle joint complex were analysed by means of surface electromyography and goniometry. After the fatigue protocol, no significant main and interaction effects were detected for the parameter latency in m. tibialis anterior (TA). For both groups, a significant pre to post-test decrease in FRA in TA (p<.00…
16755139	Age-related reduction of systemic arterial compliance induces excessive myocardial oxygen consumption during sub-maximal exercise.	aging	2006-02-??	Reduction of systemic arterial compliance (SAC) with aging increases left ventricular afterload. The present study was designed to examine whether age-related reduction of SAC is related to excessive myocardial oxygen consumption during sub-maximal aerobic exercise. We studied elderly (60-69 years; n = 25) and senior (70-82 years; n = 25) subjects. We measured SAC immediately before the start of the ramp-fashion exercise (i.e., at the end of the 20 W warm-up exercise) and the double product (DP: systolic blood pressure x heart rate) during the ramp-fashion exercise (20-50 W). SAC was significantly lower in senior subjects (0.76 +/- 0.25 ml mmHg(-1) m(-2)) compared with elderly subjects (0.95 +/- 0.22 ml mmHg(-1) m(-2)). DP was higher in senior subjects (20 W: 14.3 +/- 3.1; 30 W: 15.9 +/- 4.2; 40 W: 17.7 +/- 4.9; 50 W: 20.6 +/- 5.6 [x 10(3) mmHg bpm]) than in elderly subjects (12.8 +/- 3.0, 14.0 +/- 3.5, 15.1 +/- 4.0, 17.1 +/- 4.3 [x 10(3) mmHg bpm]). In total subjects, SAC correlated s…
27683903	Dissociable Changes of Frontal and Parietal Cortices in Inherent Functional Flexibility across the Human Life Span.	aging	2016-??-28	UNLABELLED: Extensive evidence suggests that frontoparietal regions can dynamically update their pattern of functional connectivity, supporting cognitive control and adaptive implementation of task demands. However, it is largely unknown whether this flexibly functional reconfiguration is intrinsic and occurs even in the absence of overt tasks. Based on recent advances in dynamics of resting-state functional resonance imaging (fMRI), we propose a probabilistic framework in which dynamic reconfiguration of intrinsic functional connectivity between each brain region and others can be represented as a probability distribution. A complexity measurement (i.e., entropy) was used to quantify functional flexibility, which characterizes heterogeneous connectivity between a particular region and others over time. Following this framework, we identified both functionally flexible and specialized regions over the human life span (112 healthy subjects from 13 to 76 years old). Across brainwide regi…
20738287	Health consequences of reproductive aging: a commentary.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2010-08-??	This commentary discusses the intersection of human ovarian and somatic aging. It argues for re-contextualizing estrogen's role in and impact on ovarian aging and, more broadly, on women's health, considering in particular the importance of timing, dose, and the broader endocrine milieu. Distinguishing between current clinical needs and optimizing women's future options, the paper outlines an approach to broadening the research agenda to better understand the role of ovarian aging in supporting the metabolic demands of longevity. Three overarching issues important to consider explicitly as we pursue research on the health correlates of reproductive aging are discussed, including implications of a lifespan approach, population diversity, and selection bias.
21447408	Truncation, cross-linking and interaction of crystallins and intermediate filament proteins in the aging human lens.	aging	2011-05-??	The optical properties of the lens are dependent upon the integrity of proteins within the fiber cells. During aging, crystallins, the major intra-cellular structural proteins of the lens, aggregate and become water-insoluble. Modifications to crystallins and the lens intermediate filaments have been implicated in this phenomenon. In this study, we examined changes to, and interactions between, human lens crystallins and intermediate filament proteins in lenses from a variety of age groups (0-86years). Among the lens-specific intermediate filament proteins, filensin was extensively cleaved in all postnatal lenses, with truncated products of various sizes being found in both the lens cortical and nuclear extracts. Phakinin was also truncated and was not detected in the lens nucleus. The third major intermediate filament protein, vimentin, remained intact in lens cortical fiber cells across the age range except for an 86year lens, where a single ~49kDa breakdown product was observed. An …
25064038	Mechanical, hormonal, and hypertrophic adaptations to 10 weeks of eccentric and stretch-shortening cycle exercise training in old males.	aging	2014-10-??	The growth promoting effects of eccentric (ECC) contractions are well documented but it is unknown if the rate of stretch per se plays a role in such muscular responses in healthy aging human skeletal muscle. We tested the hypothesis that exercise training of the quadriceps muscle with low rate ECC and high rate ECC contractions in the form of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) but at equal total mechanical work would produce rate-specific adaptations in healthy old males age 60-70. Both training programs produced similar improvements in maximal voluntary isometric (6%) and ECC torque (23%) and stretch-shortening cycle function (reduced contraction duration [24%] and enhanced elastic energy storage [12%]) (p<0.05). The rate of torque development increased 30% only after SSC exercise (p<0.05). Resting testosterone and cortisol levels were unchanged but after each program the acute exercise-induced cortisol levels were 12-15% lower (p<0.05). Both programs increased quadriceps size 2.5% (p<…
17288748	Age-related changes in cerebral hemodynamics and their correlations with cardiac autonomic functions.	aging	2006-12-??	OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the correlations between cerebral hemodynamics and cardiac autonomic functions in aging process using transfer function techniques.    METHODS: Arterial blood pressure (ABP), middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAFV) detected by transcranial Doppler sonography and electrocardiogram were recorded simultaneously in 20 young (27.5 +/- 0.9 years) and 20 middle-old-aged (54.3 +/- 1.5 years) healthy volunteers. Variability of ABP, MCAFV and heart rate (HR) were diffracted into very low (VLF, 0.016-0.04 Hz), low (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) components. Cerebral vasomotor reserve was quantified by specific ABP-MCAFV transfer function measurements.    RESULTS: The young group had significantly higher LF transfer phase and HF transfer magnitudes of ABP-MCAFV transfer function; higher HF powers of HR variability; and higher baroreflex sensitivity than those of the middle-old-aged group. LF phase and HF magnitude of ABP-…
10071714	Polygraphic sleep criteria as predictors of successful aging: an exploratory longitudinal study.	aging	1999-02-15	BACKGROUND: A cohort of 57 elderly healthy volunteers (34 male, 23 female) was studied in a sleep laboratory on four consecutive nights when their average age was 63.5 +/- 3.7 years. Thirty subjects (20 male, 10 female) were assessed 14 years later; 21 had either died in the meantime or were very ill, and 6 did not participate for other reasons.    METHODS: Two operationalizations of successful aging were applied: survival in relatively good health (30 survivors vs. 21 nonsurvivors), and cognitive competence as assessed in the survivors by means of tests of cognitive function.    RESULTS: Whereas none of the sleep characteristics determined at baseline distinguished the survivors from the nonsurvivors, several parameters [REM (rapid eye movement) sleep latency, REM density, and NREM (non-REM) shifts] were significantly correlated with one or more measures of cognitive functioning at follow-up. These polygraphic sleep parameters also distinguished a subgroup of cognitively fully compete…
21124009	Elder abuse and mortality: the role of psychological and social wellbeing.	aging	2011-??-??	BACKGROUND: Elder abuse is a pervasive human right and public health issue.    OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the mortality associated with elder abuse across levels of psychological and social factors.    METHODS: The Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) is a prospective population-based cohort study that began in 1993. A subset of these participants enrolled between 1993 and 2005 had elder abuse reported to social services agencies (n = 113). Mortality was ascertained during follow-up and with the National Death Index. Psychosocial factors (depression, social network and social engagement) were assessed during the CHAP interview. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the mortality of elder abuse across levels of psychosocial factors using time-varying covariate analyses.    RESULTS: The median follow-up time for the cohort (n = 7,841) was 7.6 years (interquartile range 3.8-12.4 years). In multivariate analyses, those with highest (hazard ratio (HR) 2.60, 95% CI 1.58-…
26419465	Dynamic alteration of serum testosterone with aging: a cross-sectional study from Shanghai, China.	aging	2015-09-30	BACKGROUND: Level of the testosterone in a man's life span is very important. Studies on the serum testosterone concentrations in different age groups of healthy men were controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate dynamic changes of serum reproductive hormones with aging in healthy Chinese male and to compare its correlation with age.    METHODS: Total of 1,093 healthy Chinese men from Shanghai aged from 20 to 87  years old was enrolled in the study. Concentrations of serum total testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were quantified by EIA. Testosterone secretion index (TSI) and free testosterone index (FTI) were then calculated. Data were analyzed by SPSS program. Non-parametric tests and univariate linear regression analyses were used.    RESULTS: The 1,039 male participants were grouped into 12 groups by 5-year apart for each group. Significant differences in T, LH, SHBG, FTI and TSI were found between the 12 different age gr…
15611597	Age-related circadian variations of cardiac and respiratory components of the carotid baroreflex in humans.	aging	2004-09-??	Our previous studies indicated the presence of a respiratory effector of carotid baroreceptor activation: the respiratory resistance. A brief decrease in respiratory resistance was observed in response to carotid baroreceptor activation. In the course of aging we found a decrease in the heart response to carotid baroreceptor activation and disappearance of the respiratory response. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the circadian variations of baroreflex sensitivity, as related to aging, are attributable to changes in cardiovascular and respiratory control in the elderly. We evaluated the cardiac responses and the reflex changes of the respiratory resistance to carotid baroreceptor activation every two hours in: 12 healthy male subjects aged 20-38 years, 6 male subjects aged 20-38 years and 6 male subjects aged 70-80 years. Two neck-chambers were used to produce a brief suction, applied to carotid sinus regions, activating the carotid baroreceptor. We found that the …
26574799	MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry Spatially Maps Age-Related Deamidation and Truncation of Human Lens Aquaporin-0.	aging	2015-11-??	PURPOSE: To spatially map human lens Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) protein modifications, including lipidation, truncation, and deamidation, from birth through middle age using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS).    METHODS: Human lens sections were water-washed to facilitate detection of membrane protein AQP0. We acquired MALDI images from eight human lenses ranging in age from 2 months to 63 years. In situ tryptic digestion was used to generate peptides of AQP0 and peptide images were acquired on a 15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Peptide extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and database searched to identify peptides observed in MALDI imaging experiments.    RESULTS: Unmodified, truncated, and fatty acid-acylated forms of AQP0 were detected in protein imaging experiments. Full-length AQP0 was fatty acid acylated in the core and cortex of young (2- and 4-month) …
10411010	Dynamic paradigms for human mortality and aging.	longevity, aging	1999-06-??	Hazard models are often applied to mortality data of humans and other species so that the parameter estimates made for those models can be used to make inferences about the biology, and comparative biology, of aging processes. Enough longitudinal data on physiological and functional changes in humans now exist to know that the age trajectory of the physiological state of individuals is multidimensional, stochastic, and plastic. Thus, to fully assess the biological significance of existing longitudinal data on human aging and mortality processes, multivariate stochastic process models must be developed that are biologically detailed and valid. This requires assessing genetic mechanisms controlling human longevity and rates of aging, developing models of how those traits may have evolved, and developing statistical methods for identifying gene environment interactions. This article examines the theoretical basis for such models and the biological rationale of their parametric structure. …
16293445	Wavelet transform shows age-related changes of heart rate variability within independent frequency components.	aging	2005-12-30	Reduction in overall heart rate variability (HRV) associated with aging is determined by a decreased amplitude of heart rate oscillations at all frequency levels, including high frequency (HF) oscillations attributed to respiratory sinus arrhythmia, low frequency (LF) oscillations attributed to Meyer waves and very low frequency (VLF) oscillations of an uncertain origin, presumably linked among others to thermoregulation. However, no studies were conducted to determine whether heart rate oscillations at independent frequency levels show themselves reduced HRV. Wavelet transform was applied to filter specific frequency components of HRV in a sample of younger (21-34 years old) and older (68-85 years old) healthy subjects. HRV indexes were measured within HF, LF and VLF components. The standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD) were used as conventional linear time-domain measures. Sample entropy (S…
11230783	N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine alters insulin-mediated calf blood flow but not glucose disposal in the elderly.	aging	2001-03-??	It has been proposed that an important component of glucose disposal is insulin-mediated vasodilation via a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. Normal aging is characterized by a resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal and deficient endothelial NO production. Impairment of insulin-mediated vasodilation could contribute to this insulin resistance. We tested the hypothesis that the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) would decrease insulin-mediated calf vasodilation and whole-body glucose disposal in young subjects but would have little or no effect in the elderly. Experiments were performed on healthy young (n = 10) and old (n = 10) subjects on 2 study days. Insulin was infused for 4 hours at 40 mU/m(2)/min (young) and 34 mU/m(2)/min (old) during both studies, and L-NMMA (0.1 mg/kg/min) was coinfused during the last 2 hours of insulin on one of these sessions. Calf blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, and calf vascular conductance…
23433651	Age-related changes in liver, kidney, and spleen stiffness in healthy children measured with acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.	aging	2013-06-??	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and age-related changes of shear wave velocity (SWV) in normal livers, kidneys, and spleens of children using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy pediatric volunteers prospectively underwent abdominal ultrasonography and ARFI. The subjects were divided into three groups according to age: group 1: <5 years old; group 2: 5-10 years old; and group 3: >10 years old. The SWV was measured using a 4-9 MHz linear probe for group 1 and a 1-4 MHz convex probe for groups 2 and 3. Three valid SWV measurements were acquired for each organ.    RESULTS: Two hundred and two children (92 male, 110 female) with an average age of 8.1 years (± 4.7) were included in this study and had a successful measurement rate of 97% (196/202). The mean SWVs were 1.12 m/s for the liver, 2.19 m/s for the right kidney, 2.33 m/s for the left kidney, and 2.25 m/s for the spleen. The SWVs for the right and left kidneys, and the spleen sho…
19285548	The absence of a mitochondrial genome in rho0 yeast cells extends lifespan independently of retrograde regulation.	longevity, lifespan	????-??-??	The absence of mtDNA in rho0 yeast cells affects both respiration and mitochondrial-nuclear communication (e.g., retrograde regulation, intergenomic signaling, or pleiotropic drug resistance). Previously, it has been reported that some rho0 strains have increased replicative lifespans, attributable to the lack of respiration and retrograde regulation. Here, we have been able to confirm that rho0 cells exhibit increased replicative lifespans but have found that this is not associated with the lack of respiration or reduced oxidative stress but instead, is related to the lack of mtDNA per se in rho0 cells. Also, we find no correlation between the strength of retrograde regulation and lifespan. Furthermore, we find that pdr3- or rtg2- mutations are not responsible for lifespan extension in rho0 cells, ruling out a specific role for PDR3-pleiotropic drug resistance or RGT2-retrograde regulation pathways in the extended lifespans of rho0 cells. Surprisingly, Rtg3p, which acts downstream of …
299555	The changing pattern of whole body protein metabolism in aging humans.	aging	1978-09-??	Dynamic aspects of whole body protein (nitrogen) metabolism were explored in healthy young adults and elderly men and women. Measurements were made of the rate of whole body protein breakdown, with the aid of 15N-glycine, and the rate of muscle protein breakdown, as estimated from urinary N tau-methylhistidine excretion. The results also were evaluated in relation to obligatory (endogenous) urinary nitrogen losses, previously determined in this laboratory for the two age groups. Rates of whole body and muscle protein breakdown, per unit body weight, were lower in elderly subjects than in young adults. Muscle accounted for a mean of 27% of whole body protein breakdown in young adults and 20% or less (p less than 0.01) in elderly subjects. Daily obligatory N loss was positively correlated (p less than 0.01) with whole body protein breakdown. It was calculated that muscle contributed less to the obligatory N output in elderly subjects than in young adults. These results indicate a change …
7966476	Aging exaggerates glucose intolerance following injury.	aging	1994-11-??	Hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance are characteristic of both the metabolic responses to injury and normal aging. To evaluate the interaction of such changes we conducted hyperglycemic glucose clamp studies (2-hour) in previously healthy young (20 +/- 4 years, Mean +/- SD) and older (73 +/- 9 years) trauma patients and volunteers (23 +/- 1 and 68 +/- 5 years), determining whole-body glucose disposal and insulin responses to hyperglycemia. Injury Severity Scores were similar in the young and older patient groups (range, 17-30). Plasma glucose levels were greater in patients than volunteers in both the basal and hyperglycemic periods. Basal serum insulin and C-peptide levels were similar among groups, but during hyperglycemia both were markedly higher in young patients than older (and both volunteer groups). Whole-body disposal of exogenous glucose was substantially lower in patients than volunteers and in the older groups. Aging has a major impact on postinjury metabolism, being asso…
15753170	Effects of vitamin E depletion/repletion on biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy aging.	aging	2004-12-??	The effects on ex vivo LDL resistance to oxidation and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress in response to 3-month dietary vitamin E restriction to 25% of recommended intake and 2-month unrestricted dietary intake and supplementation with 800 IU/d were studied in 100 healthy, nonsmoking 20-75-year-old volunteers. Significant changes in vitamin E status were associated with decreases and increases, respectively, in LDL resistance to oxidation in the depletion and supplementation period and with decreases in lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA modification in the supplementation period. Healthy aging was not associated with enhanced susceptibility to oxidation in the depletion period.
19305496	Age-related cellular copper dynamics in the fungal ageing model Podospora anserina and in ageing human fibroblasts.	lifespan	2009-??-??	In previous investigations an impact of cellular copper homeostasis on ageing of the ascomycete Podospora anserina has been demonstrated. Here we provide new data indicating that mitochondria play a major role in this process. Determination of copper in the cytosolic fraction using total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis and eGfp reporter gene studies indicate an age-related increase of cytosolic copper levels. We show that components of the mitochondrial matrix (i.e. eGFP targeted to mitochondria) become released from the organelle during ageing. Decreasing the accessibility of mitochondrial copper in P. anserina via targeting a copper metallothionein to the mitochondrial matrix was found to result in a switch from a copper-dependent cytochrome-c oxidase to a copper-independent alternative oxidase type of respiration and results in lifespan extension. In addition, we demonstrate that increased copper concentrations in the culture medium lead to the appearance of sene…
28391885	Relationship between changes in polyunsaturated fatty acids and aging-related arterial stiffness in overweight subjects 50 years or older over a 3-year period.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Although aging-related elastic arterial stiffness is an independent indicator of cardiovascular risk, the roles of polyunsaturated fatty acids in this condition remain uncertain.    OBJECTIVE: This prospective study examined the relationships of aging, persist overweight and plasma fatty acids with arterial stiffening over 3 years.    METHODS: We divided a cohort of 179 healthy, nonhypertensive subjects (aged ≥50 years) into 2 groups: a normal-weight group (18.5 kg/m ≤ body mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m, n = 103) and an overweight group (25 kg/m ≤ BMI< 30 kg/m, n = 76). Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) and plasma fatty acids were measured at baseline and after 3 years.    RESULTS: After 3 years, the overweight group showed greater increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-Insulin resistance index and ba-PWV values (P = .009) than the normal-weight group. In addition, greater reductions in eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:3, …
11890579	Muscle size responses to strength training in young and older men and women.	aging	2001-11-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine the possible influences of age and gender on muscle volume responses to strength training (ST).    DESIGN: Prospective intervention study.    SETTING: University of Maryland Exercise Science and Wellness Research Laboratories.    PARTICIPANTS: Eight young men (age 20-30 years), six young women (age 20-30 years), nine older men (age 65-75 years), and ten older women (age 65-75 years).    INTERVENTION: A 6-month whole-body ST program that exercised all major muscle groups of the upper and lower body 3 days/week.    MEASUREMENTS: Thigh and quadriceps muscle volumes and mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging before and after the ST program.    RESULTS: Thigh and quadriceps muscle volume increased significantly in all age and gender groups as a result of ST (P < .001), with no significant differences between the groups. Modest correlations were observed between both the change in quadriceps versus the change in total th…
15288698	Basal cerebral blood flow is dependent on the nitric oxide pathway in elderly but not in young healthy men.	aging	2004-08-??	OBJECTIVE: Brain perfusion is tightly regulated over a wide range of blood pressures by local regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Ageing is associated with impaired CBF and impaired nitric oxide mediated vasodilator responses. The role of nitric oxide in the regulation of basal CBF in young and older subjects was investigated, using the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NMMA as pharmacological tool.    METHODS: We used a gradient echo phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique to investigate the role of nitric oxide in the regulation of cerebral blood flow in young (25+/-7.1 years; n=8) and old (78+/-6.6 years; n=7) volunteers. The study was performed in a double-blinded fashion and consisted of two study days. On one day the effects of the intravenously infused L-NMMA on CBF and blood pressure was measured and on the other day the effects of a matching placebo.    RESULTS: Basal CBF was significantly lower in old compared to young subjects (590+/-20 vs 704+/-20 ml/min), …
19954304	Aging-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase response to dietary supplementation: the French paradox revisited.	aging	????-??-??	Aging-related cell-surface NADH oxidase (arNOX)-specific activities increase with age between age 30 and ages 50-65. The protein is shed and circulates. Activity correlates with a number of aging-related disorders including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation as a precondition to atherosclerosis as well as oxidation of collagen and elastin as a major contributor to skin aging. arNOX inhibitors formulated for sustained release are capable of maintaining circulating arNOX at low levels with regular use as food supplements formulated with natural compounds. Among the best sources are certain culinary seasonings, all of which are ingredients used extensively in the French kitchen. Their regular use may contribute to an understanding of the nutritional basis for the French Paradox.
24366906	Stability and plasticity of auditory brainstem function across the lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2015-06-??	The human auditory brainstem is thought to undergo rapid developmental changes early in life until age ∼2 followed by prolonged stability until aging-related changes emerge. However, earlier work on brainstem development was limited by sparse sampling across the lifespan and/or averaging across children and adults. Using a larger dataset than past investigations, we aimed to trace more subtle variations in auditory brainstem function that occur normally from infancy into the eighth decade of life. To do so, we recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to a click stimulus and a speech syllable (da) in 586 normal-hearing healthy individuals. Although each set of ABR measures (latency, frequency encoding, response consistency, nonstimulus activity) has a distinct developmental profile, across all measures developmental changes were found to continue well past age 2. In addition to an elongated developmental trajectory and evidence for multiple auditory developmental processes, we revea…
15961613	Lack of age-related decreases in basal whole leg blood flow in resistance-trained men.	aging	2005-10-??	Reductions in basal leg blood flow have been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and functional impairment in humans. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in basal whole leg blood flow with age are either absent or attenuated in those who perform regular strength training. A total of 104 normotensive men aged 20-34 yr (young) and 35-65 yr (middle aged), who were either sedentary or resistance trained, were studied. Mean and diastolic blood pressures were higher (P < 0.05-0.001) in the middle-aged compared with the young men, but there were no significant differences between the sedentary and resistance-trained groups. In the sedentary group, basal whole leg blood flow (duplex Doppler ultrasound) and vascular conductance were lower ( approximately 30 and approximately 38%, respectively; P < 0.01) in the middle-aged compared with the young men. There were no such age-related differences in the resistance-trained group. In the young men, basal whole leg blood flow and…
15457450	Age dependency of cartilage magnetic resonance imaging T2 relaxation times in asymptomatic women.	aging	2004-09-??	OBJECTIVE: Because the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) transverse relaxation time (T2) of cartilage is sensitive to organization of collagen fibers in the cartilage, it may be a noninvasive image marker for senescent changes in cartilage collagen and early cartilage degeneration. The purpose of this study was to determine age-dependent differences in cartilage T2 values in healthy asymptomatic women.    METHODS: Quantitative T2 maps of patellar cartilage from 30 asymptomatic women ages 22-86 years were obtained using a 3.0T MRI scanner. The study population was stratified by age into 4 cohorts: 18-30, 31-45, 46-65, and 66-86 years. Spatial differences in cartilage T2 were determined as a function of normalized distance from bone. Older groups were compared with the 18-30-year-old group to determine the effects of age on cartilage T2 values. Regions were considered statistically significantly different if the mean T2 values between groups differed at P < 0.05.    RESULTS: Mean cartilag…
18231745	Assessment of age-related changes in left ventricular twist by two-dimensional ultrasound speckle tracking imaging.	aging	2007-12-??	To assess the normal value of left ventricular twist (LVtw) and examine the changes with normal aging by 2-dimensional ultrasound speckle-tracking imaging (STI), 121 healthy volunteers were divided into three age groups: a youth group (19-45 y old), a middle-age group (46-64 y old) and an old-age group (> or = 65 y old). Basal and apical short-axis images of left ventricular were acquired to analyse LV rotation (LVrot) and LVrot velocity. LVtw and LVtw velocity was defined as apical LVrot and LVrot velocity relative to the base. Peak twist (Ptw), twist at aortic valve closure (AVCtw), twist at mitral valve opening (MVOtw), untwisting rate (UntwR), half time of untwisting (HTU), peak twist velocity (PTV), time to peak twist velocity (TPTV), peak untwisting velocity (PUV), time to peak untwisting velocity (TPUV) were separately measured. The results showed that the normal LV performs a wringing motion with a clockwise rotation at the base and a counterclock-wise rotation at the apex (as …
3659579	Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in the elderly.	aging	1987-??-??	The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin, administered orally as a 250-mg tablet were compared in 10 young (age 20-30 years) and 10 elderly (age 60-73 years) healthy volunteers. The time to peak serum concentrations was about 80 min in both age groups, although the maximum concentration attained was significantly greater in the old (1.7 mg/l) than the young (1.2 mg/l). Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, corrected for body weight, was on average 48% greater in the elderly, but the mean terminal elimination half-life was not significantly different, averaging 4.3 h in the old and 3.7 h in the young. Overall 24-hour urinary recovery in both age groups was comparable. The differences may be explained by a reduced volume of distribution of ciprofloxacin in old age and do not suggest a general need for significant dose alteration in the elderly.
27333937	Quantitative T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> MRI signal characteristics in the human brain: different patterns of MR contrasts in normal ageing.	aging	2016-12-??	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine age-dependent changes in both T-weighted and T-weighted image contrasts and spin-echo T relaxation time in the human brain during healthy ageing.    METHODS: A total of 37 participants between the ages of 49 and 87 years old were scanned with a 3 Tesla system, using T-weighted, T weighted and quantitative spin-echo T imaging. Contrast between image intensities and T values was calculated for various regions, including between individual hippocampal subfields.    RESULTS: The T contrast-to-noise (CNR) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (GWR) did not change in the hippocampus, but it declined in the cingulate cortex with age. In contrast, T CNR and GWR declined in both brain regions. T relaxation time was almost constant in gray matter and most (but not all) hippocampal subfields, but increased substantially in white matter, pointing to an age effect on water relaxation in white matter.    CONCLUSIONS: Changes in T and T MR charact…
29446966	When divided attention fails to enhance memory encoding: The attentional boost effect is eliminated in young-old adults.	aging	2018-??-??	In the Attentional Boost Effect (ABE), images or words presented with to-be-responded target squares are later recognized more accurately than images or words presented with to-be-ignored distractor squares. Surprisingly, previous studies investigating the ABE have always examined young participants: thus, the question of whether this memory facilitation can be also observed in older adults has never been tested. The present study sought to fill this gap by examining whether healthy aging modulated the size of the ABE in 4 experiments in which the nature of the background stimuli (images vs. words), the length of the encoding trials (500 vs. 1,000 ms), and the type of instructions given to participants (incidental vs. intentional) were varied. In all cases, the results showed that the ABE was robust and significant in younger adults, whereas it was completely abolished in older adults.

21903342	Aging as a consequence of intracellular water volume and density.	aging	2011-12-??	Aging is the result of a gradual failure of physiological and/or biochemical pathways that culminates with the death of the organism. Until now, the causative factors of aging are elusive, despite the increasing number of theories that try to explain how aging initiates. Interestingly, aging cells show an increase in intracellular water volume, but this fact is barely explored in aging studies. All cells have a crowded cytoplasm, where the high concentration and proximity of macromolecules create an environment that excludes many small molecules, including water. In this crowded environment, water can be found in two states termed low density water (LDW), which shows low reactivity and has an ice-like structure, and high density water (HDW) that has a disorganized structure and is highly reactive. LDW predominates in a macromolecular crowded environment, while HDW is found only in microenvironments within cytoplasm. In this sense, we hypothesized that the failure in the water homeostas…
23135355	Parental imprinting regulates insulin-like growth factor signaling: a Rosetta Stone for understanding the biology of pluripotent stem cells, aging and cancerogenesis.	aging	2013-04-??	In recent years, solid evidence has accumulated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and 2 (IGF-2) regulate many biological processes in normal and malignant cells. Recently, more light has been shed on the epigenetic mechanisms regulating expression of genes involved in IGF signaling (IFS) and it has become evident that these mechanisms are crucial for initiation of embryogenesis, maintaining the quiescence of pluripotent stem cells deposited in adult tissues (for example, very-small embryonic-like stem cells), the aging process, and the malignant transformation of cells. The expression of several genes involved in IFS is regulated at the epigenetic level by imprinting/methylation within differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which regulate their expression from paternal or maternal chromosomes. The most important role in the regulation of IFS gene expression is played by the Igf-2-H19 locus, which encodes the autocrine/paracrine mitogen IGF-2 and the H19 gene, which gives ris…
11136929	Effects of age on brain activation during auditory-cued thumb-to-index opposition: A positron emission tomography study.	aging	2001-01-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Available data indicate a decline in fine finger movements with aging, suggesting changes in central motor processes. Thus far no functional neuroimaging study has assessed the effect of age on activation patterns during finger movement.    METHODS: We used high-resolution perfusion positron emission tomography to study 2 groups of 7 healthy right-handed subjects each: a young group (mean age, 24 years) and an old group (mean age, 60 years). The task was a thumb-to-index tapping, auditory-cued at 1. 26 Hz with a metronome, with either the right or the left hand. The control condition was a resting state with the metronome on.    RESULTS: Significant differences between old and young subjects were found, suggesting significant overactivation in older subjects affecting the superior frontal cortex (premotor-prefrontal junction) ipsilateral to the moving fingers, as if the execution of this apparently simple motor task was judged more complex by the aged brain. Sim…
2055659	Growing old in the cradle: old age and immortality among the kings of ancient Assyria.	longevity	1991-??-??	The desire for a long and healthy life was expressed often by Assyrian kings in their extant public texts from the 14th through the 7th centuries BC. But advanced old age, whether for monarchs or commoners, was not achieved very often in the ancient world. Consequently, Assyrian royal inscriptions frequently reflect concern for another kind of longevity--an immortality achieved by having one's works and one's name preserved and remembered by posterity. Almost every dedicatory inscription associated with public works--palaces, temples, etc.--expressed the importance of these kings' participation in what this writer terms a "family cult." The latter constituted a sense of continuity from father to son to grandson, and so on, which depended upon each new generation to preserve and/or restore the works and the "names" of their predecessors. If the Assyrian kings each did their job as "Curator" or "Steward" of the family's heritage, they expressed the hope that they would not be forgotten--…
15275907	Age differences in neural correlates of route encoding and route recognition.	aging	2004-08-??	Spatial memory deficits are core features of aging-related changes in cognitive abilities. The neural correlates of these deficits are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of age-related differences in spatial memory by functional MRI using a navigational memory task with route encoding and route recognition conditions. We investigated 20 healthy young (18-29 years old) and 20 healthy old adults (53-78 years old) in a random effects analysis. Old subjects showed slightly poorer performance than young subjects. Compared to the control condition, route encoding and route recognition showed activation of the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams and the frontal eye fields in both groups of subjects. Compared to old adults, young subjects showed during route encoding stronger activations in the dorsal and the ventral visual processing stream (supramarginal gyrus and posterior fusiform/parahippocampal areas). In addition, young subjects show…
2735673	Protein and amino acid requirements of the elderly.	aging	1989-??-??	This paper has reviewed changes in body composition and protein metabolism that are associated with aging. Body protein mass decreases. Rates of both muscle and whole-body protein turnover/kg body weight decrease, and the percentage of turnover contributed by muscle to whole-body turnover decreases with age. Total plasma proteins, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and ceruloplasmin levels decline with age, and, in the case of albumin levels, the decline continues when young-old are compared with old-old. Protein requirement of the elderly appears to have been underestimated by the factorial method. Nitrogen balance studies indicate a minimum of 0.7 g protein/kg/day in one study. Several studies show 0.8 g, whereas other studies show negative nitrogen balance at this level. The recommended protein intake is 1 g protein/kg/day, and 12-14% of total calories should be provided by protein. The few nitrogen balance studies that attempted to determine essential amino acid requirements are limi…
6841562	Loss of circadian rhythmicity in blood testosterone levels with aging in normal men.	aging	1983-06-??	Previous studies concerning the relationship of serum testosterone levels to aging in normal men have yielded apparently inconsistent results. Studies performing blood sampling in the morning have often shown an age-related decrease in testosterone levels, while those using afternoon samples have failed to show such a decrease. These results suggested to us the possibility that the circadian rhythm in serum testosterone levels might be altered with normal aging in men. Hourly blood samples were obtained for 24 h from 1 young (mean age, 52.2 yr) and 12 old (mean age, 17 yr) healthy men. Total testosterone levels were measured by RIA. The circadian rhythm in serum testosterone levels found in normal young men was markedly attenuated or absent in healthy elderly men; the early morning rise in testosterone levels characteristic of young men was not present in old age. Mean testosterone levels for the entire 24-h day were lower in healthy old men than in young men. These results demonstrate…
15642332	Identification and functional clustering of global gene expression differences between age-related cataract and clear human lenses and aged human lenses.	aging	2004-12-??	We have examined the gene expression profiles of young, old and cataractous human lenses in order to differentiate those gene expression changes specific for cataract from those also associated with lens aging. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis and clustered according to their known functions. Four hundred and twelve transcripts that are increased and 919 transcripts that are decreased were identified at the 2-fold or greater level between epithelia isolated from cataract relative to clear lenses while 182 transcripts that are increased and 547 transcripts that are decreased were identified at the 2-fold or greater level between young and old lens epithelia. Comparison of the cataract gene expression changes with those detected in lens aging revealed that only 3 transcripts exhibited similar trends in gene expression. These data suggest that cataract- and age-specific changes in gene expression do not overlap and provide evidenc…
30518050	Walnut Consumption for Two Years and Leukocyte Telomere Attrition in Mediterranean Elders: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.	aging	2018-12-04	Randomized controlled trials on diet and shortening of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) mostly focus on marine-derived -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Walnuts are a sustainable source of -3 PUFA. We investigated whether inclusion of walnuts (15% of energy) in the diet for 2 years would maintain LTL in cognitively healthy elders (63⁻79 years old) compared to a control group (habitual diet, abstaining from walnuts). This opportunistic sub-study was conducted within the Walnuts and Healthy Aging study, a dual-centre (Barcelona, Spain and Loma Linda University, California) parallel trial. A sub-set of the Barcelona site participants were randomly assigned to the walnut ( = 80) or control group ( = 69). We assessed LTL at baseline and at 2 years and we conducted repeated-measures ANCOVA with 2 factors: time (baseline, 2 years) and group (control, walnut) and their interaction. Adjusted means (95% confidence interval) of LTL (in kb) in controls were 7.360 (7.084,7.636) at baseline and …
6383857	The endopeptidase-resistant protein fraction from human cataractous lenses.	aging	1984-07-??	With aging and cataract formation, modifications in absorption and fluorescence of the human lens proteins are observed. These changes have been investigated by the examination of the endopeptidase-resistant fraction isolated from human cataractous lenses. This fraction is highly enriched in atypical fluorescence and absorption (i.e. not attributable to tryptophan, tyrosine or phenylalanine). It has a molecular weight of approximately 3000, is enriched in acidic amino acids and has only a 280 nm shoulder in its u.v. spectrum. The material does not contain detectable levels of malondialdehyde or N-formylkynurenine. Upon acid hydrolysis the fluorescence and u.v. spectra remain unchanged with only a minor degree of cleavage observed. Structural studies on some of the cleavage products indicated the presence of oxindolyl alanine and kynurenine. These compounds could result from photo-oxidation of tryptophan.
20452582	Cerebral hemodynamic lateralization during memory tasks as assessed by functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) sonography: effects of gender and healthy aging.	aging	2011-06-??	INTRODUCTION: Previous neuropsychological, lesional and functional imaging studies deal with the lateralization of memory processes, suggesting that they could be determined by the stage of processing (encoding vs retrieval) or by content (verbal vs non-verbal stimuli). The aims of the present study were: 1) to investigate if tasks that can be carried out using different strategies depending on the verbalizability of the material induce a lateralization of the mean cerebral blood flow velocity (mCBFV) in the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs), as monitored by a functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD); 2) to evaluate if these patterns of cerebral activation differ in relation to age, gender and task performance.    METHOD: Using TCD bilateral monitoring, we recorded mCBFV variations in 35 male and 35 female healthy, right-handed volunteers, classified as "young" (age range 21-40 years, n=35) or "old"(age range 41-60 years, n=35), performing four different cognitive tasks: encoding and recog…
21273913	Effects of aging and training status on ventilatory response during incremental cycling exercise.	aging	2011-05-??	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of aging and training status on ventilatory response during incremental cycling exercise. Eight young (24 ± 5 years) and 8 older (64 ± 3 years) competitive cyclists together with 8 young (27 ± 4 years) and 8 older (63 ± 2 years) untrained individuals underwent a continuous incremental cycling test to exhaustion to determine ventilatory threshold (VT), respiratory compensation point (RCP), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max). In addition, the isocapnic buffering (IB) phase was calculated together with the hypocapnic hyperventilation. Ventilatory threshold occurred at similar relative exercise intensities in all groups, whereas RCP was recorded at higher intensities in young and older cyclists compared to the untrained subjects. The IB phase, reported as the difference between VT and RCP and expressed either in absolute (ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹ VO₂) or in relative terms, was greater (p < 0.01) in both young and older trained cyclists than in untrained…
16253402	Insulin regulates protein synthesis rate in leukocytes from young and elderly healthy humans.	aging	2005-12-??	Immune response is dependent on synthesis and secretion of various proteins. Hence, in vivo determination of protein synthesis rate in leukocytes may reflect the functional activity of these cells under conditions of immune deficiency such as aging. Because (i) insulin stimulates protein turnover in various tissues and (ii) elderly people often suffer from a decrease in insulin sensitivity, we sought to determine the effect of physiological hyperinsulinemia (0.7mU/kg fat free mass/min) on protein synthesis rate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from 8 adult (24+/-6yr) and 9 elderly (69+/-4yr) healthy subjects under strict euglycemia (0.9g/l). The body mass index was significantly higher in elderly volunteers compared to the younger ones (P<0.05) whereas insulin sensitivity was lower as shown by either the M value (P<0.05) or the glucose disposal rate (GDR)/insulinemia ratio (P<0.05). The density of the insulin receptor at PBMCs and P…
15974472	A fMRI study of age-related differential cortical patterns during cued motor movement.	aging	2005-??-??	Healthy adults of three age groups (young, middle-age and older) were cued by a multimedia projector to perform a series of simple (making a fist, opening/closing of the mouth) and complex (opposition of index finger and thumb, chewing gum) motor tasks while being scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results showed that in unilateral hand movements, the premotor/motor cortex in the contralateral hemisphere was most strongly activated. Supplementary motor cortex involvement was usually present in the young and not in the old, except in precision movement when supplementary motor cortex was also involved in the old. For movements of the face (chewing, opening and closing of mouth), the prefrontal cortex was activated in the old age group but finger and hand movements never activated the prefrontal cortex in any age. Furthermore, areas like insula and cingulate gyrus might be activated in motor tasks. We conclude that different motor activities triggered diverse activatio…
10078317	The relationship of peripheral motor nerve conduction velocity to age-associated loss of grip strength.	aging	1998-12-??	Age-associated loss of muscle strength is attributed to decreasing muscle mass. Both strength and mass are dependent on peripheral innervation. However, the association between nerve function and age-associated strength loss has not been studied directly. The median nerve contribution to grip strength was estimated using nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Grip strength and NCV were measured in 197 male participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (age 59.0 +/- 13.9 years). Multiple regression and path analyses were used separately to examine the association between median NCV and grip strength. Grip strength showed a negative quadratic relationship with increasing age (r2 = 0.32, p < 0.001) with a major change in slope occurring after 64.7 years of age. Median NCV (r2 = 0.14, p < 0.001) declined linearly with age. Median NCV significantly contributed to grip strength (p < 0.001) while controlling for forearm muscle mass (forearm circumference), self-reported 24-hour caloric …
8172735	Phase-contrast cine MR imaging of normal aqueductal CSF flow. Effect of aging and relation to CSF void on modulus MR.	aging	1994-03-??	Cine phase-contrast MR imaging was used to study pulsatile CSF flow in the aqueduct in 11 young controls (mean age 30 years) and 9 old controls (mean age 69 years). A high-resolution gradient echo technique and an oblique imaging plane, perpendicular to the aqueduct, was used to avoid volume averaging. Phantom studies confirmed that the technique was accurate. Aqueductal velocity and flux in old controls was higher than in young controls, but the differences were not significant. For all controls together, the averaged peak velocity was 4.2 +/- 1.5 cm/s in rostral and -7.8 +/- 4.9 cm/s in caudal direction; for the flux it was 0.16 +/- 0.10 cm3/s in rostral and -0.29 +/- 0.19 cm3/s in caudal direction. Phase-contrast measurements were significantly related to flow-void on modulus MR images, but not with ventricular size or cortical atrophy. The present technique avoids underestimation of aqueductal flow, and therefore reveals higher aqueductal velocity and flux values than previous stud…
8435048	The biological basis of the menopause.	lifespan	1993-01-??	Age-related changes occur throughout the reproductive lifespan of normal healthy women. From the age of 20, the menstrual interval gradually shortens and becomes increasingly regular until the perimenopause. This is related to a shortening of the follicular rather than the luteal phase of the cycle. Serum FSH concentration is elevated during the follicular phase in older women who are still menstruating regularly, while serum inhibin levels are decreased in both the follicular and luteal phases. The relationship between FSH secretion, ageing and feedback inhibition by oestradiol, inhibin, or other presently unmeasured factors in women with regular menses, remains to be elucidated. The primary factor influencing the transition from regular menses to the perimenopause and subsequent menopause appears to be the size of the residual primordial follicle pool. Fecundability begins to decline by the age of 29 years. There is considerable evidence from the experience gained in assisted fertili…
9398719	Increased disorderliness of basal insulin release, attenuated insulin secretory burst mass, and reduced ultradian rhythmicity of insulin secretion in older individuals.	aging	1997-12-??	Insulin is secreted in a pulsatile fashion. Rapid pulses are considered to be important for inhibiting hepatic glucose output, and ultradian pulses for stimulating peripheral glucose disposal. Aging is characterized by a progressive impairment in carbohydrate tolerance. We undertook the current studies to determine whether alterations in pulsatile insulin release accompany the age-related changes in carbohydrate metabolism. Healthy young (n = 8; body mass index, 21 +/- 1 kg/m2; age, 24 +/- 1 yr) and old (n = 9; body mass index, 24 +/- 1 kg/m2; age, 77 +/- 2 yr) volunteers underwent two studies. In the first study, insulin was sampled every 1 min for 150 min, and pulse analysis was conducted using a recently validated multiparameter deconvolution technique. In the second study, insulin was sampled every 10 min for 600 min, and insulin release was evaluated by Cluster analysis. In the 150-min studies, insulin secretory burst mass (P < 0.05) and amplitude (P < 0.01) were reduced in the el…
25102664	Visual-somatosensory integration and balance: evidence for psychophysical integrative differences in aging.	aging	2014-??-??	Research detailing multisensory integration (MSI) processes in aging and their association with clinically relevant outcomes is virtually non-existent. To our knowledge, the relationship between MSI and balance has not been well-established in aging. Given known alterations in unisensory processing with increasing age, the aims of the current study were to determine differential behavioral patterns of MSI in aging and investigate whether MSI was significantly associated with balance and fall-risk. Seventy healthy older adults (M = 75 years; 58% female) participated in the current study. Participants were instructed to make speeded responses to visual, somatosensory, and visual-somatosensory (VS) stimuli. Based on reaction times (RTs) to all stimuli, participants were classified into one of two groups (MSI or NO MSI), depending on their MSI RT benefit. Static balance was assessed using mean unipedal stance time. Overall, results revealed that RTs to VS stimuli were significantly shorter…
29853842	Oscillatory Corticospinal Activity during Static Contraction of Ankle Muscles Is Reduced in Healthy Old versus Young Adults.	aging	2018-??-??	Aging is accompanied by impaired motor function, but age-related changes in neural networks responsible for generating movement are not well understood. We aimed to investigate the functional oscillatory coupling between activity in the sensorimotor cortex and ankle muscles during static contraction. Fifteen young (20-26 yr) and fifteen older (65-73 yr) subjects were instructed to match a target force by performing static ankle dorsi- or plantar flexion, while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from the cortex and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from dorsi- (proximal and distal anterior tibia) and plantar (soleus and medial gastrocnemius) flexor muscles. EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG beta band (15-35 Hz) coherence was analyzed as an index of corticospinal activity. Our results demonstrated that beta cortico-, intra-, and intermuscular coherence was reduced in old versus young subjects during static contractions. Old subjects demonstrated significantly greater error…
23682159	Body composition explains sex differential in physical performance among older adults.	aging	2014-01-??	BACKGROUND: Older women have higher percent body fat, poorer physical function, lower strength, and higher rates of nonfatal chronic conditions than men. We sought to determine whether these differences explained physical performance differences between men and women.    METHODS: Physical performance was assessed in the Health, Aging and Body Composition study in 2,863 men and women aged 70-79 with a composite 0-4 point score consisting of chair stands, standing balance including one-leg stand, and 6-m usual and narrow walk tests. Total body composition was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry, thigh composition by computed tomography, and knee extensor strength by isokinetic dynamometer. Analysis of covariance estimated least square mean performance scores for men and women.    RESULTS: Men had higher performance scores than women (least square means: 2.33±0.02 vs 2.03±0.02, p < .0001), adjusted for race, study site, age, and height. Body composition measures (total body fat and thig…
3431356	Human cranial CSF volumes measured by MRI: sex and age influences.	aging	1987-??-??	Accurate measurements of CSF volumes would assist in the diagnosis of several important neurological conditions. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) we have devised a method to measure both total intracranial CSF volume and ventricular volume. This initial study, in normal humans, provides an answer to two longstanding questions: first, do these volumes differ between the sexes; second, do both total and ventricular CSF volumes increase with normal aging? We found that the total cranial CSF volume and skull size of males were significantly greater than those of females, but that there was not a statistically significant difference between the ventricular volumes of the sexes. Total cranial CSF volume increased steeply with age in both sexes but although there was an increase in ventricular volume with age in males, no significant increase with age could be demonstrated in females.
26371039	Food Habits, Lifestyle Factors and Mortality among Oldest Old Chinese: The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS).	longevity	2015-09-09	There are few studies reporting the association between lifestyle and mortality among the oldest old in developing countries. We examined the association between food habits, lifestyle factors and all-cause mortality in the oldest old (≥80 years) using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). In 1998/99, 8959 participants aged 80 years and older took part in the baseline survey. Follow-up surveys were conducted every two to three years until 2011. Food habits were assessed using an in-person interview. Deaths were ascertained from family members during follow-up. Cox and Laplace regression were used to assess the association between food habits, lifestyle factors and mortality risk. There were 6626 deaths during 31,926 person-years of follow-up. Type of staple food (rice or wheat) was not associated with mortality. Daily fruit and vegetable intake was inversely associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratios (HRs): 0.85 (95% CI (confidence interval) 0…
11713068	Late opacification of the foldable hydrophilic acrylic lens SC60B-OUV.	aging	2001-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause of severe central opacification in 41 foldable acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) requiring explantation. Another IOL was opacified in the original sealed vial.    DESIGN: Case series and laboratory analysis.    TESTING: Light microscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacoylamide gel electrophoresis, spectrometric analysis, and autoclaving.    RESULTS: Neither fatty acids nor proteins could be identified within the IOLs. Spectrometric analysis yielded absorption peaks in the ultraviolet spectral range.    CONCLUSIONS: The spectroscopic findings indicate premature aging of the ultraviolet blocking agent. The source of the opacification is a change in the IOL material itself.
25671466	Aging's effects on marathon performance insights from the New York City race.	aging	2015-10-??	Most studies on aging and marathon have analyzed elite marathoners, yet the latter only represent a very small fraction of all marathon participants. In addition, analysis of variance or unpaired Student t tests are frequently used to compare mean performance times across age groups. In this report the authors propose an alternative methodology to determine the impact of aging on marathon performance in both nonelite and elite marathoners participating in the New York City Marathon. In all, 471,453 data points corresponding to 370,741 different runners over 13 race editions (1999-2011) were retrieved. Results showed that the effect of aging on marathon performance was overall comparable in both sexes, the effect of aging differed between the fastest and slowest runners in both sexes, and the magnitude of the sex differences was higher in the slowest runners than in the fastest ones. Current data suggest that the biological differences between sexes allow men to have better marathon per…
20570070	Age- and sex-related changes in three-dimensional lip morphology.	aging	2010-07-15	The objective of this study was to supply information about: (1) normal sex-related dimensions of mouth and lips (linear distances, ratios, angles, area, volume); and (2) growth changes between childhood and old age. The three-dimensional coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the lips and face were obtained by a non-invasive, computerized electromagnetic digitizer in 532 male and 386 female healthy subjects aged 4-73 years. From the landmarks, linear distances (mouth width, width of the philtrum, vermilion heights of the upper, lower and total lips, total lip height), the vermilion height-to-mouth width ratio, areas (vermilion of the upper, lower and total lip) and volumes (upper, lower, and total lip volume) were calculated and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. Mouth width, width of the philtrum, total lip height, and lip volumes were significantly larger in men than in women (p<0.01), increased with age (p<0.001), and ha…
11915118	The 20th century. Looking back at the ambiance of aging from the perspective of age-specific journals and periodicals.	longevity, aging	2001-06-??	The word "aging" is fraught with nuance, both positive and negative. The purpose of this article is to describe the results of a preliminary exploration of the ambiance of the concept of aging in the United States as seen from the perspective of periodical literature from the past century. A convenience sample of professional journals and lay periodicals concerned with aging and the issues of aging was selected as the focus for this investigation. Specifically, volume one, number one of the selected journals was examined with regard to the date of the first publication, the table of contents, and the first issue editorial or articles in the first volume describing the motivation for the introduction of the journal. Findings indicated that as the century progressed and the study of aging took form, the focus shifted from how to manage the problems of aging to: (a) how to promote healthier young adult lifestyles to increase the chances of a healthy old age, (b) how to continue to maintai…
2333989	Age alters pulsatile prolactin release: influence of dopaminergic inhibition.	aging	1990-05-??	To determine the effect of age on pulsatile prolactin secretion, we examined prolactin pulse characteristics by cluster analysis in healthy young and old male subjects during the day and night. Pulsatile prolactin secretion was identified in all subjects during the day and night, and prolactin pulse frequency remains stable with age. Younger subjects had a significantly higher prolactin pulse amplitude, area, and peak interval during the night compared with older subjects. In contrast, daytime prolactin pulse characteristics were similar in young and old subjects. Because the major neuroregulator of prolactin is dopamine and because normal aging has been reported to be associated with reductions in hypothalamic dopamine content and effect, we determined whether the mechanism of altered day-night prolactin pulsatile secretion was due to changes in dopaminergic tone. We examined endogenous prolactin secretion after administration of the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide. Metoclopramide …
3558232	Effect of age and training on aerobic capacity and body composition of master athletes.	aging	1987-02-??	Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and body composition have been shown to deteriorate with age. How much of the decline is attributable to aging and how much is affected by reduced physical activity is not known. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the aerobic capacity and body composition of 24 master track athletes and to evaluate the relationship to age and maintenance of training over a 10-yr period. The subjects (50-82 yr of age) were retested after a 10.1-yr follow-up (T2). All continued their aerobic training, but only 11 were still highly competitive (COMP) and continued to train at the same intensity. The other 13 athletes studied became noncompetitive (post-COMP) and reduced their training intensity. The results showed the COMP group to maintain its VO2max and maximum O2 pulse while the post-COMP group showed a significant decline (54.2-53.3 vs. 52.5-45.9 ml X kg-1 X min-1; 20.7-20.8 vs. 22.4-20.0 ml/beat from test one (T1) to T2 for the COMP vs. post-COMP groups,…
8806666	c-fos/c-jun expression and AP-1 activation in skin fibroblasts from centenarians.	aging	1996-09-13	In vitro replicative senescence is characterized by an irreversible growth arrest due to the inability of the cell to induce some key regulators of cell cycle progression, such as c-fos and AP-1, in response to mitogenic stimuli. In vitro replicative senescence and in vivo aging have been assumed to be two related phenomena, likely controlled by overlapping or interacting genes. As a corollary, fibroblasts from centenarians, which have undergone a long process of senescence in vivo should have very limited proliferative capability. On the contrary, in a previous work we found that fibroblasts from centenarians exhibited the same capacity to respond to different mitogenic stimuli as fibroblasts from young donors. Here we provide evidences that the well preserved proliferative response is likely due to the fact that some pivotal regulators- c-fos, c-jun and AP-1-are still fully inducible, despite a long process of in vivo senescence. Our data therefore suggest that in vivo and in vitro a…
21306808	Health inputs and cumulative health deficits among the older Chinese.	longevity, aging	2011-03-??	Using a health economics framework, we examined how both individual level investments at different life stages and current community-level environmental factors affect individual health stock and flows at old ages. We used a nationwide dataset from the 2002 and 2005 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, which included more than 15,000 adults aged 65 and older from 22 provinces in mainland China. We measured health stock with a cumulative health deficit index, a measure developed in geriatrics and gerontology that reflects deficits, illnesses, and functional impairment in numerous domains of health. The cumulative health deficit index has not been used in health economics before, but is a significant contribution because it captures the health stock concept very well and overcomes the problems of inconsistency resulting from the use of different measures of health stock in research. Our results show that several proxy measures for individual health investments in b…
22546961	Association of a Modified Physiologic Index with mortality and incident disability: the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study.	aging	2012-12-??	BACKGROUND: Indexes constructed from components may identify individuals who age well across systems. We studied the associations of a Modified Physiologic Index (systolic blood pressure, forced vital capacity, Digit Symbol Substitution Test score, serum cystatin-C, serum fasting glucose) with mortality and incident disability.    METHODS: Data are from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study on 2,737 persons (51.2% women, 40.3% black) aged 70-79 years at baseline and followed on average 9.3 (2.9) years. Components were graded 0 (healthiest), 1 (middle), or 2 (unhealthiest) by tertile or clinical cutpoints and summed to calculate a continuous index score (range 0-10). We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate risk of death or disability and determined accuracy predicting death using the area under the curve.    RESULTS: Mortality was 19% greater per index unit (p < .05). Those with highest index scores (scores 7-10) had 3.53-fold greater mortality than…
26264732	The effect of aging on vertical postural control during the forward and backward shift of the center of pressure.	aging	2015-10-??	Preventing fall-related injuries is becoming a priority as the world population ages. This study's purpose was to examine the effect of aging on vertical postural control in the community-dwelling elderly. Thirty-six elderly individuals and twenty-two healthy young adults were asked to shift their centers of pressure (COPs) as far as possible while standing. The COP position, angle of each lower leg joint, and postural muscle activities were measured using a force plate, three-dimensional motion analyzer, and electromyogram, respectively. The vertical position of the center of mass (COM) was also measured to assess the change in vertical postural control. The backward COP shift in the elderly group was significantly smaller than that in the young group, and both the forward and backward COM shifts were significantly smaller in elders relative to those in youths. The COM position in the elderly group during the backward COP shift was also significantly lower than that in the young group…
26005337	_"I am active": effects of a program to promote active aging.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND: Active aging involves a general lifestyle strategy that allows preservation of both physical and mental health during the aging process. "I am Active" is a program designed to promote active aging by increased physical activity, healthy nutritional habits, and cognitive functioning. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of this program.    METHODS: Sixty-four healthy adults aged 60 years or older were recruited from senior centers and randomly allocated to an experimental group (n=31) or a control group (n=33). Baseline, post-test, and 6-month follow-up assessments were performed after the theoretical-practical intervention. Effect sizes were calculated.    RESULTS: At the conclusion of the program, the experimental group showed significant improvement compared with the control group in the following domains: physical activity (falls risk, balance, flexibility, self-efficacy), nutrition (self-efficacy and nutritional status), cognitive performance (proce…
20152907	Insight into the patterns of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the human ventricular system using MR velocity mapping.	aging	2010-05-15	The patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the human ventricular system are still not fully understood in all their complexity. Knowledge is based on either the interpretation of CSF flow curves or computational simulations. Both approaches only provide an incomplete insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of CSF flow. Time-resolved three-dimensional magnetic resonance velocity mapping has previously been used to investigate normal and pathologic blood flow patterns in the human vascular system. Here we used this technique to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of CSF flow in the ventricular system of 40 normal volunteers. Classification of the patterns of CSF flow based on calculation of three-dimensional particle path lines over the cardiac cycle revealed one uniform flow pattern for the lateral ventricles, three categories for the third and two categories for the fourth ventricle. We found no significant aging effects on either the presence of a specific CSF fl…
30583397	Use of oak wood during malolactic fermentation and ageing: Impact on chardonnay wine character.	aging	2019-04-25	Malolactic fermentation (MLF) and oak barrels aging are two oenological processes which modify wine composition and sensory characteristics. The effect of MLF-container (stainless steel tanks, barrels) and barrel toasting (T1, T2, T3) on ellagitannin concentration, volatile composition and sensory attributes of Chardonnay wines was evaluated. Barrel toasting had higher impact on ellagitannin content than MLF-container. When comparing both MLF-modalities, barrel-fermented wines exhibited greater amounts of vanillin and whiskey-lactones but lower concentrations of fruity aroma compounds. Regarding sensory analysis, greater citrus and floral aromas were perceived for MLF-tank wines, and higher nuts aroma for MLF-barrel wines. Using barrels as MLF-containers i) did not change the aroma perception defining Chardonnay character (peach, apricot and gun flint); ii) did not impact the aromatic intensity and persistence, sweetness, acidity, mouthfeel volume and/or bitterness; and iii) did not co…
11486028	Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence.	aging	2001-09-??	Cellular aging is accompanied by alterations in gene expression patterns. Here, using two models of replicative senescence, we describe the influence of the RNA-binding protein HuR in regulating the expression of several genes whose expression decreases during senescence. We demonstrate that HuR levels, HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding proliferative genes, and the half-lives of such mRNAs are lower in senescent cells. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a "younger" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. Our studies highlight a critical role for HuR during the process of replicative senescence.
18483165	Decreased maximal heart rate with aging is related to reduced {beta}-adrenergic responsiveness but is largely explained by a reduction in intrinsic heart rate.	aging	2008-07-??	A decrease in maximal exercise heart rate (HR(max)) is a key contributor to reductions in aerobic exercise capacity with aging. However, the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. We sought to gain insight into the respective roles of intrinsic heart rate (HR(int)) and chronotropic beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the reductions in HR(max) with aging in healthy adults. HR(max) (Balke treadmill protocol to exhaustion), HR(int) (HR during acute ganglionic blockade with intravenous trimethaphan), and chronotropic beta-adrenergic responsiveness (increase in HR with incremental intravenous infusion of isoproterenol during ganglionic blockade) were determined in 15 older (65 +/- 5 yr) and 15 young (25 +/- 4 yr) healthy men. In the older men, HR(max) was lower (162 +/- 9 vs. 191 +/- 11 beats/min, P < 0.0001) and was associated with a lower HR(int) (58 +/- 7 vs. 83 +/- 9 beats/min, P < 0.0001) and chronotropic beta-adrenergic responsiveness (0.094 +/- 0.036 vs. 0.154 +/- 0.045 Delta…
24152691	Validation of an instrument to evaluate quality of life in the aging population: WHOQOL-AGE.	aging	2013-10-23	BACKGROUND: There is a need for short, specific instruments that assess quality of life (QOL) adequately in the older adult population. The aims of the present study were to obtain evidence on the validity of the inferences that could be drawn from an instrument to measure QOL in the aging population (people 50+ years old), and to test its psychometric properties.    METHODS: The instrument, WHOQOL-AGE, comprised 13 positive items, assessed on a five-point rating scale, and was administered to nationally representative samples (n = 9987) from Finland, Poland, and Spain. Cronbach's alpha was employed to assess internal consistency reliability, whereas the validity of the questionnaire was assessed by means of factor analysis, graded response model, Pearson's correlation coefficient and unpaired t-test. Normative values were calculated across countries and for different age groups.    RESULTS: The satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices confirmed that the factorial structure of WHOQOL-AGE c…
7477814	Healthy aging, memory subsystems and regional cerebral oxygen consumption.	aging	1995-07-??	The present study was designed to search for concomitant age-related changes in memory subsystems, defined according to current structural theories, and resting oxygen consumption in selected brain regions. We have investigated a sample of subjects between 20 and 68 years of age and strictly screened for their good health. We applied in the same subjects a battery of neuropsychological tests selected to investigate several memory subsystems, and high-resolution positron imaging with stereotaxic localization to study a purposely limited number of cerebral structures, selected on a priori hypotheses to match the different memory subsystems. Our results showed significant age-related changes in performance on some tests, consistent with the literature, including an increase in semantic memory and a decrease in both working memory (central executive system) and verbal episodic and explicit memory. There was also an age-related linear decrease in global brain oxygen consumption which region…
18002119	Effect of gender on blood flow velocities and blood pressure: role of body weight and height.	aging	2007-??-??	Aging and gender alter arterial hemodynamic function. Gender-related differences in body size may affect the arterial hemodynamics such as systolic blood pressure, wave reflection and pressure wave propagation. To assess the possibility that the differences of carotid blood velocities and brachial blood pressure in women are related to body size, we investigated the arterial hemodynamics in 50 healthy young adults (30 men, 20 women) between the age ranges of 20 to 29 years old. Blood velocities are characterized to 5 components of velocity waveforms as peak systolic (S1), second systolic (S2), incisura between systole and diastole (I), peak diastolic (D) and end-diastolic velocity wave (d). As the most pronounced systolic blood pressure is lower in young women than men (P<0.05). Women have higher diastolic velocity components and second systolic velocity, but have lower systolic velocity compared to men. From that, women have a significant greater wave reflection, smaller vascular resi…
2145584	Changes in plasma DHEAS circadian rhythm in elderly men.	aging	1990-??-??	Several reports focused the attention on aging that appears to exert an influence on the temporal structure in the endocrine system of man. Considering that: a) DHEAS blood levels consistently decrease as men age and b) this hormone might be involved in the early development of atherosclerosis, aim of the present work to detect: 1) the possible existence of a circadian rhythm of DHEAS in young and elderly men, 2) eventual change in parameters of other hormonal rhythms. 11 young healthy males (28 +/- 2 yrs) and 12 elderly males (73 +/- 1 yrs) were studied over a 24-hr span during spring. They were submitted to the circadian protocol for the evaluation of DHEAS, PRL and cortisol plasma levels. A significant circadian rhythm of DHEAS plasma levels was observed in the young men (mesor micrograms/dl 273.13 +/- 38.25, amplitude 41.37 +/- 9.29, acrophase at 1351 hr). In the elderly subjects no circadian rhythm was found, but amplitude and mesor appeared statistically reduced in comparison wit…
23525044	Dopamine restores reward prediction errors in old age.	aging	2013-05-??	Senescence affects the ability to utilize information about the likelihood of rewards for optimal decision-making. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we found that healthy older adults had an abnormal signature of expected value, resulting in an incomplete reward prediction error (RPE) signal in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that receives rich input projections from substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Structural connectivity between SN/VTA and striatum, measured by diffusion tensor imaging, was tightly coupled to inter-individual differences in the expression of this expected reward value signal. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) increased the task-based learning rate and task performance in some older adults to the level of young adults. This drug effect was linked to restoration of a canonical neural RPE. Our results identify a neurochemical signature underlying abnormal reward processing in older adults and indica…
25795963	Comparative analysis between two models of active aging and its influence on body composition, strength levels and quality of life: long-distance runners versus bodybuilders practitioners.	aging	2015-04-01	AIM: To analyze the body composition, strength level, and the quality of life related to the health (QoL) in veteran sportsmen (>35 years old) in relation to sedentary ones (S), and to compare the result in the mentioned variables between two models of sports practice, long-distance runners (LDR) and bodybuilding practitioners (BBP).    METHODS: One hundred forty-eight male participants took part and were distributed into three groups: 47 LDR (age=42.01±6.96 years), 49 BBP (age=45.14±7.04 years), and 47 S (age=43.71±8.75 years). Body composition, upper- and lower-limb strength level, and QoL were assessed.    RESULTS: The LDR and BBP obtained better performance in countermovement jump (CMJ) than the S ones (+0.06 m, p<0.001). Significant differences were found in BMI and %fat mass, between BBP and S with relation to LDR (p<0.001). In relation to the effect of aging on body composition, the muscle mass is reduced in all groups controlled (LDR, BBP, and S). Additionally, the %fat mass is…
10100403	Lower 24-h blood pressure regimen in subjects with a familial genealogy of longevity.	longevity	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern in longevous subjects and their progeny, in order to validate the hypothesis that the human beings who live beyond their longest expectancy of life should be protected from developing hypertension. Such a characteristic feature is supposed to be a biological aspect of human longevity which can be transmitted to the progeny.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 92 elderly subjects, (45 M, 47 W, 76-102 years), and 28 firstborn descendants of the first (7 M, 7 W, 36-55 years) and second (7 M, 7 W, 16-26 years) generation, in clinical health. The control subjects were 308 clinically healthy individuals (154 M, 154 F, 16-75 years) of the common population, stratified by age.    RESULTS: The longevous subjects were found to show a diastolic daily mean level less pronounced than expected, according to the BP age-related trend in the common population. Both the children and grandchildren of the longevous …
9180666	The relation between antioxidants and memory performance in the old and very old.	aging	1997-06-??	OBJECTIVES: Aging processes, and among them brain aging, are thought to be associated with free radical action. It is hypothesized that plasma antioxidant vitamin levels correlate with cognitive performance in healthy older subjects.    DESIGN: Longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons.    SETTING: The city of Basle, considered representative of the older urban population in Switzerland.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 442 subjects aged 65 to 94 years (mean: 75 years; 312 male, 132 female) was selected from a random sample.    MEASUREMENTS: In 1993, participants were tested for memory, and plasma vitamin levels were measured for the three antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and beta-carotene. These vitamin parameters, measured previously in 1971 in the same sample, were integrated in our analyses. In addition, plasma cholesterol, ferritin, and systolic blood pressure were taken into account. Memory variables were priming, working-memory, free recall, recognition and the WAIS-R…
28408140	Differential menopause- versus aging-induced changes in oxidative stress and circadian rhythm gene markers.	aging	2017-??-??	Menopause is characterized by the depletion of estrogen that has been proposed to cause oxidative stress. Circadian rhythm is an internal biological clock that controls physiological processes. It was analyzed the gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the lipids and glucose levels in plasma of a subgroup of 17 pre-menopausal women, 19 men age-matched as control group for the pre-menopausal women, 20 post-menopausal women and 20 men age-matched as control group for the post-menopausal women; all groups were matched by body mass index. Our study showed a decrease in the expression of the oxidative stress-related gene GPX1, and an increase in the expression of SOD1 as consequence of menopause. In addition, we found that the circadian rhythm-related gene PER2 decreased as consequence of menopause. On the other hand, we observed a decrease in the expression of the oxidative stress-related gene GPX4 and an increase in the expression of CAT as a consequence of aging, indep…
19969291	Anti-Müllerian hormone and inhibin B variability during normal menstrual cycles.	aging	2010-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To describe anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) variation across normal menstrual cycles.    DESIGN: Cohort study.    SETTING: Academic environment.    PATIENT(S): Twenty regularly menstruating women.    INTERVENTION(S): Serum AMH and inhibin B assayed daily during one normal menstrual cycle.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Intracycle variability of AMH and inhibin B.    RESULT(S): Data were classified into quartiles of AMH area-under-the-curve (AUCs). Mean AMH AUC was 15.7 ng/mL for quartile 1 versus 43.5, 80.9 and 144.9 ng/mL for quartiles 2, 3, and 4. Mean AMH levels (ng/mL) were 0.67, 1.71, 3.02, and 5.33, respectively. There was no variation in quartile 1 AMH rate of change from stochastic modeling, but in quartiles 2 to 4, there were increased rates of change in days 2 to 7. Women in quartile 1 had the lowest mean inhibin B (24.2 pg/mL vs. 44.3, 43.2, and 42.2 pg/mL), and had shorter menstrual cycles (24.6 days) than women in quartiles 3 and 4 (28.2 and 28.4 days).    CONCLUSION(…
9796086	_"Run, Jane, run": central tensions in the current debate about enhancing women's health through exercise.	lifespan	1998-??-??	The advancement of access and opportunities for girls and women in health enhancing physical activity in recent decades is a matter of record. Yet despite burgeoning interest and increased female participation in sport and recreational physical activity, few women are active enough to benefit their health. Even after extensive government campaigns are repeatedly used to educate the public, fewer women than men participate in every age group. Something is drastically wrong when exercise is said to be associated with so many health benefits, yet only a small portion of the female population exercises sufficiently to accrue these benefits. It is important to critically evaluate the challenges inherent in achieving social equity in opportunities for healthy physical activity for all women. As we gain new understandings about how health gains can be achieved by reducing social inequality rather than providing more medical care, we can see how involvement in healthy exercise is closely entwi…
7943310	Postprandial myofibrillar and whole body protein synthesis in young and old human subjects.	aging	1994-10-??	Rates of incorporation of leucine (using L-[1-13C]leucine as a tracer) into myofibrillar and whole body proteins were determined in healthy old (> 60 yr old, n = 7) and young (< 30 yr old, n = 9) men and women who were fed small meals (4% of daily energy) every 30 min. There was no difference in whole body incorporation of leucine into proteins in the young (148 +/- 5 mumol.h-1.kg lean body mass-1, means +/- SE) and old groups (150 +/- 3 mumol.h-1.kg lean body mass-1). However, the fractional myofibrillar protein synthesis in the vastus lateralis muscle was 28% slower in the older group (0.063 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.088 +/- 0.003 %/h, P < 0.001). Extrapolation of these results to whole body myofibrillar synthesis (fractional rate x myofibrillar mass estimated by creatinine excretion) indicated that, in the older group, total myofibrillar synthesis was 43% slower (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.2 g/h, P < 0.01) and that their myofibrillar synthesis was a smaller portion of whole body protein synthe…
23796946	Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids improve brain function and structure in older adults.	aging	2014-11-??	Higher intake of seafish or oil rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-n3-FA) may be beneficial for the aging brain. We tested in a prospective interventional design whether high levels of supplementary LC-n3-FA would improve cognition, and addressed potential mechanisms underlying the effects. Sixty-five healthy subjects (50-75 years, 30 females) successfully completed 26 weeks of either fish oil (2.2 g/day LC-n3-FA) or placebo intake. Before and after the intervention period, cognitive performance, structural neuroimaging, vascular markers, and blood parameters were assayed. We found a significant increase in executive functions after LC-n3-FA compared with placebo (P = 0.023). In parallel, LC-n3-FA exerted beneficial effects on white matter microstructural integrity and gray matter volume in frontal, temporal, parietal, and limbic areas primarily of the left hemisphere, and on carotid intima media thickness and diastolic blood pressure. Improvements in executive …
9475871	Influence of age and gender on cardiac output-VO2 relationships during submaximal cycle ergometry.	aging	1998-02-??	It is presently unclear how gender, aging, and physical activity status interact to determine the magnitude of the rise in cardiac output (Qc) during dynamic exercise. To clarify this issue, the present study examined the Qc-O2 uptake (Vo2) relationship during graded leg cycle ergometry in 30 chronically endurance-trained subjects from four groups (n = 6-8/group): younger men (20-30 yr), older men (56-72 yr), younger women (24-31 yr), and older women (51-72 yr). Qc (acetylene rebreathing), stroke volume (Qc/heart rate), and whole body Vo2 were measured at rest and during submaximal exercise intensities (40, 70, and approximately 90% of peak Vo2). Baseline resting levels of Qc were 0.6-1.2 l/min less in the older groups. However, the slopes of the Qc-Vo2 relationship across submaximal levels of cycling were similar among all four groups (5.4-5.9 l/l). The absolute Qc associated with a given Vo2 (1.0-2.0 l/min) was also similar among groups. Resting and exercise stroke volumes (ml/beat) …
1551520	Effect of aging on gastric and duodenal mucosal prostaglandin concentrations in humans.	aging	1992-04-??	The effect of aging on gastric and duodenal mucosal prostaglandins has not been reported. Gastric and duodenal mucosal prostaglandin concentrations were measured in 46 healthy adults, 35 of whom were relatively young (21-40 years old) and 11 of whom were considerably more elderly (aged 52-72 years). Mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained endoscopically from the fundus, antrum, duodenal bulb, and postbulbar duodenum, and extracts were assayed for prostaglandin F2 alpha and E2 concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Older age was associated with significantly lower fundic, antral, and post-bulbar duodenal prostaglandin concentrations. A second experiment was performed in 20 additional subjects (9 younger, 11 older) to determine whether lower mucosal concentrations in older subjects were reproducible and, if so, whether reduced gastric mucosal prostaglandins would have a physiological counterpart, namely increased gastric acid secretion. As in the original experiment, fundic, antral, and post…
8509374	Oxidized amino acids in lens protein with age. Measurement of o-tyrosine and dityrosine in the aging human lens.	aging	1993-06-15	The concentrations of ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr) and dityrosine (DT) were measured in noncataractous human lenses in order to assess the role of protein oxidation reactions in the aging of lens proteins. The measurements were conducted by selected ion monitoring-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using deuterium-labeled internal standards, which provided both high sensitivity and specificity for the quantitation of o-Tyr and DT. Between ages 1 and 78 years, the o-Tyr concentration in lens proteins varied from 0.3 to 0.9 mmol of o-Tyr/mol of Phe (n = 19), while DT ranged from 1 to 3 mumol of DT/mol of Tyr (n = 30). There were no significant changes in levels of o-Tyr with lens age. There was a statistically significant, but only slight, increase in DT in lens proteins with age (approximately 33% increases between ages 1 and 78, r = 0.5, p < 0.01). At the same time, total protein fluorescence, measured at DT wavelengths (Ex = 317 nm, Em = 407 nm), increased 11-fold between ages 1 and 78 an…
23831263	Daytime trajectories of cortisol: demographic and socioeconomic differences--findings from the National Study of Daily Experiences.	aging	2013-11-??	Cortisol's daytime rhythm is thought to be altered by aging and by exposure to chronic stress. However, measurement of an individual's usual cortisol rhythm is hampered by the effects of acute stressors, by differences between working days and weekends, by between-day variation in waking time and sleep duration, by variability in cortisol sampling times, and by possible variability in the timing of cortisol peak and nadir. Therefore, to determine differences in the usual daytime cortisol rhythm by age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, we measured salivary cortisol levels at four time-points, repeated over four days that included both weekdays and weekend days, in 1693 men and women from a national sample, and used three alternate growth curve specifications for the underlying cortisol rhythm (linear spline, quadratic spline, piece-wise linear-cubic) in order to minimize the impact of sample timing and other methodological issues. Model-predicted mean values of (and demographic…
15708440	Mitochondrial DNA mutations in RRF of healthy subjects of different age.	aging	2005-05-??	To obtain information on the mechanisms responsible of the generation of ragged red fibers (RRF) during aging, we analyzed the mitochondrial genotype of single skeletal muscle fibers of healthy individuals having an age comprised between 45 and 92 years. The sequencing of the D-loop region showed many sequence changes with respect to the Cambridge reference sequence (CRS), in both RRF and normal fibers. These changes were more abundant in RRF and their number increased between 50 and 60, and 61 and 70 years and then remained approximately constant. The analysis of the sequence changes showed that each subject contained one or more changes associated to RRF in positions of D-loop region that either do not change or that change very rarely. In general the same type of RRF-associated change was not found in more than one individual; exceptions were changes in positions 189, 295, 374 and 514, detected in 20-50% of analyzed subjects. In particular the A189G age-associated mutation was found…
27185560	Gut Microbiota and Extreme Longevity.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2016-??-06	The study of the extreme limits of human lifespan may allow a better understanding of how human beings can escape, delay, or survive the most frequent age-related causes of morbidity, a peculiarity shown by long-living individuals. Longevity is a complex trait in which genetics, environment, and stochasticity concur to determine the chance to reach 100 or more years of age [1]. Because of its impact on human metabolism and immunology, the gut microbiome has been proposed as a possible determinant of healthy aging [2, 3]. Indeed, the preservation of host-microbes homeostasis can counteract inflammaging [4], intestinal permeability [5], and decline in bone and cognitive health [6, 7]. Aiming at deepening our knowledge on the relationship between the gut microbiota and a long-living host, we provide for the first time the phylogenetic microbiota analysis of semi-supercentenarians, i.e., 105-109 years old, in comparison to adults, elderly, and centenarians, thus reconstructing the longest …
17981307	Aging memory for pictures: using high-density event-related potentials to understand the effect of aging on the picture superiority effect.	aging	2008-01-31	High-density event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to understand the effect of aging on the neural correlates of the picture superiority effect. Pictures and words were systematically varied at study and test while ERPs were recorded at retrieval. Here, the results of the word-word and picture-picture study-test conditions are presented. Behavioral results showed that older adults demonstrated the picture superiority effect to a greater extent than younger adults. The ERP data helped to explain these findings. The early frontal effect, parietal effect, and late frontal effect were all indistinguishable between older and younger adults for pictures. In contrast, for words, the early frontal and parietal effects were significantly diminished for the older adults compared to the younger adults. These two old/new effects have been linked to familiarity and recollection, respectively, and the authors speculate that these processes are impaired for word-based memory in the course of heal…
23452090	Age-related skeletal muscle mass loss and physical performance in Taiwan: implications to diagnostic strategy of sarcopenia in Asia.	aging	2013-10-??	AIM: Skeletal muscle loss is a common feature of aging, and is associated with unfavorable outcomes. Although several indexes of skeletal muscle mass measurement have been developed, the most optimal index for sarcopenia diagnosis among Asian populations has remained unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and physical performance among community-dwelling people in Taiwan.    METHODS: Data of the I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study (ILAS) were retrieved for study. Comparisons between demographic profiles, physical performance and skeletal muscle mass (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were carried out. Skeletal muscle mass expressed by lean body mass divided by squared height (LBM/ht(2) ), appendicular muscle mass divided by squared height (ASM/ht(2) ) and percent skeletal muscle index (SMI%) were compared between measurements of physical performance.    RESULTS: Overall, the data of 532 participants (mean age 64.6 ± 9.5 years, …
2055556	Age-related changes in interleukin 2 responsiveness of resting and activated human mononuclear cells.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Although the "T cell model" on the immunological decline associated with aging is gaining increasing support, the relationship between response to IL2 and aging has not yet been investigated.    METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy elderly donors were cultured with increasing concentrations (1-1000 U/ml) of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL2).    RESULTS: PBMC from older donors proliferated as much as those from younger donors until the fifth day of culture, but showed a reduced capability to proliferate in the following days (8th and 10th). Culturing PBMC with PHA we obtained the opposite result. In fact, the known depressed proliferative response of elderly people to the mitogen PHA is detectable only in the early days of culture. Furthermore, the response to rIL2 of 1% or 0.125% PHA-stimulated PBMC showed an important impairment of the proliferative rate in the elderly population with respect to younger controls, although no differences in t…
8759518	Differential phosphorylation of alpha-A crystallin in human lens of different age.	aging	1996-05-??	Previous studies have demonstrated that a major site of in vivo phosphorylation of alpha-A crystallin from human lens is serine-122. To determine the relative degree of this phosphorylation in alpha-A crystallin from human lenses of different age, alpha-A crystallin was purified from total lens proteins, followed by sequential digestion with lys-C and asp-N endoproteases. Mass spectral analysis of the asp-N peptide fragments that contained serine-122 demonstrated undetectable levels of phosphorylation from infant human lenses (41 days, 2 months and 4 months of age). Identical analysis of alpha-A crystallin from older lenses (12, 15, 40 and 73 years of age) indicated significant phosphorylation of serine-122, demonstrating that phosphorylation of the serine-122 residue of alpha-A crystallin does not occur during the aging process, but is rather a developmentally regulated event in the human lens.

It is unclear during human aging whether healthy older adults (>70 yr old) experience greater, lesser, or the same fatigability compared with younger adults. The reported disparate findings may be related to the task-dependent nature of fatigue and the limited number of studies exploring nonisometric contractile function and aging. The purpose here was to determine the effects of fast shortening contractions on the fatigability of the triceps surae in 10 young (~24 yr old) and 10 old (~78 yr old) men using isometric and dynamic measures. Participants performed 50 maximal velocity-dependent plantar flexions at a constant load of 20% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC). Isometric twitch properties and MVCs were tested at baseline and during and following the fatigue task. Voluntary activation was similar between the old and young (~98%) and was unaltered with fatigue. The old had 26% lower (P < 0.01) isometric MVC torque and 18% slower (P < 0.01) maximal shortening velocity tha…
27018287	Public health approach to preventing frailty in the community and its effect on healthy aging in Japan.	aging	2016-03-??	Effective methods to prevent or delay the onset of frailty are urgently required in aging societies, such as Japan. As a public health approach, we carried out a 10-year community intervention for frailty prevention, and examined its impact on healthy aging among older adults. The target population was all residents aged 65 years or older in the town of Kusatsu, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. For community empowerment, we organized a community forum, and discussed how to address the frailty issue in the community. For primary prevention, we attempted to promote physical activity, nutrition and social participation by means of a health education program to motivate older residents. For secondary prevention, we added a comprehensive geriatric assessment to routine annual health check-ups, which helped older participants improve self-care ability of functional health. High-risk persons were screened and encouraged to participate in a frailty prevention class with a multicomponent program. The a…
11602213	Activin A serum levels and aging of the pituitary-gonadal axis: a cross-sectional study in middle-aged and elderly healthy subjects.	aging	2001-08-??	Aim of the study was to investigate activin A serum concentration in healthy adult males and post-menopausal females over a wide age-range and its correlation to gonadotropins, inhibin B and testosterone concentrations. The study included 73 males (aged 30-101 years) and 42 postmenopausal females (aged 50-104 years). Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast to measure serum activin A, inhibin B, LH, FSH, and gonadal steroid levels. A significant increase in serum activin A levels over age in both genders, especially in the oldest age-groups, was observed. Serum inhibin B and testosterone concentrations showed a sharp decrease in male subjects, reflecting the age-related decrease of testicular function and by consequence serum FSH and LH significantly increased. In female subjects LH and FSH levels were very high in subjects in their 50s and showed a continuous decline due to pituitary aging. Simple and multivariable regression analyses demonstrated the lack of correlation b…
24778456	S-sulfhydration of MEK1 leads to PARP-1 activation and DNA damage repair.	aging	2014-07-??	The repair of DNA damage is fundamental to normal cell development and replication. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel gasotransmitter that has been reported to protect cellular aging. Here, we show that H2S attenuates DNA damage in human endothelial cells and fibroblasts by S-sulfhydrating MEK1 at cysteine 341, which leads to PARP-1 activation. H2S-induced MEK1 S-sulfhydration facilitates the translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 into nucleus, where it activates PARP-1 through direct interaction. Mutation of MEK1 cysteine 341 inhibits ERK phosphorylation and PARP-1 activation. In the presence of H2S, activated PARP-1 recruits XRCC1 and DNA ligase III to DNA breaks to mediate DNA damage repair, and cells are protected from senescence.
1965806	Superoxide radical production after phorbol ester stimulation in neutrophils of aged donors.	aging	1990-??-??	Superoxide anion radical production was studied in purified neutrophils of young and old donors after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to determine whether phorbol-stimulated activation of NADPH-oxidase was altered by aging. Superoxide radical production of neutrophils of healthy ambulatory elderly (mean age 73 years) was increased compared to young adult controls. Expressed as nmol superoxide/min/mg protein, however, old cells were no different from young. Neutrophils of the elderly contained nearly 20% more protein/cell than young cells, yet neutrophil diameter and volume were not increased in the old cells. Binding affinity and maximum binding capacity of 3H-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were similar in young and old neutrophils. Maximum binding capacity was similar whether expressed on a per cell or per mg protein basis. Although others have suggested that initial plasma membrane events leading to superoxide radical production are diminished in aging cells, these studies…
23441119	Carbon turnover in the water-soluble protein of the adult human lens.	longevity	2013-??-??	PURPOSE: Human eye lenses contain cells that persist from embryonic development. These unique, highly specialized fiber cells located at the core (nucleus) of the lens undergo pseudo-apoptosis to become devoid of cell nuclei and most organelles. Ostensibly lacking in protein transcriptional capabilities, it is currently believed that these nuclear fiber cells owe their extreme longevity to the perseverance of highly stable and densely packed crystallin proteins. Maintaining the structural and functional integrity of lenticular proteins is necessary to sustain cellular transparency and proper vision, yet the means by which the lens actually copes with a lifetime of oxidative stress, seemingly without any capacity for protein turnover and repair, is not completely understood. Although many years of research have been predicated upon the assumption that there is no protein turnover or renewal in nuclear fiber cells, we investigated whether or not different protein fractions possess protei…
11842037	Influence of delayed isotopic equilibration in urine on the accuracy of the (2)H(2)(18)O method in the elderly.	aging	2002-03-??	Isotopic determination of total energy expenditure (TEE) by the doubly labeled water (DLW) method may be affected by urine retention in the elderly. The isotopic enrichments in urine and plasma sampled simultaneously 4 h post-DLW dose were compared in a subset of 281 subjects [139 women, 142 men, 75 +/- 3 (SD) yr] of the 3,075 participants in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Based on analytic precisions, a +/- 2% urine-plasma difference was set as the cut-off value. Ten percent of the population presented a difference lower than -2%, suggesting a delay in urine isotopic equilibration. This -13 +/- 10% urine-plasma difference was not linked to analytic errors, illnesses, the sampling time, or the time and quantity of water intake, suggesting that urine retention may be the main factor. The consequences are an 18 +/- 13 and 21 +/- 16% overestimation of the total body water and the TEE, respectively. Unexpectedly, 21% of the population presented a urine-plasma difference hig…
11438118	Cytokine production by stimulated mononuclear cells did not change with aging in apparently healthy, well-nourished women.	aging	2001-09-??	Aging is often associated with a dysregulation of the immune system. We examined mitogen-stimulated production of interleukin (IL)-2 and proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-6, in apparently healthy and generally well-nourished old versus young women. Subjects were screened for health using the SENIEUR protocol and a panel of laboratory tests for inflammation, as well as for the adequacy of nutritional status using criteria related to undernutrition, and protein, iron, vitamin B(12), and folate status. Young (n=26, age: 20-40 years) and old (n=44, age: 62-88 years) cohorts did not differ on the number of circulating monocytes, granulocytes, B (CD19+) cells, and T (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) cells. No differences (P>0.10) were seen between the two age groups in IL-2, IL-1beta and IL-6 levels in whole blood cultures at 48 h after stimulation with PHA (5 mg/l). Furthermore, no age-related differences were noted in the absolute amounts (pg) of IL-1beta and IL-6 after normalizing for circu…
8307881	Ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 in hyperoxia and hypoxia in older aged humans.	aging	1993-11-??	Findings from studies of the effects of aging on the human respiratory controller are equivocal. This study assessed the ventilatory response to CO2 in hyperoxia and hypoxia in groups of younger (YS) and older (OS) humans. Two protocols were used. In the first, end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) was clamped at 1-2 Torr above rest (eucapnia), and, in the second, PETCO2 was clamped at 7-8 torr above resting PETCO2 (moderate hypercapnia). End-tidal PO2 was clamped at 100 Torr throughout except for two 2-min periods at 500 and 50 Torr. The ventilatory responses for each subject at each PO2 were fitted to the linear equation, VE = S(PETCO2 - B), where VE is minute ventilation, S is the response curve slope, and B is the response curve threshold. In eucapnia, there were no differences in hypoxic and hyperoxic VE between YS and OS. In hypercapnia, hypoxic VE was 24% lower in OS [39.93 +/- 2.71 (SE) l/min] than in YS (52.16 +/- 3.17 l/min). In hypoxia, S was significantly lower in OS (3.25 +/- 0.38 l.min…
4065261	Some characteristics of the human erythrocyte as a function of donor and cell age.	aging	1985-12-??	Erythrocytes from healthy human donors of various ages (18-93 years) were separated on Percoll into four density fractions. Increased cell density has been reported to correlate with the age of the erythrocyte. Aged individuals, while having normal hematocrits, show an increased percentage of low-density young erythrocytes and almost twice as many reticulocytes in their circulation as do young adults. This evidence for increased, well-compensated, red cell turnover in elderly humans is supported by the finding in older individuals of increased levels of erythrocytes bearing autologous IgG on their membranes. Using fluorescent anti-IgG, erythrocytes with bound autologous IgG could be found in all density fractions from donors of all age groups. The old donors had an increased number of fluorescent cells that appeared in all density fractions albeit with a definite skewing toward the more dense cell fractions. Erythrocytes from young donors had higher levels of intact hemoglobin per cell…
12954489	Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism in centenarians: different allele frequencies between the North and South of Europe.	longevity	2003-09-??	Variants of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 1 (ACE1) gene and the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) have been suggested to be associated with human longevity. We tested the association between the ACE1 insertion (I allele)/deletion (D allele) polymorphism and longevity in a population from Southern Italy and examined the impact of geographical variation on ACE1 allele frequencies on reported associations from other European countries. ACE1 and APOE genotypes were obtained on 82 centenarians and 252 middle-aged, unrelated subjects or volunteers. No statistically significant differences were found in ACE1 genotype or allele frequencies between centenarians and controls in this Southern Italian population nor was there any observed interaction with APOE alleles that are also reputed to be linked to longevity. However, decreasing gradients in ACE1*I allele frequencies, both in centenarians and controls, with concomitant increases in ACE1*D allele frequencies (partic…
9478023	Age-related sarcopenia in humans is associated with reduced synthetic rates of specific muscle proteins.	aging	1998-??-??	Sarcopenia of aging is not explained entirely on the basis of age-associated reduced physical activity. Progressive neuromuscular changes and diminishing anabolic hormone levels are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. Decline in muscle mass indicates a decline in muscle protein content. Recent studies demonstrated an age-related decline in synthesis rate of mixed muscle proteins, myosin heavy chain and mitochondrial protein. Reductions in myosin heavy chain and mitochondrial protein synthesis rates have been correlated with age-associated decrements in muscle strength and aerobic exercise tolerance, respectively. These changes have been reported as early as 50 y of age and are related to the decline in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate. The declining ability to remodel these important muscle proteins may therefore play a role in the development of muscle wasting, metabolic abnormalities and impaired physical …
20968370	Longitudinal changes in hearing sensitivity among men: the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study.	aging	2010-10-??	Over 35 years (1962-1996), participants of the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS), a study of healthy aging in men, completed up to eight audiometric assessments. This report describes the age-related hearing trajectories of screened men (n=953) aged 23 to 81 years at enrollment, estimates the typical rate of change per decade in hearing sensitivity, and compares longitudinal and cross-sectional estimates of change in hearing sensitivity. The men were followed 14 years on average. The hearing trajectories, based on a mixed-effects model analytical approach to the data, provide converging evidence that hearing loss in aging is pervasive and progressive even among men initially selected for good physical health. Typically the men accrued early losses (>25 dB HL) in hearing sensitivity at the higher frequencies beginning in the early 40s, but maintained hearing thresholds better than 25 dB HL for lower frequencies into old age. The average rate of change per year across frequenc…
26297464	In vivo confocal Raman microspectroscopy of the human skin: highlighting of spectral markers associated to aging via a research of correlation between Raman and biometric mechanical measurements.	aging	2015-11-??	Skin plays a protective role against the loss of water and external aggression, including mechanical stresses. These crucial functions are ensured by different cutaneous layers, particularly the stratum corneum (SC). During aging, the human skin reveals some apparent modifications of functionalities such as a loss of elasticity. Our investigations aimed at demonstrating that Raman microspectroscopy, as a label-free technique with a high molecular specificity, is efficient to assess in vivo the molecular composition of the skin and the alterations underwent during aging. Our approach was based on a search for correlation between Raman data collected on healthy female volunteers of different ages (from 21 to 70 years old) by means of a remote confocal Raman and skin firmness measurements used as a reference method. Raman and biometric data were then submitted to a partial least square (PLS)-based data processing. Our experiments demonstrated the potential of Raman microspectroscopy to pr…
6698405	Examination of the energetics of aging skeletal muscle using nuclear magnetic resonance.	aging	1984-??-??	Human skeletal muscle has been studied in vivo by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. Young adult subjects were compared with healthy elderly subjects aged 70-80 years. Intracellular pH and concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate were measured. At rest, no differences were found between the two age groups. Aerobic dynamic exercise resulted in a similar reduction of phosphocreatine in both groups while the ATP concentration did not change. The pH fall in exercise was not significantly different in the elderly and younger subjects. The time to resynthesize ATP in the recovery period as measured by the time to replete phosphocreatine was also not different in the two groups. The results suggest that the aging process does not affect the metabolic ability of human skeletal muscle to respond to exercise and that changes found in muscle of the elderly are not due to alterations in energy production.
14572526	Neuroanatomical correlates of selected executive functions in middle-aged and older adults: a prospective MRI study.	aging	2003-??-??	Neuroanatomical substrates of age-related differences in working memory and perseverative behavior were examined in a sample of healthy adults (50-81 years old). The participants, who were screened for history of neurological, psychiatric, and medical conditions known to be linked to poor cognitive performance, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were administered tests of working memory and perseveration. Regional brain volumes and the volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were measured on magnetic resonance images. The analyses indicate that the volume of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the volume of white matter hyperintensities in the prefrontal region are independently associated with age-related increases in perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). When participants taking antihypertensive medication were excluded from the analysis, both the volume of the prefrontal cortex and the frontal white matter hyperintensities (FWMH) still predict…
10363787	Age-related impairment of p56lck and ZAP-70 activities in human T lymphocytes activated through the TcR/CD3 complex.	aging	1999-04-??	Cellular immune responses decrease with aging. Lymphocytes of aged individuals do not perform as well as cells from young subjects in a number of in vitro assays including cell proliferation, cytokine production, and protection against apoptosis. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that a decrease in T cell responses in tymphocytes from elderly subjects could parallel a decrease in the activity of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) associated with signal transduction in T lymphocytes. We report that anti-CD3-triggered T lymphocyte proliferation was significantly decreased in T lymphocytes from elderly subjects, but the decrease was not due to an alteration of the percentage or mean fluorescence intensities of CD3, CD4, and CD45. Of significance, the activities of p56lck and ZAP-70 in vitro were significantly decreased in T lymphocytes from elderly subjects compared to young individuals. However, the level of expression of the two kinases did not change with aging. The activity of p59fyn di…
16023041	Taking an "intentional stance" on eye-gaze shifts: a functional neuroimaging study of social perception in children.	aging	2005-08-01	During middle childhood, children develop an increasing understanding of intentions and other social information conveyed through dynamic facial cues such as changes in eye-gaze direction. Recent work in our laboratory has focused on using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adults to map the neural circuitry subserving the visual analysis of others' actions and the intentions underlying these actions. In these studies, the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region has been continually implicated in processing shifts in eye gaze. Further, these studies have indicated that STS activity is modulated by the context within which eye-gaze shifts occur, suggesting that this region is involved in social perception via its role in the analysis of the intentions of observed actions. Still, no studies have investigated the neural circuitry supporting eye-gaze processing in children. We used event-related fMRI to examine brain activity in 7- to 10-year-old healthy children observing an an…
11909683	Reduced susceptibility to peroxidation of erythrocyte plasma membranes from centenarians.	longevity, aging	2002-05-??	The plasma membrane composition affects intracellular processes and the cellular susceptibility to free radical attack, which has been associated with the impairment of cellular functions occurring during senescence. The study of the modifications of the plasma membrane in centenarians might elucidate the biological mechanisms at the basis of longevity and successful aging. The work was performed in 190 subjects, divided into five groups according to the age range: (1) 21-40 years (n=25); (2) 41-60 years (n=30); (3) 61-80 years (n=30); (4) 81-99 years (n=50); and (5) centenarians (> or = 100 years) (n=55). The following determinations were performed on erythrocyte membranes: (i) the lipid peroxide level (Lp) evaluated as malondialdehyde content; (ii) susceptibility to in vitro oxidation evaluated as difference in the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances before and after phenylhydrazine addition; (iii) unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio and individual polyunsaturated f…
7555918	Aging, caffeine, and information processing: an event-related potential analysis.	aging	1995-09-??	Structural and energetic processes in information processing were studied in young and elderly subjects. A visually focussed selective search task was used, in which subjects had to select relevant information, followed by controlled memory search processes to locate a target item. Caffeine was used to manipulate the energetic state of the subjects. During task performance event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction time (RT) were recorded. Subjects were 15 young and 15 elderly healthy, non-smoking, moderate caffeine consumers (250-600 mg/day). Before the experimental sessions they abstained from caffeine for > or = 12 h. In the experiment subjects received 250 mg caffeine or placebo dissolved in decaffeinated coffee. RT data seem to indicate that aging effects are at least partly due to a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off. ERP results provide evidence for decreased levels of energy resources in the elderly. The identification of relevant information and stimulus evaluation proces…
7819377	Probing the conformation of protein (bFGF) precipitates by fluorescence spectroscopy.	aging	1994-08-??	Aggregation and precipitation are major events in the handling and aging of most protein pharmaceuticals. We demonstrate the utility of fluorescence spectroscopy in determining protein conformation in precipitates using basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as an example. Conversion of the native to the soluble denatured from by chaotropes was accompanied by an increase in tryptophan emission. The emission spectra of resuspended precipitates were as reproducible as the spectra of the soluble form. The sum of emission spectra of native soluble bFGF and denatured precipitated bFGF was superimposable on the spectrum of the unfractionated suspension, suggesting that quantitative analysis of denatured aggregates in turbid protein formulations is possible. The ratio of tryptophan to tyrosine emissions increased with increasing extent of denaturation both in solution and in suspension. For example, salting out by ammonium sulphate increased the fluorescence index (indicative of denaturation) …
15020306	Ascorbic acid does not affect large elastic artery compliance or central blood pressure in young and older men.	aging	2004-04-??	Large elastic artery compliance is reduced and arterial blood pressure (BP) is increased in the central (cardiothoracic) circulation with aging. Reactive oxygen species may tonically modulate central arterial compliance and BP in humans, and oxidative stress may contribute to adverse changes with aging. If so, antioxidant administration may have beneficial effects. Young (Y; 26 +/- 1 yr, mean +/- SE) and older (O; 63 +/- 2 yr, mean +/- SE) healthy men were studied at baseline and during acute (intravenous infusion; Y: n = 13, O: n = 12) and chronic (500 mg/day for 30 days; Y: n = 10, O: n = 10) administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). At baseline, peripheral (brachial artery) BP did not differ in the two groups, but carotid artery compliance was 43% lower (1.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.1 mm(2)/mmHg x 10(-1), P < 0.01) and central (carotid) BP (systolic: 116 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.05, and pulse pressure: 43 +/- 4 vs. 36 +/- 3 mmHg, P = 0.16), carotid augmentation index (AIx; 27…
6345585	Characterization of the insulin resistance of aging.	aging	1983-06-??	To clarify the nature of the insulin resistance of aging we studied the dose response for insulin-induced glucose disposal and the binding of insulin to circulating monocytes in healthy young and old men. A total of 49 two-hour euglycemic insulin clamp studies were performed in 17 young and 10 old healthy nonobese subjects. While the old group had lower estimates of lean body mass and greater estimates of total body fat than the young group, these differences did not exceed 5% and did not reach statistical significance. Insulin was infused at 20 mU/m2 per min (young = 8, old = 5); 80 mU/m2 per min (young = 13, old = 9); 200 mU/m2 per min (young = 9, old = 5). Increasing levels of hyperinsulinemia were associated with dose-dependent increases in steady-state glucose infusion rates in young and old. The maximal glucose infusion rates (milligrams per kilogram body weight per minute) were the same for young and old. However, the dose-response curve was shifted to the right in the old subje…
27049451	The Moderating Effect of Frequent Singing on Voice Aging.	aging	2017-01-??	The effects of aging on voice production are well documented, including changes in loudness, pitch, and voice quality. However, one important and clinically relevant question that remains concerns the possibility that the aging of voice can be prevented or at least delayed through noninvasive methods. Indeed, discovering natural means to preserve the integrity of the human voice throughout aging could have a major impact on the quality of life of elderly adults. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the potentially positive effect of singing on voice production. To this aim, a group of 72 healthy nonsmoking adults (20-93 years old) was recruited and separated into three groups based on their singing habits. Several voice parameters were assessed (fundamental frequency [f0] mean, f0 standard deviation [SD], f0 minimum and f0 maximum, mean amplitude and amplitude SD, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio) during the sustained production of vowel /a/. Other parameter…
25119708	Anatomical region differences and age-related changes in copper, zinc, and manganese levels in the human brain.	aging	2014-11-??	Using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after samples microwave-assisted acid digestion, zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) levels were measured in 14 different areas of the human brain of adult individuals (n = 42; 71 ± 12, range 50-101 years old) without a known history of neurodegenerative, neurological, or psychiatric disorder. The main goals of the work were to establish the "normal" (reference) values for those elements in the human brain and to evaluate the age-related changes, a prior and indispensable step in order to enlighten the role of trace element (TE) in human brain physiology and their involvement in aging and neurodegenerative processes. Considering the mean values for the 14 regions, Zn (mean ± sd; range 53 ± 5; 43-61 μg/g) was found at higher levels, followed by Cu (22 ± 5; 10-37 μg/g) and Mn (1.3 ± 0.3; 0.5-2.7 μg/g). The TE distribution across the brain tissue showed to be quite heterogeneous: the highest levels of Zn were found in the hippocamp…
20541818	Receptors and aging: structural selectivity of the rhamnose-receptor on fibroblasts as shown by Ca(2+)-mobilization and gene-expression profiles.	aging	????-??-??	Qualitative and quantitative modifications of receptors were shown to play a key role in cell and tissue aging. We recently described the properties of a rhamnose-recognizing receptor on fibroblasts involved in the mediation of age-dependent functions of these cells. Using Ca(2+)-mobilization and DNA-microarrays we could show in the presence of rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides (RROPs) Ca(2+)-mobilization and changes in gene regulation. Here, we compared the effects of several RROPs, differing in their carbohydrate sequence and molecular weights, in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). It appeared that different structural features were required for maximal effects on Ca(2+)-mobilization and gene-expression profiles. Maximal effect on Ca(2+) influx and intracellular free calcium regulation was exhibited by RROP-1, a 50 kDa average molecular weight polysaccharide, and RROP-3, a 5 kDa average molecular weight oligosaccharide with a different carbohydrate sequence. Maximal effe…
28028686	Biomarkers of chondriome topology and function: implications for the extension of healthy aging.	aging	2017-??-??	Multiple theories of aging (e.g., free radical, error catastrophe, mitochondrial) are complementary but fail to provide adequate models that comprehensively predict lifelong aging processes and that are valid across species. Hayflick (PLoS Genet 3(12):2351-2354, 2007) described six universal characteristics of aging that focus upon post-reproductive molecular entropy. Here we present a thermodynamic potential model of aging in which the energetic and topological properties of the mitochondrion drive functional and structural stabilities within living systems. Using multivariate regressions of physiological assessments from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, VO max consistently declined with age regardless of gender or race, although it had a significantly greater decline for African American females. Percent fat (negative), hematocrit (negative), and urine creatinine (negative) were strongly and significantly associated with VO max and male aging, although cholestero…
19682549	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle: effects of exercise and aging.	aging	2010-03-??	Acute contractile activity of skeletal muscle initiates the activation of signaling kinases. This promotes the phosphorylation of transcription factors, leading to enhanced DNA binding and transcriptional activation and/or repression. The mRNA products of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol and imported into pre-existing mitochondria. When contractile activity is repeated, the recapitulation of these cellular events progressively leads to an expansion of the mitochondrial reticulum within muscle. This has physiologically relevant health benefit, including enhanced lipid metabolism and reduced muscle fatigability. In aging skeletal muscle, the response to contractile activity appears to be attenuated, suggesting that a greater contractile stimulus is required to attain a similar phenotype adaptation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the effects of exercise on the gene expression pathway leading to organelle biogenesis in muscle.
19427909	Cerebral control of the lower urinary tract: how age-related changes might predispose to urge incontinence.	aging	2009-09-??	Loss of bladder control (urge incontinence) is common in elderly; the cause is usually unknown. Functional imaging has revealed the brain network controlling responses to bladder filling. Age-related changes in this network might predispose to urge incontinence. We sought such changes in 10 continent, healthy women aged 30-79 years who underwent fMRI while fluid (approximately 20 ml) was repeatedly infused into and withdrawn from the bladder. Data were collected in 4 measurement blocks with progressively increasing bladder volumes and were analyzed by SPM2, using the contrast infuse-withdraw to quantify response to bladder infusion. Effective connectivity was examined by physiophysiological interaction (PhPI; see interpretation in Supplementary Material), with right insula (RI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as seed regions. Dependence on age and bladder volume (= block number) was assessed. Bladder infusion evoked expected activations. Activation decreased with age in bil…
26108562	The role of nitric oxide in passive leg movement-induced vasodilatation with age: insight from alterations in femoral perfusion pressure.	lifespan	2015-09-01	The passive leg movement (PLM) model is a novel approach to assess vascular function. Increasing femoral perfusion pressure (FPP) by moving from the supine to the upright-seated posture augments the vasodilatory response to PLM in the young, with no effect in the old, but whether this augmented vasodilatation is nitric oxide (NO) dependent is unknown. Using an intra-arterial infusion of N(G) -monomethyl-L -arginine (L -NMMA) to inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the posture-induced increases in the PLM responses in the young were nearly ablated, with no effect of NOS inhibition in the old. Therefore, PLM in combination with alterations in posture can be used to determine changes in NO-mediated vasodilatation with age, and thus, may be a clinically useful tool for assessing NO bioavailability across the human lifespan. We sought to better understand the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to passive leg movement (PLM)-induced vasodilatation with age, with and without a posture-induced i…
21541735	Midlife muscle strength and human longevity up to age 100 years: a 44-year prospective study among a decedent cohort.	longevity, aging	2012-06-??	We studied prospectively the midlife handgrip strength, living habits, and parents' longevity as predictors of length of life up to becoming a centenarian. The participants were 2,239 men from the Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu-Asia Aging Study who were born before the end of June 1909 and who took part in baseline physical assessment in 1965-1968, when they were 56-68 years old. Deaths were followed until the end of June 2009 for 44 years with complete ascertainment. Longevity was categorized as centenarian (≥100 years, n = 47), nonagenarian (90-99 years, n = 545), octogenarian (80-89 years, n = 847), and ≤79 years (n = 801, reference). The average survival after baseline was 20.8 years (SD = 9.62). Compared with people who died at the age of ≤79 years, centenarians belonged 2.5 times (odds ratio (OR) = 2.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23-5.10) more often to the highest third of grip strength in midlife, were never smokers (OR = 5.75 95% CI = 3.06-10.80), had participated in ph…
11735098	Exercise-induced oxidative stress in older adults as measured by antipyrine oxidation.	aging	2001-12-??	Aging is associated with increased susceptibility to free radical-mediated tissue damage. Measuring exercise-induced oxidative stress, however, is a major problem in free radical research. We used an exogenous marker (antipyrine) to measure oxidative stress in older adults during submaximal exercise. Antipyrine pharmacokinetics is independent of blood flow to the liver. Furthermore, antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals (10(10)-10(11) L x mol(-1) x s(-1)) to form para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine (o-APOH). o-APOH is not formed in man through the mono-oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450. Thirty-four subjects (62 +/- 1 years) orally ingested 10 mg antipyrine/kg body mass. One hour after ingestion subjects cycled 45 minutes at 50% maximal power output. Exercise significantly increased the ratio of para-hydroxyantipyrine (p-APOH) to native antipyrine in plasma (.0014 +/-.0001 v.0021 +/-.0002; P <.0001). Also, the ratio of o-APOH was significantly increased after exercise (.0014…
10601162	Skeletal muscle metabolism during short-term, high-intensity exercise in prepubertal and pubertal girls.	aging	1999-12-??	To test the hypothesis that glycolytic metabolism in muscle is attenuated in prepubertal children, (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine calf muscle intracellular pH (pH(i)) in nine prepubertal (Pre) and nine pubertal female swimmers (Pub). Maximal plantar flexion work capacity (100% MWC) was established by using a graded exercise test. Between 5 and 10 days later, calf muscle images (magnetic resonance imaging) and phosphorus spectra were acquired at rest, during 2 min of light exercise (40% MWC), and during 2 min of supramaximal exercise (140% MWC) in a 3.0-T NMR system. End-exercise pH(i) was 6.66 +/- 0.11 and 6.76 +/- 0.17 for Pub and Pre, respectively. No significant differences in the mean values for pH(i) or the P(i)-to-phosphocreatine ratio were observed between groups during the protocol; however, an interaction effect was found for the P(i)-to-phosphocreatine ratio during the supramaximal exercise challenge. Cross-sectional area of gastrocnemius was 15.1…
25772792	Preserved motor asymmetry in late adulthood: is measuring chronological age enough?	aging	2015-05-21	When comparing motor performance of the dominant and nondominant hands, older adults tend to be less asymmetric compared to young adults. This has suggested decreased motor lateralization and functional compensation within the aging brain. The current study further addressed this question by testing whether motor asymmetry was reduced in a sample of 44 healthy right-handed adults ages 65-89. We hypothesized that the older the age, the less the motor asymmetry, and that 'old old' participants (age 80+) would have less motor asymmetry than 'young old' participants (age 65-79). Using two naturalistic tasks that selectively biased the dominant or nondominant hands, we compared asymmetries in performance (measured as a ratio) across chronological age. Results showed preserved motor asymmetry across ages in both tasks, with no difference in asymmetry ratios in the 'old old' compared to the 'young old.' In the context of previous work, our findings suggest that the aging brain may also be cha…
10760294	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, and aging: contribution of the DHEAge Study to a sociobiomedical issue.	aging	2000-04-11	The secretion and the blood levels of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS) decrease profoundly with age, and the question is posed whether administration of the steroid to compensate for the decline counteracts defects associated with aging. The commercial availability of DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded. Besides the reestablishment of a "young" concentration of DHEAS, a small increase of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-cli…
21316037	A review of functional brain imaging correlates of successful cognitive aging.	aging	2011-07-15	Preserved cognitive performance is a key feature of successful aging. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the putative underlying relationship between brain function and performance. We aimed to review imaging studies of the association between brain functional response and cognitive performance among healthy younger and older adults to understand the neural correlates of successful cognitive aging. MEDLINE-indexed articles published between January 1989 and December 2009 and bibliographies of these articles and related reviews were searched. Studies that measured brain function with functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography, evaluated cognitive performance, analyzed how cognitive performance related to brain response, and studied healthy older individuals were included. Eighty of 550 articles met these criteria. Seventy percent of the studies reported some brain regions in which greater activation related to better cognitive performance…
19435952	No association between telomere length and blood cell counts in elderly individuals.	aging	2009-09-??	BACKGROUND: Telomeres play a crucial role in maintaining the physical integrity of chromosomes. Telomere length (TL) is severely reduced in individuals with dyskeratosis congenita and a number of other bone marrow failure syndromes. The TL of healthy individuals is highly variable, but shortens with age. It is presently unclear if variations in TL observed in normal aging individuals affect significantly their hematopoietic reserve. Method We studied the correlation between leukocyte age-adjusted TL (aTL) and blood cell parameters (total leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, and platelets) in a large cohort (n=717) of women aged 38-100 years. Result We did not find any significant correlation between aTL and blood counts.    CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the aTL of aging individuals is not significantly predictive of their hematopoietic reserve, which implies that TL measurement may not be clinically useful in the selection of hematopoietic stem …
16498698	Long-lived yeast as a model for ageing research.	longevity, lifespan	2006-02-??	Yeast has essentially two lifespans: a replicative lifespan (the number of daughters produced by each dividing mother cell) and a chronological lifespan (the capacity of stationary (G0) cultures to maintain viability over time). There is a tendency now to label every investigation that addresses these lifespans as ageing research. It is, though, analyses of the longest lifespans that will be most informative about the determinants of longevity and yield results most relevant to ageing in more complex systems. This review addresses these issues and describes the ongoing studies that are now attempting to address ageing in yeast cells of maximal replicative or chronological longevity.
16805927	Remembering to age successfully: evaluation of a successful aging approach to memory enhancement.	aging	2007-02-??	BACKGROUND: Memory enhancement programs that can significantly improve actual memory performance and subjective perceptions of everyday memory in elderly people are rare. This study was designed to evaluate a new memory enhancement program incorporating principles of successful aging, designed to enhance subjective and objective everyday memory in community-dwelling old people.    METHODS: Two matched groups of 20 healthy community-dwelling elderly adults were assessed on measures of objective and subjective memory performance before and after participating in a memory enhancement or active control condition.    RESULTS: Planned multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on change scores showed that participants in the memory enhancement program improved significantly on both objective and subjective measures. Specifically, greater improvement was demonstrated on a verbal paired associates task, story recall, face recognition, contentment with memory, and use of memory strategies.    C…
23433536	Silicon absorption and excretion is independent of age and sex in adults.	aging	2013-09-28	Host factors influencing the absorption and excretion of Si are poorly understood, although previous murine and human studies have suggested that age, sex and oestrogen status may affect Si metabolism and thus function. Here, serum and urine samples were collected from twenty-six healthy adults at baseline and over a 6 h period following ingestion of 17·4mg Si (orthosilicic acid) and analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Fasting baseline serum and urinary Si concentrations were marginally higher in older adults (51-66 years old) compared with young adults (20-47 years old); however, there was no difference in the absorption of Si into serum (overall profile, rate of Si appearance, peak concentration and time to peak) between the different adult groups. The rate of elimination of Si from serum did not significantly differ with age or sex, although serum concentration at 6 h was higher in older adults and significantly correlated with age (r 0·5; P=0·01). …
1689869	Stability of DNA methylation of X-chromosome genes during aging.	aging	1990-01-??	The stability of DNA methylation during aging was assessed in two groups of young (5-20 years old) and old (85-95 years old) women in DNA from blood leukocytes. Three X-linked genes were investigated. Two, G6PD and GdX, are located on Xq28, on the inactivated portion of the X chromosome: demethylation of specific regions of both genes was shown previously to be directly correlated with gene reactivation. The third, MIC2, is located on the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome and escapes X inactivation. The 5' region of the G6PD and GdX genes and the body of the G6PD, GDX, and MIC2 genes were analyzed with specific DNA probes. No age-related changes in methylation pattern were detected. We can conclude therefore that the methylation pattern of the three X-linked genes is stable during aging in female leukocytes and that a high rate of age-related reactivation of X-linked genes may not be a feature of all X-linked loci.
12902414	Correction for partial-volume effects on brain perfusion SPECT in healthy men.	aging	2003-08-??	UNLABELLED: The limited spatial resolution of SPECT scanners does not allow an exact measurement of the local radiotracer concentration in brain tissue because partial-volume effects (PVEs) underestimate concentration in small structures of the brain. The aim of this study was to determine which brain structures show greater influence of PVEs in SPECT studies on healthy volunteers and to investigate aging effects on SPECT after the PVE correction.    METHODS: Brain perfusion SPECT using (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer was performed in 52 healthy men, 18-86 y old. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was noninvasively measured using graphical analysis. SPECT images were corrected for PVEs using gray-matter volume, which was segmented from coregistered MR images and convoluted with spatial resolution of SPECT scanners. Absolute rCBF data were measured using a 3-dimensional (3D) stereotactic template for regions of interest on anatomically standardized SPECT. We examined correlation of a…
7790936	Regional cerebral function determined by FDG-PET in healthy volunteers: normal patterns and changes with age.	aging	1995-07-??	UNLABELLED: The main objective of this study was to determine patterns of regional brain metabolic activity utilizing high-resolution PET in normal healthy volunteers and variations in different age groups.    METHODS: High-resolution [18F]FDG PET images of the entire brain were obtained in 120 healthy normal volunteers (64 men, 56 women), age range from 19 to 79 yr. Each anatomic region was assessed using a qualitative rating scale with a score ranging from 1 to 6 (1 = definitely normal and 6 = definitely abnormal). Local metabolic activity was also estimated as showing increased (+) or decreased (-) compared to normal (0) states.    RESULTS: The most consistent finding in normal aging was decreased cortical metabolism, particularly in the frontal lobes. Temporal, parietal and occipital lobe metabolism varied considerably among subjects within the same age group as well as over decades. Basal ganglia, hippocampal area, thalami, cerebellum, posterior cingulate gyrus and visual cortex r…
24258198	Decomposing social capital inequalities in health.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: Research has shown network social capital associated with a range of health behaviours and conditions. Little is known about what social capital inequalities in health represent, and which social factors contribute to such inequalities.    METHODS: Data come from the Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging Study (n=2707). A position generator was used to collect network data on social capital. Health outcomes included self-reported health (SRH), physical inactivity, and hypertension. Social capital inequalities in low SRH, physical inactivity, and hypertension were decomposed into demographic, socioeconomic, network and psychosocial determinants. The percentage contributions of each in explaining health disparities were calculated.    RESULTS: Across the three outcomes, higher educational attainment contributed most consistently to explaining social capital inequalities in low SRH (% C=30.8%), physical inactivity (15.9%), and hypertension (51.2%). Social isolation…
29921951	Effect of age on the morphologies of the human Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork measured with swept‑source optical coherence tomography.	aging	2018-??-??	PURPOSE: We aimed to measure the sizes of Schlemm's canal (SC) and the trabecular meshwork (TM) in healthy individuals and to evaluate variations with age from childhood to old age by using swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT).    METHODS: Anterior chamber angle imaging of the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal regions of the right and left eyes was performed with swept-source OCT. The diameter and area of SC and TM width and thickness were measured manually from OCT images.    RESULTS: A total of 114 healthy individuals were enrolled and included 48 male subjects and 66 female subjects; their ages ranged from 7 to 83 years. Both the SC diameter and area in the four quadrants decreased significantly with aging (P < 0.001) and were wider in the nasal and temporal quadrants compared with the superior and inferior quadrants. Changes in SC size showed significant positive correlations with axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (P < 0.001). There was a significant pos…
30698207	Genes related to maintenance of autophagy and successful aging.	aging	2018-??-??	Considering aging as a phenomenon in which there is a decline in essential processes for cell survival, we investigated the autophagic and proteasome pathways in three different groups: young, older and oldest old male adults. The expression profile of autophagic pathway-related genes was carried out in peripheral blood, and the proteasome quantification was performed in plasma. No significant changes were found in plasma proteasome concentrations or in correlations between proteasome concentrations and ages. However, some autophagy- and/or apoptosis-related genes were differentially expressed. In addition, the network and enrichment analysis showed an interaction between four of the five differentially expressed genes and an association of these genes with the transcriptional process. Considering that the oldest old individuals maintained both the expression of genes linked to the autophagic machinery, and the proteasome levels, when compared with the older group, we concluded that th…
24099860	Diurnal profiles of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase change across the adult lifespan: evidence from repeated daily life assessments.	lifespan	2013-12-??	Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase are known to have distinctive diurnal profiles. However, little is known about systematic changes in these biomarkers across the adult lifespan. In a study of 185 participants (aged 20-81 years), time-stamped salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase were collected 7 times/day over 10 days. Samples were taken upon waking, 30 min later, and then approximately every 3 h until 9 pm. Multilevel models showed that older age was associated with increased daily cortisol secretion as indicated by greater area under the curve, attenuated wake-evening slopes, and more pronounced cortisol awakening responses. Further, older age was related to greater daily alpha-amylase output and attenuated wake-evening slopes. No age differences were observed regarding the alpha-amylase awakening response. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of age-related differences in functioning of stress-related systems.
23906007	Antioxidant capacity of water soluble extracts from Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.	aging	2013-12-??	In this work the antioxidant capacity of water soluble extracts of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (Water Soluble Extracts - WSEs) at different aging time was studied, by measuring their radical scavenging capacity with a standard ABTS assay. The WSEs were also fractionated by semi-preparative HPLC-UV and for each fraction the antioxidant capacity and the molecular composition was determined by LC/ESI-MS, in order to identify the most active antioxidant compounds. The antioxidant capacity was also determined after simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of WSEs. The data indicated that antioxidant capacity in WSE from Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, quite unaffected by ripening time and gastrointestinal digestion, is mostly due to free amino acids, mainly tyrosine, methionine and tryptophan, and only in minimal part to antioxidant peptides.
3582505	Detection of the cross-linking amino acid, histidinoalanine, in human brown cataractous lens protein.	aging	1987-02-??	In human nuclear cataract, with its progression, high polymers protein mass, which is aggregated and strengthened by disulfide cross-links and other covalent cross-links, accumulates in the nuclear region to cause hardening of the lens nucleus. However, the structure of non-disulfide covalent cross-links has not been clearly confirmed yet. Recently a cross-linking amino acid, histidinoalanine, was discovered in connective tissue and is thought to cause hardening of the tissue with aging. The content of this amino acid in the lens nucleus was studied. Nuclear cataract was classified on the basis of nuclear color as described by Pirie (1986). The content of histidinoalanine was found to be 0.05 +/- 0.03 nmol mg-1 in normal nucleus; 0.06 +/- 0.03 nmol mg-1 in grade I (uniform pale yellow); 0.05 +/- 0.03 nmol mg-1 in grade II (deep yellow nucleus); 0.38 +/- 0.07 nmol mg-1 (P less than 0.01) in grade III (hazel-brown nucleus) and 3.35 +/- 2.76 nmol mg-1 (P less than 0.01) in grade IV (deep …
7066961	A re-evaluation of the changes in proliferation in human fibroblasts during ageing in vitro.	lifespan	1982-03-??	Previously published studies concerning the proliferative changes, during ageing in vitro, of human embryonic fibroblasts, have been reappraised. The data suggest that the changes occur through shifts in a whole spectrum of cells between two extremes: complete inhibition and a normal division cycle. Reversion from the non-dividing to the dividing state becomes increasingly difficult and random. Ageing is the result of a long chain of events that hinder the transit of cells through the division cycle, mainly through interference with the G1 but also with the G2 period. Some metabolic events at the very end of the lifespan could support the terminal differentiation hypothesis.
529839	Differences between transfer RNA methylase activity in human diploid fibroblasts during in vitro and in vivo aging.	aging	1979-12-??	The change of the specific activity of S-adenosylmethionine: tRNA methyltransferase in cultures of human diploid fibroblasts at different passages has been measured and compared with that in the same type of cells derived from donors of different ages. Whereas the specific activity of tRNA methylase in the in vitro aged cells was found to decline gradually with increasing passage number of the culture, a different activity--age relationship was observed for this enzyme in cells derived from donors of different ages. The activity of tRNA methylase is high in the fetal cells and drops drastically in the "newborn" cells. After a further 10% decline, the activity of this enzyme reaches a steady low level in the postnatal cells from donors ranging in age from 3 months to 94 years. These findings cast doubt on the validity of the assumption that the results obtained from in vitro aging experiments reflect the biochemistry of aging in vivo. The "fetal" enzyme can methylate the "aged" tRNA but…
3009476	Glycerated hemoglobin, alpha 2A beta 2(82) (EF6) N epsilon-glyceryllysine. A new post-translational modification occurring in erythrocyte bisphosphoglyceromutase deficiency.	aging	1986-05-25	A new minor Hb fraction initially designated Hbx, has been found in the hemolysate of an erythremic patient that we have previously described with a complete erythrocyte bisphosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.4) deficiency. Hbx (3.5% of the total) was detected by isoelectric focusing and exhibited electrophoretic and chromatographic properties similar to those of several variants of the Hb central cavity. By density fractionation of red cells, it was demonstrated that Hbx was an aging hemoglobin as in the case of glycated Hb A1c. Functional studies revealed a low oxygen affinity and almost complete inhibition of the allosteric effect of the organic phosphate effectors. Structural studies demonstrated an absence of tryptic cleavage between the peptides beta T9 and beta T10 suggesting the presence of an adduct on Lys beta 82 or on a neighboring residue. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and a specific enzymatic assay with glyoxylate reductase demonstrated that the beta 82 adduct was …
26488591	Reduction of Dual-task Costs by Noninvasive Modulation of Prefrontal Activity in Healthy Elders.	aging	2016-02-??	Dual tasking (e.g., walking or standing while performing a cognitive task) disrupts performance in one or both tasks, and such dual-task costs increase with aging into senescence. Dual tasking activates a network of brain regions including pFC. We therefore hypothesized that facilitation of prefrontal cortical activity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would reduce dual-task costs in older adults. Thirty-seven healthy older adults completed two visits during which dual tasking was assessed before and after 20 min of real or sham tDCS targeting the left pFC. Trials of single-task standing, walking, and verbalized serial subtractions were completed, along with dual-task trials of standing or walking while performing serial subtractions. Dual-task costs were calculated as the percent change in markers of gait and postural control and serial subtraction performance, from single to dual tasking. Significant dual-task costs to standing, walking, and serial subtraction perfor…
19486911	A potential impact of DNA repair on ageing and lifespan in the ageing model organism Podospora anserina: decrease in mitochondrial DNA repair activity during ageing.	lifespan	2009-08-??	The free radical theory of ageing states that ROS play a key role in age-related decrease in mitochondrial function via the damage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), proteins and lipids. In the sexually reproducing ascomycete Podospora anserina ageing is, as in other eukaryotes, associated with mtDNA instability and mitochondrial dysfunction. Part of the mtDNA instabilities may arise due to accumulation of ROS induced mtDNA lesions, which, as previously suggested for mammals, may be caused by an age-related decrease in base excision repair (BER). Alignments of known BER protein sequences with the P. anserina genome revealed high homology. We report for the first time the presence of BER activities in P. anserina mitochondrial extracts. DNA glycosylase activities decrease with age, suggesting that the increased mtDNA instability with age may be caused by decreased ability to repair mtDNA damage and hence contribute to ageing and lifespan control in this ageing model. Additionally, we find lo…
28144914	The "Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies" (SPRINTT) randomized controlled trial: design and methods.	aging	2017-02-??	The sustainability of health and social care systems is threatened by a growing population of older persons with heterogeneous needs related to multimorbidity, frailty, and increased risk of functional impairment. Since disability is difficult to reverse in old age and is extremely burdensome for individuals and society, novel strategies should be devised to preserve adequate levels of function and independence in late life. The development of mobility disability, an early event in the disablement process, precedes and predicts more severe forms of inability. Its prevention is, therefore, critical to impede the transition to overt disability. For this reason, the Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies (SPRINTT) project is conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test a multicomponent intervention (MCI) specifically designed to prevent mobility disability in high-risk older persons. SPRINTT is a phase III, multicenter RCT aimed at …
10659800	Effects of age and functional limitation on leg joint power and work during stance phase of gait.	aging	1999-07-??	It is commonly accepted that leg muscle power is an important component of functional ability. Paced gait data for 20 healthy young women (27+/-4.2 yrs), 16 healthy old women (72.5+/-5.6 yrs), and 24 functionally limited old women (73.5+/-7.2 yrs) were analyzed during stance phase to investigate whether power calculations from motion analysis data were sensitive to impairments beyond the differences expected with aging. Healthy women included in the study functioned at a high/moderate level with no limitations, while functionally limited women functioned at a much lower level and exhibited one or more functional limitations as defined by the SF36 physical function scale. Single support time (SSUP), stance duration (SDUR), average forward center of gravity velocity (GVEL), and three-dimensional net power and work of the ankle (APOW/AWRK), knee (KPOW/KWRK), and hip (HPOW/ HWRK) were computed for the stance limb during the stance phase of gait. Univariate ANCOVA was used to examine which …
27032428	Survival Advantage Mechanism: Inflammation as a Mediator of Positive Self-Perceptions of Aging on Longevity.	longevity, aging	2018-??-02	Objective: Previous studies have found that positive self-perceptions of aging (SPA) are associated with longer survival; however, a biological mechanism was unknown. We examined whether C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of cumulative stress-related inflammation, mediates the relationship between SPA and survival.    Method: The SPA of participants aged 50 and older in the Health and Retirement Study (N = 4,149) were assessed at baseline. Inflammation was measured by the level of CRP 4 years later. Survival was followed for up to 6 years.    Results: As hypothesized, CRP mediated the impact of SPA on survival. Following the steps of a mediation analysis, positive SPA at baseline predicted lower CRP after 4 years (β = -.29, p = .03) and longer survival in the 2 years following the CRP measurement (β = .20, p =.003); additionally, lower CRP predicted longer survival, after adjusting for positive SPA (β = -.02, p = .0001). All models adjusted for baseline age, CRP, health, sex, race, and…
10819308	Increase of oxidatively modified protein is associated with a decrease of proteasome activity and content in aging epidermal cells.	aging	2000-05-??	For the process of aging in epidermal cells to be characterized, the status of oxidized and damaged protein accumulation and removal by the proteasome has been investigated. Modified protein content and proteasome activity were assayed in lysates of epidermal cells from donors of different ages. Increased levels of oxidized proteins, glycated proteins, and proteins modified by the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal were observed in cells from old donors. At the same time, a decline of chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities of the proteasome was found in aging keratinocytes. This age-related decline of the proteasome peptidase activities can be explained, at least in part, by a decreased proteasome content as observed by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In keratinocyte cultures, a decrease of proteasome activity and content was observed upon serial passaging. In cultures, as well as in skin, an inverse relationship was found …
11352641	Gene profile of replicative senescence is different from progeria or elderly donor.	aging	2001-04-13	In vitro cellular senescence of human diploid fibroblast has been a good model for aging research, which shows similar phenotypes to in vivo aging. Gene expression profiling would provide an insight to understand the mechanism of senescence. Using cDNA microarray containing 384 known genes, we compared the expression profiles of three different types of aging models: replicative senescence, fibroblasts from progeria or from elderly donor. Although all of them showed senescence phenotypes, distinct sets of genes were altered in each group. Pairwise plots or cluster analysis of activation fold of gene expression revealed closer relationships between fibroblasts from progeria or from old individual, but not between replicative senescence fibroblasts and either models. Differential expression pattern of several genes were confirmed by RT-PCR. We suggest that the replicative senescence model might behave differently to other types of aging models due to the distinct gene expression.
1451251	Augmented forearm vasoconstriction during dynamic exercise in healthy older men.	aging	1992-12-??	BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the nonactive limb vasoconstriction evoked during large-muscle dynamic exercise becomes augmented with aging in humans.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen young control subjects (age, 26 +/- 1 year) and twelve older (65 +/- 1 year) healthy men with similar chronic physical activity levels were studied during supine leg cycling exercise. Both peak work load (1,100 +/- 60 versus 1,400 +/- 40 kpm/min) and peak O2 uptake (1.85 +/- 0.10 versus 2.38 +/- 0.07 l/min) were lower in the older men (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the two groups under conditions of quiet supine (basal) rest. During cycling for 5 minutes each at mild, moderate, and heavy submaximal intensities (approximately 45%, 65%, and 85% of peak O2 uptake), the increases in arterial blood pressure generally were similar in the young and older subjects; however, heart rate rose less in the older men (p < 0.05). Whole forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) was lower a…
10487697	Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate enhances natural killer cell cytotoxicity in humans via locally generated immunoreactive insulin-like growth factor I.	aging	1999-09-??	Experimental and clinical investigations suggest the hypothesis that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) can positively influence natural killer (NK) immunity via locally produced insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) from NK cells. In the present study, the NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and IGF-I levels in the supernatant of NK cells were studied at baseline and after exposure to various molar concentrations of DHEAS (from 10(-5)-10(-8) mol/L x mL/7.75 x 10(6) NK cells) in healthy subjects of young and old age. DHEAS-induced NKCC was also determined after DHEAS coincubation with somatostatin-14 (10-6) mol/L x mL/7.75 x 10(6) NK cells) and with interleukin-2 (IL-2; 100 IU/mL x 7.75 x 10(6) NK cells). NK cells were previously isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient and then by immunomagnetic procedure; the purity obtained was 97 +/- 1%. NKCC was determined against K562 tumoral targets. We observed that the increase in NKCC after DHEAS exposure was dose dependent and was correlated w…

In this study, 153 Italian centenarians from four different geographical areas, including Modena (northern Italy), Ancona (central Italy), Perugia (central Italy) and Sardinia island (AKEA Project) were enrolled. Plasma levels of vitamin C, uric acid, vitamin A and vitamin E as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured. Subjects were compared to a younger control population of the same areas, divided into three age groups: <or=60; 61-80 and 81-99 years. The main result of this study is that, whereas in Italian population elevated levels of plasma vitamins A and E seem to be important for longevity, this do not apply to centenarians from Sardinia, in which probably other factors play a more important role.
29658747	Is subjective memory change in old age based on accurate monitoring of age-related memory change? Evidence from two longitudinal studies.	aging	2018-??-??	Subjective memory change (SMC) in adulthood involves the perception that one's memory has declined from earlier levels of function. SMC has been conjectured to be more accurate than concurrent subjective memory because people use themselves as a standard of comparison. We used data from two longitudinal studies to contrast the accurate-monitoring-of-change hypothesis-actual memory change predicts SMC-against a constructed-judgment hypothesis that rated SMC is a function of rescaling concurrent memory beliefs without accessing actual memory change. It states that actual memory change has no predictive validity for SMC independent of concurrent memory beliefs. Data from both the Berlin Aging Study and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) showed that older adults' current memory complaints strongly predicted current SMC, and that there was little relationship of longitudinally measured memory change to SMC, controlling on memory complaints. In the HRS there were reliable latent-growth-cu…
27338978	Exercise prescription for the older population: The interactions between physical activity, sedentary time, and adequate nutrition in maintaining musculoskeletal health.	aging	2016-11-??	Regular physical activity (PA) promotes musculoskeletal health in older adults. However, the majority of older individuals do not meet current PA guidelines and are also highly sedentary. Emerging evidence indicates that large amounts of sedentary time accelerate the loss of skeletal muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) and physical function with advancing age. However, current PA recommendations for sedentary time are non-specific (i.e., keep sedentary time to a minimum). Research indicates that physical inactivity and large amounts of sedentary time accelerate sarcopenic muscle loss by inducing skeletal muscle 'anabolic resistance'. These findings suggest a critical interaction between engaging in 'sufficient' levels of PA, minimising sedentary time, and consuming 'adequate' nutrition to promote optimal musculoskeletal health in older adults. However, current PA recommendations do not take into account the important role that nutrition plays in ensuring older adults can maximise the benefi…
22273454	Neuroendocrinology and ovarian aging.	aging	2012-03-??	The ovarian aging, a dynamic process that precedes the clinical manifestations of menopause, can be assessed using ovarian reserve biomarkers. It is well-known that reproduction during the later years of reproductive life has known limitations that challenge the success of assisted reproduction. Therefore, a review of the neuroendocrine modifications during this critical period of reproductive life may help to elucidate the ovarian aging process and its impact on reproduction. In this review, we aim to further the discussion of neuroendocrine changes taking place during the ovarian aging process that may impact reproductive function.
28946019	Dynamic range in BOLD modulation: lifespan aging trajectories and association with performance.	lifespan, aging	2017-??-??	Alteration of dynamic range of modulation to cognitive difficulty has been proposed as a salient predictor of cognitive aging. Here, we examine in 171 adults (aged 20-94 years) the effects of age on dynamic modulation of blood oxygenation-level dependent activation to difficulty in parametrically increasing working memory (WM) load (0-, 2-, 3-, and 4-back conditions). First, we examined parametric increases and decreases in activation to increasing WM load (positive modulation effect and negative modulation effect). Second, we examined the effect of age on modulation to difficulty (WM load) to identify regions that differed with age as difficulty increased (age-related positive and negative modulation effects). Weakened modulation to difficulty with age was found in both the positive modulation (middle frontal, superior/inferior parietal) and negative modulation effect (deactivated) regions (insula, cingulate, medial superior frontal, fusiform, and parahippocampal gyri, hippocampus, an…
12714245	Changes in the expression of CD31 and CXCR3 in CD4+ naïve T cells in elderly persons.	aging	2003-04-??	So far, very few studies exist on the naïve T cell population of elderly persons. Only recently an increase in the percentage of long lived CD4(+)CD31(-) naïve T cells has been claimed to occur with aging. We, therefore, characterised CD31(+) and CD31(-) CD45RA(+) CD4(+) T cells in young and healthy elderly persons. The production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma by the different subpopulations was studied following stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin. The expression of CD28, CD11a, CD62L, CXCR3 and CCR7 was also analysed. The results of this study demonstrate a pronounced increase in the percentage of CD31(-) CD45RA(+) T cells within the CD4 subpopulation of elderly persons. Both, CD31(-) and CD31(+) CD45RA(+) cells expressed CD28, CD62L, were CD11a (dim) and produced IL-2 but no IFN-gamma. This phenotype confirms that they were naïve T cells. IL-2 production by naïve T cells was not impaired in elderly persons. Interestingly, CD31(+) as well as CD31(-) naïve T cells contained a subpopulation of …
7097040	Effect of chronologic aging and ultraviolet irradiation on Langerhans cells in human epidermis.	aging	1982-08-??	The effect of aging on epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) and on their response to a single ultraviolet (UV) exposure was studied in skin biopsy specimens of healthy adults, 4 aged 22-26 yr and 7 aged 62-86 yr. In unirradiated skin, old adults had fewer LC than young adults, 5.8 +/- 1.1 versus 10.0 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SEM) per 3 mm wide cross-section (p = .015). Following irradiation with 3 times the minimal erythema dose, recognizable LC were absent in all but 2 subjects within 24 hr. However, LC number fell less rapidly in old adults and was almost unchanged at 4 hours (5.8 +/- 1.1 versus 5.0 +/- 1.2), while in young adults LC number decreased from 10.0 +/- 0.8 to 3.3 +/- 1.3 during the same period (p less than .05). Other changes noted in both young and old subjects following irradiation included cytoplasmic vacuolization, frequent apposition of LC to severely damaged keratinocytes, and the finding of LC in the basal layer of the epidermis rather than exclusively suprabasilarly as in con…
22505642	Cyclooxygenase inhibition augments central blood pressure and aortic wave reflection in aging humans.	aging	2012-06-15	The augmentation index and central blood pressure increase with normal aging. Recently, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, commonly used for the treatment of pain, have been associated with transient increases in the risk of cardiovascular events. We examined the effects of the COX inhibitor indomethacin (Indo) on central arterial hemodynamics and wave reflection characteristics in young and old healthy adults. High-fidelity radial arterial pressure waveforms were measured noninvasively by applanation tonometry before (control) and after Indo treatment in young (25 ± 5 yr, 7 men and 6 women) and old (64 ± 6 yr, 5 men and 6 women) subjects. Aortic systolic (control: 115 ± 3 mmHg vs. Indo: 125 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.05) and diastolic (control: 74 ± 2 mmHg vs. Indo: 79 ± 3 mmHg, P < 0.05) pressures were elevated after Indo treatment in older subjects, whereas only diastolic pressure was elevated in young subjects (control: 71 ± 2 mmHg vs. Indo: 76 ± 1 mmHg, P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure increa…
21107246	Age-related variations of human tear meniscus and diagnosis of dry eye with Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography.	aging	2011-05-??	PURPOSE: To determine the age-related variations in the human tear meniscus using Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (FD-ASOCT) and evaluate its application in dry eye screening and diagnosis.    METHODS: One hundred forty-six patients with dry eye and 160 healthy controls were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, case-control study and grouped according to age: group A (0-19 years), group B (20-39 years), group C (40-59 years), and group D (>60 years). Tear meniscus height, tear meniscus depth, and tear meniscus cross-sectional area (TMA) were measured using FD-ASOCT (RTVue-100); corneal fluorescein staining, tear film breakup time, Schirmer I test, and a dry eye questionnaire were also estimated.    RESULTS: Tear meniscus values were significantly correlated with clinical examination results and dry eye syndrome. Mean tear meniscus height, tear meniscus depth, and TMA values of patients with dry eye were significantly lower than those of the controls (P…
25353992	Long-term mild-intensity exercise regimen preserves prefrontal cortical volume against aging.	aging	2015-07-??	OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that exercise improves cognitive function and increases cerebral volume even in older people. However, the relation between cognitive function and brain volume is unclear. We evaluated the longitudinal change of cognitive function and gray matter volume due to mild-intensity exercise over 2 years, and the residual effects 6 months post-exercise.    METHODS: Subjects were 110 healthy older individuals over 65 years old in Tone town, Ibaraki prefecture. Seventy-five participants were voluntarily enrolled in the exercise group. A mild-intensity calisthenics regimen, which consisted of home-based and club-based programs for as long as 2 years, was employed as the intervention for the exercise group.    RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvement in attentional shift over the course of the observation period including a 6-month follow-up. Neuroimaging analysis revealed the significant preservation of bilateral prefrontal volume in the exercis…
23842102	Normative values and predictors of retinal oxygen saturation.	aging	2014-02-??	PURPOSE: To determine normal retinal oxygen saturation (SO2) values measured with retinal oximetry in a multiethnic group of healthy subjects and to evaluate the association of retinal SO2 with demographic and clinical parameters.    METHODS: Retinal oximetry was performed in both eyes of 61 normal healthy subjects. Global and quadrant venous (SvO2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), arteriovenous difference in SO2, and venular and arteriolar width were measured. The association of SO2 parameters with age, gender, ethnicity, refraction, iris color, history of controlled systemic hypertension, and smoking was analyzed.    RESULTS: Average SvO2 and SaO2 were 55.3 ± 7.1% and 90.4 ± 4.3%, respectively. All average measurements were comparable in both eyes, both genders, and among ethnic groups. Inferonasal quadrant SaO2 was higher in Asians. Age was associated with decreased SvO2 (β = -0.19; P = 0.001) and SaO2 (β = -0.11; P = 0.003). History of controlled systemic hypertension was ass…
11721145	Comparison of four bioelectrical impedance analysis formulas in healthy elderly subjects.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Changes of body composition occur with aging and influence health status. Thus accurate methods for measuring fat-free mass (FFM) in the elderly are essential.    OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare FFM obtained by three bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) published formulas specific for the elderly and one equation intended for all age groups, with FFM derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (FFM(DXA)), in healthy elderly subjects.    METHODS: Healthy Caucasian subjects over 65 years (106 women, age 75 +/- 6.2, body mass index 25.2 +/- 4.1 and 100 men, age 74.6 +/- 6.6, body mass index 25.8 +/- 3.0) were measured by DXA (Hologic QDR-4500) and BIA (Xitron, 50 kHz). FFM(BIA) was calculated by the published formulas of Deurenberg, Baumgartner, Roubenoff and Kyle and compared to FFM(DXA) by a Bland-Altman analysis.    RESULTS: The Deurenberg and Roubenoff BIA formulas underestimated FFM compared to DXA by -7.1 and -2.9 kg in women and -6.7 and -2.3 kg …
4008419	A hemodynamic comparison of young and older endurance athletes during exercise.	aging	1985-06-??	This study assessed the hemodynamic responses to exercise of master athletes (56 +/- 5 yr of age) who placed in the top 10% of their age groups in local 10-km competitive events, competitive young runners (26 +/- 3 yr), young runners matched in training and performance to the master athletes (25 +/- 3 yr), and healthy older sedentary subjects (58 +/- 5 yr). The maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) of the master athletes was 9 and 19% lower than that of the matched young and competitive young runners, respectively. When compared at the same relative submaximal work rates, these three groups had similar stroke volumes and arteriovenous O2 (aVO2) differences, though the master athletes had lower VO2, cardiac output, and heart rate, and higher vascular resistance. The older sedentary group had a lower stroke volume, aVO2 difference, and higher vascular resistance than the master athletes. Maximal stroke volume and estimated aVO2 difference were the same in the three groups of athletes; the lowe…
22377734	Erythrocyte sialic acid content during aging in humans: correlation with markers of oxidative stress.	aging	2012-??-??	Sialic acids are substituted neuraminic acid derivatives which are typically found at the outermost end of glycan chains on the membrane in all cell types. The role of erythrocyte membrane sialic acids during aging has been established however the relationship between sialic acid and oxidative stress is not fully understood. The present work was undertaken to analyze the relationship between erythrocyte membrane sialic acid with its plasma level, membrane and plasma lipid hydroperoxide levels and plasma total antioxidant capacity. Results show that sialic acid content decreases significantly (P< 0.001) in RBC membrane (r= -0.901) and increases in plasma (r=0.860) as a function of age in humans. Lipid peroxidation measured in the form of hydroperoxides increases significantly (P<0.001) in plasma (r=0.830) and RBC membranes (r=0.875) with age in humans. The Trolox Equivalent Total Antioxidant Capacity (TETAC) of plasma was found to be significantly decreased (P< 0.001, r=-0.844). We obse…
8556692	Effects of age on nutrient requirements.	aging	1995-11-??	The effects of age on nutrient requirements are difficult to quantify for older adults because there is great variability in aging. There are trends in changes that have been identified through longitudinal studies that indicate that, although there is a decrease in energy requirement with advancing age, there is not a parallel decrease in the need for most other nutrients. In fact, protein requirements per kilogram of body weight may increase; increases for certain vitamins may be due to their unique absorptive and metabolic processes that may be affected by chronic conditions. There is little evidence to support changes in mineral needs unless there is an association with the management of a chronic condition. Fluid requirements to prevent dehydration must be addressed in elderly people.
17174342	Development and sexual dimorphism of the pituitary gland.	aging	2007-02-13	The pituitary gland plays a central role in sexual development and brain function. Therefore, we examined the effect of age and gender on pituitary volume in a large sample of healthy children and adults. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted in one hundred and fifty four (77 males and 77 females) healthy participants. Males were between the ages of 7 to 35 years (16.91+/-5.89 years) and females were 7 to 35 years of age (16.75+/-5.75 years). Subjects were divided into subgroups of age (7 to 9, 10 to 13, 14 to 17, 18 to 21, 22 and older) and sex (male/female). Pituitary gland volume differed between sexes when comparing the age groups (F=3.55, df=2, 143, p=0.03). Females demonstrated larger pituitary glands than males in the age 14 to 17 year old groups (p=0.04). Young (19 years and under) and old (20 years and older) females demonstrated a correlation between pituitary volume and age. Males did not show this relationship. These findings provide additional evidence …
15647756	Role of NF-kappaB signaling pathway in increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes in aged humans.	aging	2005-02-??	In human aging, lymphocytes display increased sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced apoptosis. TNF-alpha induces both survival and apoptotic signals. The survival signal is mediated by the activation of NF-kappaB. Although a role of certain proapoptotic molecules in aging has been reported, a role of altered NF-kappaB signaling pathway has not been explored in detail. In this study, we have compared TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB, phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, and the expression of IKKbeta between lymphocytes from young and aged humans. Furthermore, we have explored a role of IKKbeta in increased susceptibility of lymphocytes from aged humans to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Lymphocytes from aged humans displayed decreased activation of NF-kappaB, reduced phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, and decreased expression of IKKbeta. In addition, overexpression of IKKbeta in lymphocytes from aged humans normalized TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis to the level of …
7381926	The effect of aging on complement activity (CH50) and complement protein levels.	aging	1980-01-??	Total complement activity (CH50), and the protein levels of C1q, C4, C3, C5, C9, factor B and C1 inactivator were measured in the 1,130 sera obtained from healthy subjects aged between 20 and 79 years old. Increase in the levels of CH50, C1q, C4, C3, C5 and C9 and decrease of factor B were found in the older age group. The level of C1 inactivator showed little variation with aging.
6862012	Changes in lipid phase behaviour in human myelin during maturation and aging. Involvement of lipid peroxidation.	aging	1983-06-27	The biophysical properties of human myelin isolated from white matter of patients aged two months to 74 years were investigated using wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The myelin transition temperature increased from 13 degrees C to 65 degrees C as age increased from two months to 17 years, demonstrating an increase in the myelin lipid stability. Following this maturation period, the myelin transition temperature remained constant at 65 degrees C until age 50. Beyond age 50, the transition temperature of myelin decreased by 13 degrees C indicating that myelin stability decreased with aging. During this aging period, the levels of malondialdehyde and conjugated diene increased, indicating an increasing amount of lipid peroxidation. Although evidence is indirect, the results of this investigation strongly suggest that free radicals could be a primary factor in the acceleration of the aging processes in the human brain.
23271708	Aging bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells have altered membrane glycerophospholipid composition and functionality.	aging	2013-03-??	Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSC) are increasingly used in advanced cellular therapies. The clinical use of hMSCs demands sequential cell expansions. As it is well established that membrane glycerophospholipids (GPL) provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, we studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the GPL profile of human bone marrow MSC (hBMSC). The hBMSCs, which were harvested from five young and five old adults, showed clear compositional changes during expansion seen at the level of lipid classes, lipid species, and acyl chains. The ratio of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylserine increased toward the late-passage samples. Furthermore, 20:4n-6-containing species of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine accumulated while the species containing monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) decreased during passaging. Additionally, in the total FA pool of the cells, 20:4n-6 increased, which happened at the expense of n-…
29856966	Interactive structural analysis of βTrCP1 and PER2 phosphoswitch binding through dynamics simulation assay.	aging	2018-??-01	Circadian rhythm is rhythmic gene expression that is involved in various processes of life over a day and night cycle. The rhythmic sleep disorders arise due to misalignment of sleep-wake cycle influenced by phosphorylation of PERIOD2 (PER2) phosphodegron (SSGYGS), the conserved interaction site of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP1). Here, we employed in silico approach to study the interaction pattern of βTrCP1 with PER2, PER2 and PER2 phosphodegron peptides. Substitution of phosphorylatable SER480 or SER484 into ALA resulted in the shifting of PER2 phosphodegron binding at the lower face of β-propeller, by involvement of both SER residues. PER2 binding at the shallow cavity of βTrCP1 induced conformational readjustment in ARG524 residue that connected the upper hemisphere base (10.5 Å) with the roof of lower hemisphere (6.6 Å) to create a uniform tunnel-like structure. In the absence of phosphorylation, PER2 and βTrCP1 binding stability may be compromised resulting in th…
15247037	Secretion of melatonin in healthy elderly subjects: a longitudinal study.	aging	2004-06-??	UNLABELLED: We report on a 10-year longitudinal study on 24-h serum melatonin secretion (AUC) in healthy human subjects. Fifty women and 53 men (aged 42-83 yr) participated in the study initially. Of these, 18 women and 15 men were followed for 6 consecutive years.    RESULTS: (a) Cross-sectional analysis (n = 103): A significant (R = -.49, P =.0001) decline in AUC melatonin with age was found in women, but not in men. (b) Longitudinal analysis (n = 33): Repeated-measure ANOVAs for women (n = 18): Time: linear F(1,17) = 5.14, P =.037. The AUC increased by about 40% over the six-year period. In men, there were no significant changes.    CONCLUSION: In agreement with most cross-sectional studies, an inverse relationship was found between melatonin secretion and age. However, the longitudinal study showed an increase in melatonin secretion, indicating the presence of putative compensatory mechanisms during healthy aging. Changes in melatonin secretion were gender specific, occurring in wo…
10565775	Effects of age on dopamine transporters in healthy humans.	aging	1999-11-??	UNLABELLED: 99mTc-TRODAT-1 is a new radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds the dopamine transporters. This study characterized the effects of aging on its regional cerebral distribution in healthy human volunteers.    METHODS: The sample consisted of 27 men and 28 women with a mean age of 41.1 +/- 17.1 y (age range 18.7-73.8 y). Dynamic SPECT scans of the brain were obtained with a standardized acquisition and processing protocol on a triple-head camera. Mean counts per pixel were measured in multiple regions of interest within each basal ganglia. Regression analyses were used to relate the specific uptake values at 3-4 h after administration to age. Both linear and nonlinear models of aging were tested.    RESULTS: The relative concentration of radioactivity in most subregions of the basal ganglia decreased significantly with age (all P values < 0.0001). Nonlinear models of aging fit the data significantly better than a straight line. The rate of decline was significantly faster i…
12690263	Type and timing of protein feeding to optimize anabolism.	aging	2003-05-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The delivery rate of amino acids to an organism significantly affects protein anabolism. The rate can be controlled by the type and the timing of feeding. Our aim was to bring new insights to the way they may act.    RECENT FINDINGS: During young and adult ages, when food supply is liberal, subjects can adapt to various modes of protein feeding. However, during food restriction, protein anabolism is favored when the delivery of amino acids is evenly distributed over the day, either with frequent meals, or through the use of slowly absorbed proteins like casein. In contrast, during aging, quickly absorbed protein sources become more efficient. During recovery after exercise, the timing of protein feeding after the end of exercise may or may not influence its anabolic effect, depending on the subject's age and the type of exercise.    SUMMARY: The synchronization of variations in anabolic capability with amino acid supply partly explains the effects of the type and tim…
21287403	The effects of male aging on semen quality, sperm DNA fragmentation and chromosomal abnormalities in an infertile population.	aging	2011-05-??	PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of male aging on semen quality, DNA fragmentation and chromosomal abnormalities in the spermatozoa of infertile patients and fertile men.    METHODS: Semen samples of 140 infertile patients (24-76 years) and 50 men with proven fertility (25-65 years) were analyzed according to WHO guidelines. DNA fragmentation was detected by TUNEL assay, while aneuploidy was assessed by FISH.    RESULTS: In the patient group, semen volume and vitality of spermatozoa decreased significantly with age, while sperm concentration showed a statistically significant increase with age. DNA fragmentation as well as disomy of sex chromosomes and disomy 8 did not show a statistically significant change with age. However, the diploidy rate was significantly increased with patient's age. In the control group, conventional semen parameters as well as DNA fragmentation and chromosomal abnormalities did not show a statistically significant with age.    CONCLUSION: Increased age in …
30570017	Quantitative sensory testing in elderly: longitudinal study.	aging	2018-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate elderly patients in a geriatric service, along with their sensory characteristics and their association with clinical aspects.    METHODS: This was a descriptive longitudinal study. We enrolled 36 healthy participants of both sexes in this study. The following instruments were used and evaluations performed: clinical evaluation, Mini-Mental State Exam, and quantitative sensory testing.    RESULTS: During the follow-up, there was reduction of mean corpuscular volume at each evaluation (p < 0.001) and significant increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.001). There was an increase of the olfactory (p < 0.001), salty (p = 0.024), sour (p = 0.020), bitter (p = 0.001), facial cold (p = 0.019), hand cold (p = 0.004), facial tactile (p < 0.001), hand tactile (p = 0.012) and facial vibration (p = 0.018) thresholds. Previous existing morbidities were associated with sensitivity changes in the individuals in this sample.    CONCLUSION: This longitudinal…
3653290	Covalent changes at the N- and C-terminal regions of gamma crystallin during aging of the normal human lens.	aging	1987-08-??	Polyclonal antisera have been made to synthetic peptides corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions of the putative gamma 1-2 gene from human lens. These antisera are specific for gamma crystallin, showing no cross-reactivity with any polypeptides of the alpha- and beta-crystallin fractions. Western blot analysis demonstrates a dramatic decrease in the binding of these antisera to gamma crystallin during aging of the normal human lens, while identical analysis with polyclonal antisera to the major cyanogen bromide fragment (19,000 MW) of human gamma crystallin shows little, if any, change during aging. Together, these demonstrate that antisera to synthetic peptides of the N- and C-terminal regions of the gamma 1-2 gene are very specific probes that can demonstrate extensive covalent modification from both ends of the gamma crystallin molecule during aging of the normal human lens.
17250718	Effects of physiological aging and cerebrovascular risk factors on the hemodynamic response to brain activation: a functional transcranial Doppler study.	aging	2007-02-??	The influence of the vascular system on the coupling of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to focal brain activation during aging is incompletely understood. Using functional transcranial Doppler sonography and a hypercapnic challenge as a marker of intact cerebral vasoreactivity, we determined CBF velocity (CBFV) changes in response to a language and arithmetic task in a group of 43 healthy young subjects (mean age 32 +/- 8.6 years), 18 healthy old subjects (mean age 64 +/- 9.8 years) and 29 old subjects with risk factors for an atherosclerosis (mean age 69 +/- 8.4 years). Despite a similar performance during the cognitive tasks the CBFV changes were significantly lower in the group of old subjects with vascular risk factors compared with the healthy young and old subjects. Similarly, the CBFV changes during hypercapnia were significantly lower in the group of old subjects with vascular risk factors compared with the healthy young and old subjects. In contrast, both cognitive tasks and hyperca…
19568604	Influence of gender on serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I and its binding protein-3 during aging.	aging	2009-06-30	PURPOSE: The serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factors-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and growth hormone (GH) are related to body composition, function and metabolism, and are influenced by the aging process. This study was to investigate the influence of gender on serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and GH in middle and old age subjects.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty healthy volunteers (male 35, female 25, 36-70 years) were divided into < or = 50 and > 50 years groups, based on gender. Women > 50 years were post-menopause. IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and GH were determined by immunoradiometric assay.    RESULTS: IGF-I was shown to be negatively correlated with age (women r = -0.62, p < 0.001; men r = -0.38, p < 0.05), whereas there was no correlation between IGF-I and GH values. Women > 50 years showed a significant reduction in IGF-I values than women < or = 50 years (p < 0.01). Women > 50 years showed smaller IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratios (0.177998…
3624412	Age differences in the plasma clearance mechanisms for epinephrine and norepinephrine in humans.	aging	1987-09-??	There is an age-related increase in plasma norepinephrine (NE) in humans that is due to both an increase in NE appearance into plasma and a decrease in plasma NE clearance. However, previous studies demonstrated no difference in plasma epinephrine (EPI) in young and old subjects, and the effect of aging on plasma EPI appearance and clearance is unclear. To study age differences in basal NE and EPI metabolism we infused eight young (aged 19-26 yr) and eight old (aged 64-74 yr) normal subjects with [3H]NE or [3H]EPI (15 microCi/m2 bolus dose plus 0.35 microCi/m2/min for 50 min) to achieve steady state conditions on separate days. The old subjects had higher arterialized plasma NE levels [mean, 217 +/- 13 (+/- SE) vs. 149 +/- 12 pg/mL; P less than 0.005] and plasma NE appearance. In contrast, neither plasma EPI levels (98 +/- 8 vs. 104 +/- 10 pg/mL; P = NS) nor EPI appearance rates were different in the old and young subjects. The plasma clearance rates of EPI and NE were nearly identical…
8752074	Long-term persisting cognitive sequelae of traumatic brain injury and the effect of age.	aging	1996-08-??	This study examined the notion that mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have persistent effects that become evident upon neurocognitive testing in a phase in which the effects of physiological aging become manifest. Neurocognitive performance was tested in 25 middle-aged and 20 old subjects who had sustained mild to moderate TBI, on average, several decades earlier. The TBI subjects regarded themselves as normal and healthy. The performance of the TBI subjects was inferior to that of matched healthy controls on all aspects of primary and secondary memory and on the majority of tests used to measure speed of performance. There was no interaction between the effects of TBI and those of age, and the performance of middle-aged TBI subjects was similar to that of old controls. The results are taken to indicate that TBI sustained earlier in life may cause permanent sequelae in specific domains of cognitive functioning and that it might attenuate the age-related decline in cogni…
23856043	Aberrant cortico-subcortical functional connectivity among women with poor motor control: toward uncovering the substrate of hyperkinetic perseveration.	aging	2013-09-??	OBJECTIVE: Hyperkinetic perseveration (HKP) refers to perseverative repetition of rudimentary motor output. Although HKP is known to be associated with brain injuries and certain neurodegenerative disorders (primarily those involving the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia), an increased tendency to exhibit HKP is also commonly associated with apparently normal aging (i.e., in the absence of known neuropathology). The purpose of the present study was to examine anomalies in brain functioning associated with HKP tendencies in a non-injured brain.    METHOD: The present study examined functional MRI connectivity patterns associated with HKP in a sample of 24 "young" (ages 25-35 years) and 20 "old" (ages 65-75 years) healthy community dwelling women. Participants performed a motor learning task (the Push-Turn-Taptap task: PTT) known to elicit HKP. On a separate day, participants were scanned on a Siemens 3T Trio MR scanner with a 12-channel head coil, while performing a block-design motor…
11343525	Age-related changes in frontal and temporal lobe volumes in men: a magnetic resonance imaging study.	aging	2001-05-??	BACKGROUND: Imaging and postmortem studies provide converging evidence that, beginning in adolescence, gray matter volume declines linearly until old age, while cerebrospinal fluid volumes are stable in adulthood (age 20-50 years). Given the fixed volume of the cranium in adulthood, it is surprising that most studies observe no white matter volume expansion after approximately age 20 years. We examined the effects of the aging process on the frontal and temporal lobes.    METHODS: Seventy healthy adult men aged 19 to 76 years underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Coronal images focused on the frontal and temporal lobes were acquired using pulse sequences that maximized gray vs white matter contrast. The volumes of total frontal and temporal lobes as well as the gray and white matter subcomponents were evaluated.    RESULTS: Age-related linear loss in gray matter volume in both frontal (r = -0.62, P<.001) and temporal (r = -0.48, P<.001) lobes was confirmed. However, the quadratic funct…
9743613	Relationship between plasma IGF-I levels, in vitro correlates of immunity, and human senescence.	aging	1998-09-??	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a polypeptide mitogen which is regulated by growth hormone (GH). IGF-I mediates many of the biological functions of GH, including the maintenance of lymphoid mass and functions. Since GH secretion declines with age, we asked whether changes in the availability of IGF-I might contribute to age-associated alterations in immune functions. As a first step, we examined relationships between plasma levels of IGF-I and in vitro correlates of immunity in young and elderly subjects. Heparinized plasma and lymphocytes were collected from the peripheral blood of 34 healthy young (aged 27 +/- 0.9 years, mean +/- SEM) and 41 elderly (79 +/- 1.3 years) volunteers (31 males and 44 females in total). Plasma levels of IGF-I, measured by radioimmunoassay after the removal of IGF-I-binding proteins, were reduced among elders compared to young controls (138 +/- 8.7 ng/mL vs 80.2 +/- 4.7 ng/mL, P < 0.001). The number of circulating lymphocytes did not change with age…
15244071	Baroreflex control of the heart rate during central hypovolemic stress in young and elderly men.	aging	2004-06-01	To test the hypothesis that tolerance to central hypovolemic stress is diminished with a reduced sensitivity of cardiac baroreflex in young and old men, twenty-four healthy elderly male subjects (67.5+/-0.9 yrs) and 24 young male subjects (22.4+/-0.4 yrs) underwent a 21 min bout of ramped lower body negative pressure (LBNP) (0 to -60 mmHg, 10 mmHg each for 3 min). Heart rate(HR), blood pressure, thoracic impedance (Z0) and calf circumference were measured throughout the experimental period. The sensitivity (BRS) of arterial baroreflex control of the cardiac interval was calculated from spontaneous changes in beat-to-beat arterial pressure and the RR interval during the LBNP test. The occurrence of presyncope episodes during LBNP was 16.7% in elderly subjects and 37.5% in young subjects. The changes of HR, blood pressure, Z0 and calf circumference in the young (Young fainter group) and the elderly (Elderly fainter group) subjects who showed presyncope during LBNP did not differ from tho…
23786617	Quantification and visualization of cellular NAD(P)H in young and aged female facial skin with in vivo two-photon tomography.	aging	2013-07-??	BACKGROUND: In vivo two-photon tomography is a novel noninvasive three-dimensional optical skin imaging technology with subcellular resolution which enables the sensitive detection of endogenous fluorophores. One of these fluorophores, NAD(P)H (a coenzyme which plays an important role in the release of free energy during glycolysis, and influences filaggrin and lipid synthesis), can be selectively detected in keratinocytes (granular cells) with two-photon tomography.    OBJECTIVES: To quantify NAD(P)H levels in subsurface human facial skin in vivo as a measure to determine if there are changes with age.    METHODS: A total of 80 healthy Asian females were enrolled in this study, aged 21-68 years. Measurements were performed on facial skin using in vivo two-photon tomography (DermaInspect/MPTflex™, JenLab GmbH, Jena, Germany). The laser beam scans a skin field of interest in pulses, focused at a depth to reach the granular layer. The near-infrared laser pulses excite the endogenous fluo…
18166287	TH1 and TH2 cell polarization increases with aging and is modulated by zinc supplementation.	aging	2008-05-??	Elderly subjects suffer from increased levels of activated T cells and a TH1/TH2 imbalance. Zinc deficiency of the aged is correlated with decreased cell-mediated immune responses. The association of age and zinc adjustment with the amounts of TH1 (CCR5+) and TH2 (CCR4+) cell populations in healthy aged old donors enrolled in the European ZINCAGE project was examined. Old and nonagenarian individuals revealed increased TH1, TH2 cell numbers and a decreased TH2/TH1 ratio in comparison to young individuals. The differences between TH2/TH1 ratios of young and old/nonagenarians arose from young females. Adjusted zinc status led to enhanced TH2 and TH1 amounts in fresh whole blood and thawed cells of aged donors whereas increased HLA-DR+ expression and a generally lower CCR5 expression was observed on thawed PBMC. In conclusion, aging is associated with an increase in T helper cell polarization, and changes in TH2/TH1 subsets are more obvious in women than in men. Advanced healthy aging is …
2301759	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atracurium in the elderly.	aging	1990-02-??	To evaluate the effect of aging on the distribution, clearance, and neuromuscular junction sensitivity to atracurium, the authors determined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atracurium in five healthy elderly subjects (74-76 yr) during halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia and compared these values to those obtained previously in five healthy young adults (22-44 yr). A brief (6.0-13.0 min) infusion of atracurium was administered until twitch tension was suppressed by approximately 70%, and atracurium plasma concentration and twitch tension data were used to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for each patient. Total clearance (Cltotal) was similar in elderly and young adults. However, clearance via the liver and/or kidney (Clorgan) was lower in elderly patients, whereas clearance due to Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis (Clnonorgan) was higher. Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was larger in elderly patients. The increase in Vss without a…
10490283	Age-dependent changes of antioxidant activities and markers of free radical damage in human skeletal muscle.	aging	1999-09-??	This study was conducted in order to provide evidence for the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human skeletal muscle aging. We used human muscle samples obtained from hospitalized patients in an open study with matched pairs of individuals of different ages. The subjects, ranging in age from 17 to 91 years, were grouped as follows: 17-25-, 26-35-, 36-45-, 46-55-, 56-65-, 66-75-, 76-85-, and 86-91-year-old groups. To investigate the relationship between muscle aging and oxidative damage we measured total and Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (total SOD, MnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and catalase (CAT) activities; total reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSHtot, GSH, and GSSG) levels; lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein carbonyl content (PrC). Total SOD activity decreases significantly with age in the 66-75-year-old group, although MnSOD activity increases significantly in the 76-85-year-old group. The activity of the two H2O2 detoxifying enzymes (GSHPx and CAT) did no…
25257972	Age-related changes in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the human ventral vs. dorsal striatum from childhood to middle age.	aging	2015-02-??	The striatum codes motivated behavior. Delineating age-related differences within striatal circuitry can provide insights into neural mechanisms underlying ontogenic behavioral changes and vulnerabilities to mental disorders. To this end, a dual ventral/dorsal model of striatal function was examined using resting state intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) imaging in 106 healthy individuals, ages 9-44. Broadly, the dorsal striatum (DS) is connected to prefrontal and parietal cortices and contributes to cognitive processes; the ventral striatum (VS) is connected to medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and contributes to affective valuation and motivation. Findings revealed patterns of age-related changes that differed between VS and DS iFCs. We found an age-related increase in DS iFC with posterior cingulate cortex (pCC) that stabilized after the mid-twenties, but a decrease in VS iFC with anterior insula (aIns) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that persist…
21949421	Testosterone in newly diagnosed, antipsychotic-naive men with nonaffective psychosis: a test of the accelerated aging hypothesis.	aging	2011-10-??	OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia has been associated with age-related abnormalities, including abnormal glucose tolerance, increased pulse pressure, increased inflammation, abnormal stem cell signaling, and shorter telomere length. These metabolic abnormalities and other findings suggest that schizophrenia and related disorders might be associated with accelerated aging. Testosterone activity has a progressive decline with increasing age.    METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that circulating biologically active testosterone is lower in newly diagnosed, antipsychotic-naive male patients with nonaffective psychosis than in matched control subjects.    RESULTS: Patients (n = 33) were matched to control subjects (n = 33) for age, sex, body mass index, socioeconomic status of the family of origin, and smoking. The free androgen index, a measure of biologically active testosterone, was significantly lower in the psychosis group (mean [standard deviation] = 57.7% [26.1]) than in control subjects (71.…
1917747	Sweating and skin blood flow during exercise: effects of age and maximal oxygen uptake.	aging	1991-07-??	Individuals greater than or equal to 60 yr of age are more susceptible to hyperthermia than younger people. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. To gain further insight, we examined the heat loss responses of 7 young (24-30 yr) and 13 older (58-74 yr) men during 20 min of cycle exercise [67.5% maximal O2 uptake (VO2max)] in a warm environment (30 degrees C, 55% relative humidity). Forearm blood flow (FBF) and chest sweat rate (SR) were plotted as a function of the weighted average of mean skin and esophageal temperatures [Tes(w)] during exercise. The sensitivity and threshold for each response were defined as the slope and Tes(w) at the onset of the response, respectively. When the young sedentary men were compared with a subgroup (n = 7) of the older physically active men with similar VO2max, the SR and FBF responses of the two groups did not differ significantly. However, when the young men were compared with a subgroup of older sedentary men with a similar maximal O2 pul…
3152256	Effects of aging on cardiac blood flow velocities.	aging	????-??-??	The effects of aging on cardiac blood flow velocities are important as a description of the natural history of the aging process and as a reference for evaluation of the aging cardiovascular system. We therefore studied these effects in 215 healthy volunteers, 120 males and 95 females, between 1 and 65 years old. Pulsed Doppler signals were recorded proximal and distal to the mitral (M) and tricuspid (T) valves, in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), in the ascending aorta (AAO), in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), and in the pulmonary artery (PA). Systolic (S) flow velocity patterns consist mainly of one peak. Diastolic blood flow velocity is characterized by two peaks: one due to early filling (E) of the ventricle and a second as a result of atrial contraction (A). All peaks are characterized by the maximum of the median velocity curve (Vmax). With age increasing from 1 to 65 years, VmaxS decreases in the AAO (40%) and PA (10%), VmaxE decreases on both sides of the …
8026980	Immunolocalization of type X collagen before and after mineralization of human thyroid cartilage.	aging	1994-01-??	In this study the distribution of type X collagen in thyroid cartilages of various ages is described. Fetal and juvenile thyroid cartilage was negative for type X collagen, but showed a strong staining reaction for type II collagen. Type X collagen and calcium deposition were first detected in thyroid cartilage of 18-to 21-year-old adults. Type X collagen was restricted to large chondrocytes near or in mineralized cartilage, confirming the notion that type X collagen precedes mineralization. From these observations it was concluded that chondrocytes in thyroid cartilage undergo differentiation steps that are similar, but much slower, compared to cells in growth plate and sternal cartilage. Some type X collagen-positive areas also showed staining for type I collagen, suggesting that there is a further differentiation of chondrocytes to cells which are characterized by the simultaneous synthesis of type X and I collagen. However, a dedifferentiation process during aging of thyroid cartil…
8030848	Antagonic-stress. A new treatment in gerontopsychiatry and for a healthy productive life.	aging	1994-06-30	A complex antiaging formula--Antagonic-Stress--was investigated vs. placebo (PL), meclofenoxate (MF)--neurometabolic nootropic and vs. nicergoline (NE)--cerebral vasodilator by comparative multiple trials (double-blind, randomized, and parallel) in gerontopsychiatry (DSM-III-R, 1987 and ICD-10, 1992 criteria). AS vs. PL studies in organic mental disorders--amnestic, depressive, anxiety, associated with axis III physical disorders or conditions, and in multiinfarct dementia were followed by AS vs. MF or NE investigations in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type. A total of 343 old people, distributed in 4 PL groups, 1 MF group, 1 NE group, and 5 AS groups were studied. Multiple investigations, before and after three-month treatments were made: psychometric evaluation by Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric, Self-Assessment Scale-Geriatric and their 5 subscales; psychopathological rating by Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales; as well as psychometric testing by digit symbol of WAIS, Wec…
3973359	Effectiveness of attentional cueing in older and younger adults.	aging	1985-03-??	It has been proposed that aging selectively affects cognitive processes that are effortful rather than automatic and that active, memory-driven attentional selectivity is impaired in old adults. The present study evaluated attentional selectivity in two groups of healthy adults: a younger group with mean age 19.4 years and an older group with mean age 63.6 years. A visual simple reaction time task was used in which a warning cue appearing at the beginning of each trial indicated the probable location of the target signal. Response times of both groups were shortest when the stimulus appeared at the expected location and longest when it appeared at the unexpected location; responses of both groups were also faster on trials with a 3-s warning interval compared with a 2-s warning interval. These effects of spatial and temporal expectancy were as substantial in older adults as in younger adults. Reasons for the difference between these findings and earlier results are discussed.
17139191	Healthy aging is associated with unaltered production of immunoreactive growth hormone but impaired neuroimmunomodulation.	aging	2006-??-??	BACKGROUND: Both endocrine and immune systems are continuously remodeled during aging.    OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated to what extent adrenal and somatosenescence are associated reciprocal changes in the immune system during strictly healthy aging.    METHODS: Forty-six elderly subjects and 33 young adults were recruited according to the health criteria of the SENIEUR protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide or phytohemagglutinin to assess the production of immunoreactive growth hormone (GH). Peripheral sensitivity to steroids was assessed in vitro by dexamethasone-, cortisol- or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced inhibition of T-cell proliferation. DHEA and GH levels were measured by radioimmunoassays.    RESULTS: Healthy elderly had lower salivary DHEA and serum GH levels (somatosenescence). They presented reduced T-cell sensitivity to dexamethasone but similar cellular sensitivities to cortisol and DHEA. Their …
19046657	Hormonal changes and biomarkers in late reproductive age, menopausal transition and menopause.	aging	2009-02-??	This chapter describes current definitions of the climacteric, perimenopause, menopausal transition and menopause, and discusses the 2001 Stages of Reproductive Aging (STRAW) criteria in relation to more recently proposed categorization criteria for reproductive aging. Data from endocrine studies on women throughout the menopausal transition are discussed from earliest to most recent. The earlier studies focused on the changes in levels of steroid hormones and gonadotrophins, and established that follicle-stimulating hormone undergoes the first detectable change while menstrual cycles remain regular. Erratic and less predictable changes in steroid hormones follow, especially with the onset of irregular cycles. Later serum hormone studies on the inhibins and anti-Mullerian hormone established that diminishing ovarian follicle number contributes to the endocrine changes with advancing reproductive age. A classification system of cycle types incorporating all available endocrine data and …
22569063	Effects of beta-amyloid accumulation on neural function during encoding across the adult lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2012-08-01	Limited functional imaging evidence suggests that increased beta-amyloid deposition is associated with alterations in brain function, even in healthy older adults. However, the majority of these findings report on resting-state activity or functional connectivity in adults over age 60. Much less is known about the impact of beta-amyloid on neural activations during cognitive task performance, or the impact of amyloid in young and middle-aged adults. The current study measured beta-amyloid burden from PET imaging using (18)Florbetapir, in a large continuous age sample of highly-screened, healthy adults (N=137; aged 30-89 years). The same participants also underwent fMRI scanning, performing a memory encoding task. Using both beta-amyloid burden and age as continuous predictors of encoding activity, we report a dose-response relationship of beta-amyloid load to neural function, beyond the effects of age. Specifically, individuals with greater amyloid burden evidence less neural activatio…
2592721	An in vitro analogue of immune dysfunction with altered immunoglobulin production in the aged.	aging	1989-12-??	The consequences of aging of the immune system include impaired T-lymphocyte responsiveness and aberrant immunoglobulin production. Although T cells from elderly individuals have a well-described defect in lymphoblastic transformation in response to some polyclonal mitogens, immunoglobulin abnormalities have lacked a clear in vitro model. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 young and 13 old healthy donors were cultured with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Old-donor-cell phytohemagglutinin (PHA), but not PWM, cultures had significantly lower lymphoblastic transformation compared with young donor cultures. IgG, IgA, and IgM production tended to be lower in old- versus young-donor PWM cell cultures. By contrast, despite lower lymphoblastic transformation in old-donor PHA cell cultures, immunoglobulin production was higher for old- versus young-donor cell cultures. No significant age differences were present in initial lymphocyte counts, percent B cells, T cells …
17419681	Inflammatory markers and incident fracture risk in older men and women: the Health Aging and Body Composition Study.	aging	2007-07-??	UNLABELLED: The inflammation of aging hypothesis purports that aging is the accumulation of damage, which results, in part, from chronic activation of inflammation process. We tested this hypothesis in relationship to fractures in 2985 men and women enrolled in the Health ABC study. Results showed that subjects with the greatest number of inflammatory markers have the highest risk of fracture.    INTRODUCTION: Cytokines play major roles in regulating bone remodeling in the bone microenvironment, but their relationship to fractures is uncertain.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population includes 2985 well-functioning white and black women and men (42%, black; 51%, women) 70-79 yr of age enrolled in the Health Aging and Body Composition Study. Inflammatory markers were measured in frozen serum using standardized assays. We measured interleukin (IL-6), TNFalpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble receptors (IL-2 sR, IL-6 sR, TNF sR1and TNF sR2).Cytokine-soluble receptors were meas…
1400877	Effects of testosterone supplementation in the aging male.	aging	1992-10-??	Serum androgen levels decline with aging in normal males, such that a significant number of men over 60 yr of age will have a mean serum total testosterone (T) level near the low end of the normal adult range. It is not known whether lower T levels in older men have an effect on androgen-responsive organ systems, such as muscle, bone, bone marrow, and prostate, nor are there data to evaluate the relative benefits and risks of T supplementation in older men. We assessed the physiological and biochemical effects of T therapy in 13 healthy men, 57-76 yr old, who had low or borderline low serum T levels (< or = 13.9 nmol/L). Intramuscular testosterone enanthate (TE; 100 mg weekly) and placebo injections were given for 3 months each. Before treatment and at the end of both 3-month treatment regimens, lean body mass, body fat, biochemical parameters of bone turnover, hematological parameters, lipoprotein profiles, and prostate parameters [such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA)] were evaluat…
9485371	Selective deamidation of recombinant human stem cell factor during in vitro aging: isolation and characterization of the aspartyl and isoaspartyl homodimers and heterodimers.	aging	1998-02-24	During in vitro aging, deamidation of recombinant human stem cell factor produced in Escherichia. coli was detected by HPLC analysis and by the release of soluble ammonia. The deamidation rate is very slow in buffers at low pH or at low temperatures; however, the rate is significantly accelerated in alkaline buffers such as sodium bicarbonate in combination with elevated temperatures. HPLC isolation of various deamidated forms followed by peptide mapping and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the deamidation involves Asn10 in the sequence -T9NNV- near the N-terminus of the protein. Following peptide mapping analysis, significant amounts of aspartyl and isoaspartyl peptides were identified, indicating the conversion of asparagine into both aspartate and isoaspartate residues. As a result of spontaneous association-dissociation of stem cell factor dimer, a total of five deamidated forms, including two homodimers and three heterodimers, were detected and isolated. Cell proliferatio…
11976216	Frequent intracellular clonal expansions of somatic mtDNA mutations: significance and mechanisms.	aging	2002-04-??	It has been proposed that age-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA is responsible for some aspects of the aging process. However, most cells contain hundreds to thousands of mtDNA molecules. Any nascent somatic mutant therefore appears as a single copy among a majority of wild-type species. A single mutant molecule is unlikely to influence the physiology of the cell and thus cannot play a role in the aging process. To affect cellular physiology, the nascent somatic mutants must somehow accumulate clonally in the cell to significant levels. The evidence supporting the view that, indeed, clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations is a widespread process in various human tissues, and the mechanisms by which clonal expansions may affect the aging process, are reviewed. Originally, clonal expansion was demonstrated for mtDNA with large deletions in muscle. Cell-by-cell analysis of human cardiomyocytes and buccal epithelial cells revealed that clonal expansion affects point mtDNA mu…
29769054	Factors associated with social participation amongst elders in rural Sri Lanka: a cross-sectional mixed methods analysis.	aging	2018-??-16	BACKGROUND: Populations of low and middle-income countries are ageing rapidly; there is a need for policies that support an increase in the duration of old age lived in good health. There is growing evidence that social participation protects against morbidity and mortality, but few studies explore patterns of social participation. Analysis of baseline quantitative and qualitative data from a trial of the impact of Elders' Clubs on health and well-being in the hill country of Sri Lanka provided an opportunity to better understand the extent of, and influences on, social participation among elders.    METHODS: We analysed data from 1028 baseline survey respondents and from 12 focus group discussions. Participants were consenting elders, aged over 60 years, living in Tamil tea plantation communities or Sinhala villages in 40 randomly selected local government divisions. We assessed participation in organised social activities using self-reported attendance during the previous year. Multi…
7922560	Alterations in circadian rhythmicity of the vasopressin-producing neurons of the human suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with aging.	aging	1994-07-18	The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus is implicated in the temporal organization of circadian rhythms in a variety of physiological, endocrine and behavioral processes. There is a great deal of evidence indicating that aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration of circadian timekeeping. The present study was aimed at investigating whether there are age-related changes in circadian rhythmicity of the vasopressin (VP)-producing neurons in the human SCN. To that end brains obtained at autopsy of 39 subjects, ranging in age from 6 to 91 years, were studied. Subjects were divided into two age groups, viz. 'young subjects' (up to 50 years) and 'elderly subjects' (over 50 years). It is shown that the number of VP-immunoreactive neurons in the human SCN exhibits a marked diurnal oscillation in young, but not in elderly, people. Whereas in young subjects low VP-immunoreactive neuron numbers were found during the night period (22:00-06:00 h) and peak values du…
25353611	Resting steroid hormone concentrations in lifetime exercisers and lifetime sedentary males.	aging	2015-03-??	INTRODUCTION: Advancing age in men is associated with a progressive decline in serum testosterone (T) and interactions between exercise, aging and androgen status are poorly understood. The primary aim of this study was to establish the influence of lifelong training history on serum T, cortisol (C) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in aging men. A secondary aim was to determine the agreement between serum and salivary measurement of steroid hormones in ageing men.    METHODS: Serum and salivary steroid hormones (serum C, T and SHBG, and salivary measures of C and T) were determined and compared between two distinct groups; lifelong exercising males (LE [n = 20], 60.4 ± 4.7 year) and age matched lifelong sedentary individuals (SED [n = 28], 62.5 ± 5.3 years).    RESULTS: T-test revealed a lack of significant differences for serum C or SHBG between LE and SED, while Mann-Whitney U revealed a lack of differences in total T (TT), bioavailable T (bio-T) or free testosterone (free-T).…
29717801	Prevalence of and factors associated with successful aging in Brazilian older adults: Frailty in Brazilian older people Study (FIBRA RJ).	aging	2018-08-??	AIM: We aimed to estimate the factors associated with the biomedical dimension of successful aging (SA) and its prevalence in older Brazilian individuals. The conceptual framework for this approach relies on the considerable variation in the biophysiological effects of aging and the need to understand the factors that influence this process.    METHODS: Data from a total of 845 older adults were analyzed. SA operationalization included the following criteria: good physical and cognitive performance, absence of disabilities, and good health conditions. Descriptive analyses were used to estimate the prevalence of SA, and the factors associated with SA were assessed using multivariate logistic regressions.    RESULTS: The overall prevalence of SA was 25%, and the associated factors were the absence of (OR 10.5, 95% CI 5.2-21.1) or fewer than two physical morbidities (OR,3.5, 95% CI 2.1-5.9), body mass index in the overweight range (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.02-3.3), absence of depression (OR ,2.1,…
18782346	Aging is associated with greater nuclear NF kappa B, reduced I kappa B alpha, and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in vascular endothelial cells of healthy humans.	aging	2008-12-??	The vascular endothelium may develop a proinflammatory profile with aging, but evidence is limited in humans. Expression of inflammatory proteins was determined in vascular endothelial cells (EC) obtained from peripheral veins of 24 young (23 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SE) and 36 older (63 +/- 1) healthy men and women using quantitative immunofluorescence. The older subjects had lower vascular endothelium-dependent dilation (forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine, p < 0.05), and higher plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (all p < 0.05), but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Total (O: 0.52 +/- 0.04 vs. Y: 0.33 +/- 0.05 NFkappaB/HUVEC intensity, p < 0.05) and nuclear (O: 0.59 +/- 0.04 vs. Y: 0.41 +/- 0.04) expression of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NFkappaB), a proinflammatory gene transcription factor, was greater in EC from the older subjects (p < 0.05). EC expression of the inhibitor (of nuclear translocat…
24443350	Age and sex differences in muscle sympathetic nerve activity in relation to haemodynamics, blood volume and left ventricular size.	aging	2014-06-??	We compared the effect of age- and sex-related differences in haemodynamics, blood volume (BV) and left ventricular (LV) size and mass on resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in healthy, normotensive adults. Twenty young men (19-47 years old) and 20 young women (21-46 years old) as well as 15 older men (62-80 years old) and 15 older women (60-82 years old) were studied. Cardiac output (acetylene rebreathing), total peripheral resistance, forearm vascular resistance (FVR; venous occlusion plethysmography) and MSNA were measured during supine rest. Blood volume was calculated (CO rebreathing), and LV mass, end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV) were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac index (P < 0.001 and P = 0.016), BV (both P < 0.001), LV mass (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002), LVEDV (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002) and LVESV (both P < 0.001) were lower in the older and female groups, respectively. Total peripheral resistance was significantly higher in the …
26163682	Association of regional muscle strength with mortality and hospitalisation in older people.	aging	2015-09-??	BACKGROUND: the association between muscular strength, mortality and hospitalisation with ageing can change depending on sex and the body region analysed (e.g. upper and lower limb muscles).    OBJECTIVE: to determine the effect of measuring lower and upper extremities muscular strength on the relationship between strength, mortality and hospitalisation risk in elder men and women.    DESIGN: a population-based cohort study using data from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA).    METHODS: a Spanish population sample of 1,755 elders aged ≥65 years participated in this study. Upper (handgrip and shoulder) and lower limbs (knee and hip) maximal voluntary isometric strength was obtained using standardised techniques and equipment. Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine mortality and hospitalisation over 5.5 and 3 years of follow-up, respectively.    RESULTS: after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including co-morbidities and BMI, hazard ratio of death and hosp…
9883902	Aging- and smoking-associated alteration in the relative content of mitochondrial DNA in human lung.	aging	1998-12-18	mtDNA mutations and oxidative DNA damage has been observed to accumulate in the lung and other tissues in human aging. Thus, it is of interest to know whether the content of mtDNA is changed in aging tissues of the human. Using a competitive PCR method, we determined the relative content of mtDNA in the lung tissues of 49 subjects aged 16-85 years. The results showed that the relative content of mtDNA (with respect to the beta-actin gene) in the lung tissues was significantly increased with age (P < 0.005). The average mtDNA content in the lung tissues of the subjects over 80 years of age was found to be about 2.6-fold higher than that of the subjects below age 20. However, the relative content of mtDNA was slightly increased in the lung tissues of light smokers but significantly decreased in heavy smokers. Moreover, we found a significant increase with age in the level of oxidative damage to DNA as indicated by the ratio of 8-OH-dG/dG in total DNA (P < 0.0005). These results together …
11390549	(133)Xe SPECT cerebral blood flow study in a healthy population: determination of T-scores.	aging	2001-06-??	UNLABELLED: Dementia is becoming a major health problem as the population of the Northern Hemisphere ages. Early differential diagnosis between normal cognitive decline and dementia is particularly difficult. If psychometric evaluation can contribute to the diagnosis, quantitative cerebral functional imaging would play an important role. We therefore proposed, first, to constitute a normative dataset that could later be used to identify subjects at risk for neurodegenerative processes and, second, to describe the risk of abnormal global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) by defining categories based on the standardized cutoff scores of a young, healthy population (T-score).    METHODS: Of a total of 203 healthy volunteers, 187 were included in the protocol, which included evaluation of medical history, neurologic and neuropsychologic status, and body composition; analysis of blood; and measurement of gCBF by means of (133)Xe SPECT.    RESULTS: With ANOVA analysis using age and sex as between-s…
8670752	Levels of crystallin fragments and identification of their origin in water soluble high molecular weight (HMW) proteins of human lenses.	aging	1996-05-??	PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine in the human lens water soluble-high molecular weight (WS-HMW)-proteins: (a) the levels of degraded polypeptides (crystallin fragments), and (b) the in vivo cleavage sites in the parent crystallins to produce the major fragments.    METHODS: The WS-HMW proteins (Mr > 15 x 10(6) daltons) were isolated as a void volume peak from homogenates of lenses of donors of different ages using Agarose A 15m gel-filtration chromatography. The degraded polypeptides (Mr < 18 kDa), present in the WS-HMW proteins, were separated by a preparative SDS-PAGE method and quantified as a percent of total WS-HMW proteins. In addition, the parent crystallins of the major polypeptides were identified by the Western blot method using antibodies raised either to the whole crystallin molecule or to desired regions at N- and C-terminals or middle of individual crystallins. The partial N-terminal sequences of purified individual polypeptides were determined to identit…
9442927	Enhanced expression of initiator TRNA(Met) in human gastric and colorectal carcinoma.	aging	1997-12-??	Transfer RNA isoaccepting species are differentially expressed at different times during development, differentiation, growth, aging, and carcinogenesis processes. It has been suggested that alterations in tRNA patterns might be mechanistically important in modulating gene expression during the various physiological/pathological cellular stages. As part of a study to investigate the possible mechanisms by which alterations of translational machinery can start and/or sustain carcinogenic cell proliferation, in this communication we report analysis of tRNA distribution in two gastro-intestinal human tumors. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained for cellular tRNA distribution put into evidence a shift in the tRNA population with increased level of initiator tRNA(Met) in the malignant tissues. This observation confirms previous data obtained on experimental carcinogenesis models and suggests the possibility of specific involvement of tRNA changes in protein synthesis initiation du…
29920435	Aging of human alpha rhythm.	lifespan, aging	2018-??-??	Alpha rhythm (AR) changes are the most pronounced electroencephalogram phenomenon in the aging brain. We analyzed them based on the inherent AR structure obtained by parallel factor analysis decomposition in the cortical source space. AR showed a stable multicomponent structure in 78% of sixty 20- to 81-year-old healthy adults. Typically, it consists of 2 components. The distribution of the higher frequency occipito-parietal component widens with age, with its maximum moving from BA18/19 to BA37. The low-frequency component originating from the occipito-temporal regions in young adults also moves anteriorly with age, while maintaining its maximum within BA37. Both components slow down by 1 Hz over the adult lifespan. The multicomponent AR is more common in younger subjects, whereas a single-component AR in older subjects. This uneven occurrence as well as the increasing spatial and frequency overlaps between components suggest transformation of the multicomponent AR into the single-com…
12377141	Regional frontal cortical volumes decrease differentially in aging: an MRI study to compare volumetric approaches and voxel-based morphometry.	aging	2002-10-??	Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that the frontal lobes are the part of the brain most profoundly affected by the aging process. The present study investigated whether subregions within the frontal cortex show different patterns of brain aging. Magnetic resonance images of 57 healthy participants between 21 and 81 years old were used to measure regional frontal gray matter volumes in three ways: a manual tracing method, a semiautomatic "Talairach boxes" volumetric method, and voxel-based morphometry. Seven regions within each hemisphere were manually traced: precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral frontal cortex, ventral medial region, lateral orbital region, anterior cingulate, and frontal pole. With the semiautomatic approach, four regions were measured: lateral, orbital, and medial frontal regions and frontal pole. Advancing age was strongly associated with decreases in the volume of the whole frontal cortex. Differential age effects on the volumes of frontal subre…
24535011	Impact of age and body position on the contribution of nitric oxide to femoral artery shear rate: implications for atherosclerosis.	aging	2014-05-??	Reduced shear stress and augmented oscillatory shear rate are associated with the proatherogenic phenotype observed with aging. To date, mechanisms contributing to the age-related alterations in shear rate in humans have only been examined in the conduit vessels of the arm. Therefore, this study sought to examine the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability to age-related alterations in shear rate and the impact of common body positions (supine and seated) in the atherosclerotic-prone conduit artery of the leg. Inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) was accomplished by intra-arterial infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), and common femoral artery diameter and blood velocity were measured by Doppler ultrasound in healthy young (n=8, 24±1 years) and old (n=8, 75±3 years) men. Old subjects exhibited reduced mean shear rate in the supine (18±3 s(-1)) and seated positions (17±3 s(-1)) compared with young subjects (supine: 42±6 s(-1); seated: 32±4 s(-1)). This reduced mean shear…
28587932	Preliminary evidence that age and sex affect exercise-induced hTERT expression.	aging	2017-??-01	The ability to repair cellular damage is reduced with aging, resulting in cellular senescence. Telomeres shorten as cells divide but the rate of telomere attrition is modulated by telomerase, an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the chromosome. Shelterin is a protein complex that acts as a negative regulator of telomerase. The aim of the present study was to investigate age-related differences in telomerase and shelterin responses to acute exercise. We hypothesized that acute exercise would stimulate an increased activity of telomerase (measured by telomerase reverse transcriptase, hTERT) without an increase in activity of shelterin (measured by telomeric repeat binding factor 2, TRF2) in both young and older individuals and that hTERT response would be attenuated in older individuals. Young (22±2y, n=11) and older (60±2y, n=8) men and women performed 30min of cycling. Blood was collected pre-exercise and 30, 60, and 90-min post-exercise. The trial induced a significant hTERT response in…
28285816	Survival, disabilities in activities of daily living, and physical and cognitive functioning among the oldest-old in China: a cohort study.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2017-??-22	BACKGROUND: The oldest-old (those aged ≥80 years) are the most rapidly growing age group globally, and are most in need of health care and assistance. We aimed to assess changes in mortality, disability in activities of daily living, and physical and cognitive functioning among oldest-old individuals between 1998 and 2008.    METHODS: We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study. Three pairs of cohorts aged 80-89 years, 90-99 years, and 100-105 years (in total, 19 528 oldest-old participants) were examined; the two cohorts in each pair were born 10 years apart, with the same age at the time of the assessment in the 1998 and 2008 surveys. Four health outcomes were investigated: annual death rate, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), physical performance in three tests and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used different tests and multivariate regression analyses to examine the cohort differences.    FINDINGS: Controlling for vario…
26607246	Prostaglandin E2/cyclooxygenase pathway in human skeletal muscle: influence of muscle fiber type and age.	aging	2016-03-01	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced by the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway regulates skeletal muscle protein turnover and exercise training adaptations. The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) define the PGE2/COX pathway enzymes and receptors in human skeletal muscle, with a focus on type I and II muscle fibers; and 2) examine the influence of aging on this pathway. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the soleus (primarily type I fibers) and vastus lateralis (proportionally more type II fibers than soleus) of young men and women (n = 8; 26 ± 2 yr), and from the vastus lateralis of young (n = 8; 25 ± 1 yr) and old (n = 12; 79 ± 2 yr) men and women. PGE2/COX pathway proteins [COX enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), PGE2 synthases (cPGES, mPGES-1, and mPGES-2), and PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4)] were quantified via Western blot. COX-1, cPGES, mPGES-2, and all four PGE2 receptors were detected in all skeletal muscle samples examined. COX-1 (P < 0.1) and mPGES-2 were ∼20% higher, while EP3 was …
9088906	Expression of endothelin, fibronectin, and mortalin as aging and mortality markers.	aging	????-??-??	Studies on fibronectin, endothelin-1, and mortalin from our laboratory are reviewed here. Fibronectin expression has been analyzed as upregulated during in vitro serial passaging of human fetal lung and neonatal foreskin fibroblasts as well as umbilical vein endothelial cells. In vivo aging of skin fibroblasts, as well as aortic endothelial cells, are also accompanied by upregulation of fibronectin expression. Fibronectin promoter binding proteins from young and old cell nuclear extracts were further explored by gel retardation assay. Preliminary analyses have detected age-related differential binding activities with respect to AP-1, CRES, TFIID, CTF, and AP-2 regions, whereas Sp1 binding proteins remain unaltered. Endothelin-1 expression is also seen as upregulated during in vitro and in vivo aging of endothelial cells. This can contribute to the hypertension commonly observed in elderly patients. Mortalin, a novel member of hsp 70 family of proteins, was initially identified by virtu…
17215550	Age-related differences in muscle power during single-step balance recovery.	aging	2006-08-??	The purpose of this study was to investigate age-related differences in muscle power during a surrogate task of trip recovery. Participants included 10 healthy young men (19-23 years old) and 10 healthy older men (65-83). The task involved releasing participants from a forward-leaning posture. After release, participants attempted to recover their balance using a single step of the right foot. Muscle power at the hip, knee, and ankle of the stepping limb were determined from the product of joint angular velocity and joint torque. Muscle powers during balance recovery followed a relatively consistent pattern in both young and older men, and showed effects of both lean and age. Interestingly, the effects of age did not always involve smaller peak power values in the older men as expected from the well-documented loss of muscle power with aging. Older men exhibited smaller peak muscle power at the knee and larger peak muscle power at the ankle and hip compared to young men. The increases …
27786590	Individual Leg Muscle Contributions to the Cost of Walking: Effects of Age and Walking Speed.	aging	2017-04-??	This study examined the contributions of individual muscles to changes in energetic cost of transport (COT) over seven walking speeds, and compared results between healthy young and elderly subjects. Twenty six participants (13 young aged 18-30; 13 old aged 70-80) were recruited. COT (O/kg body mass/km) was calculated by standardizing the mean oxygen consumption recorded during steady state walking. Electromyography signals from 10 leg muscles were used to calculate the cumulative activity required to traverse a unit of distance (CMAPD) for each muscle at each speed. In the old group CMAPD was correlated with COT, presented higher and more variable values, and showed greater increases around optimal speed for all studied muscles. Soleus CMAPD was independent of speed in the young group, but this was not evident with aging. Greater energy cost of walking in older individuals seems to be attributable to increased energy cost of all lower limb muscles.
8992127	Influence of the age and sex on respiratory burst of human monocytes.	aging	1996-09-18	The respiratory burst reaction has been studied in monocytes from men and women of different age. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used to stimulate NADPH oxidase. Superoxide anion production was found to be dependent on age and sex (it decreased 45% in men and 70% in women during aging).
29609594	Cluster randomized controlled trial of a multilevel physical activity intervention for older adults.	aging	2018-??-02	BACKGROUND: Older adults are the least active population group. Interventions in residential settings may support a multi-level approach to behavior change.    METHODS: In a cluster randomized control trial, 11 San Diego retirement communities were assigned to a physical activity (PA) intervention or a healthy aging attention control condition. Participants were 307 adults over 65 years old. The multilevel PA intervention was delivered with the assistance of peer leaders, who were trained older adult from the retirement communities. Intervention components included individual counseling & self-monitoring with pedometers, group education sessions, group walks, community advocacy and pedestrian community change projects. Intervention condition by time interactions were tested using generalized mixed effects regressions. The primary outcomes was accelerometer measured physical activity. Secondary outcomes were blood pressure and objectively measured physical functioning.    RESULTS: Over …
15854780	No major month to month variation in free testosterone levels in aging males. Minor impact on the biological diagnosis of 'andropause'.	aging	2005-08-??	BACKGROUND: The measurement of bioavailable testosterone (BT) or free testosterone (FT) levels is currently considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency in elderly men. While the impact of age on circulating testosterone levels (total, bioavailable and free) has been strongly documented, the existence of seasonal variations in testosterone levels remains debated.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether seasonal variations in serum calculated free testosterone (cFT) levels may translate into variations in the prevalence of low testosterone levels. Diagnosis was on the basis of biochemical determinations and was cross-checked with the prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms of 'andropause', as assessed by the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (ADAM) questionnaire.    METHODS: The study recruited 5028 men aged 50 years and over from September 2000 to January 2003. Their serum FT levels were assessed and they completed the French ADAM test. Men were considered eug…
16834928	Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 mediates up-regulation of angiotensin II-induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression in cultured human senescent fibroblasts.	aging	2006-07-05	BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II (Ang II), a principal effector of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and increased in aging tissues, can stimulate JAK/STAT pathway via the G-protein-coupled Ang II receptor type I (AT1) and induce nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). To further explore the role of Ang II in aging, we examined the effect of Ang II on human replicative senescent diploid fibroblast WI-38 cells.    METHODS: Human senescent WI-38 cells were incubated with Ang II, receptor antagonist PD123319, valsartan, STAT3 sense plasmid, and/or STAT3 antisense plasmids. Methods were applied including electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Western blot, transfection, and laser scanning confocal microscopy.    RESULTS: It was found that cultured human senescent WI-38 cells constitutively expressed tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and Ang II induced TIMP-1 protein expression in both time- and dose-dependent manners. Ang II induced …
11353681	Hypothesis testing of the aging male gonadal axis via a biomathematical construct.	aging	2001-06-??	Neuroendocrine axes are feedback- and feedforward-coupled dynamic ensembles. Disruption of selected pathways in such networklike organizations may explicate loss of orderly hormonal output as observed in aging. To test this notion more explicitly, we implemented an earlier computer-assisted biomathematical model of the interlinked male hypothalamo [gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)]-pituitary [luteinizing hormone, (LH)]-testicular [Leydig cell testosterone (Te)] axis (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab Physiol 275: E157--E176, 1988; Keenan D., W. Sun, and J. D. Veldhuis, SIAM J Appl Math 61: 934--965, 2000). Thereby, we appraise mechanistic hypotheses for more disorderly LH and Te secretion in aging men. We compare model predictions with monitored abnormalities in the older male, namely, irregular patterns of individual and synchronous LH and Te release, reduced 24-h rhythmic Te output, and variably elevated LH secretion. Among the mechanisms examined, the most parsimonious aging hypoth…
7999922	Effects of interleukin-4 on antigen-specific antibody synthesis by lymphocytes from old and young adults.	aging	1994-08-??	The current series of experiments were designed to explore the role of the B cell growth factor, interleukin-4 (IL-4), in the age-related decrease in production of antitetanus toxoid antibody in vitro. Exogenous recombinant IL-4 led to significant suppression of antitetanus toxoid antibody synthesis and numbers of antitetanus toxoid antibody-secreting B cells in cultures from healthy old subjects and healthy young subjects. These effects were most pronounced when IL-4 was present during the early phase of culture. Lymphocytes from old subjects were less sensitive to these effects and produced significantly less IL-4 than did lymphocytes from young controls. The addition of exogenous IL-4 may be inhibiting early activation signals that normally stimulate proliferation of B cells. A decreased sensitivity to the growth-promoting effects of IL-4 may be one of the mechanisms underlying defective specific antibody synthesis in aging.
7044904	Aspects of sleep, daytime vigilance, mental performance and psychotropic drug treatment in the elderly.	aging	1982-??-??	As people grow older, their subjective and objective sleep patterns change: sleep is often experienced as less deep, more broken, less refreshing - and these alterations find their objective correlate in polygraphic sleep recordings. Reductions in high amplitude slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and sleep maintenance are the best documented of these. Besides, there are changes in the EEG pattern during sleep (fewer and slower sleep spindels, fewer K-complexes and other phasic events). Daytime EEG recordings in the elderly are characterized by slowing of the dominant alpha rhythm, diffuse or localized slow waves and reduced reactivity to stimuli. Only few studies, however, have addressed the question of how daytime EEG alterations are related to changes of the sleep polygram, and how these electrophysiological parameters relate to measures of mental performance which also undergo changes with aging. A review of published results and data from our own studies suggest that, …
12392789	The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in restoring the aging neuronal membrane.	aging	????-??-??	In addition to a gradual loss of neurons in various brain regions, major biochemical changes in the brain affect the neuronal membrane that is the "site of action" for many essential functions including long-term potentiation (LTP), learning and memory, sleep, pain threshold, and thermoregulation. Normal physiological functioning includes the transmission of axonal information, regulation of membrane-bound enzymes, control of ionic channels and various receptors. All are highly dependent on membrane fluidity, where rigidity is increased during aging. The significantly higher level of cholesterol in aging neuronal membrane, the slow rate of cholesterol turnover, and the decreased level of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may result from poor passage rate via the blood-brain barrier, or from a decreased rate of incorporation into the membrane, or a decrease in the activities of delta-6 and delta-9 desaturase enzymes. The added oxidative stress, which leads to an increase of free …
29720677	Circulating microRNAs disclose biology of normal cognitive function in healthy elderly people - a discovery twin study.	aging	2018-??-??	Neurobiology is regulated by miRNA. Here circulating plasma miRNAs were assayed on a 754 miRNA OpenArray platform using 90 monozygotic elderly twins (73-95 year of age) and associated with mini mental state examination (MMSE) and a five-component cognitive score (CCS) in an explorative study. Both ordinary individual and twin-pair analyses were performed with level of cognitive scores. Candidate miRNAs were further associated with cognitive decline over 10 years using up to six repeated assessments. A total of 278 miRNAs were expressed in plasma from at least ten participants and 23 miRNAs were nominally associated (i.e., at an uncorrected p < 0.05) with CCS or MMSE in the paired analyses. Generally, elderly individuals with poor cognitive function had increase miRNA expression compared with equivalent individuals who performed better on the cognitive scale. Three miRNAs, miR-151a-3p, miR-212-3p and miR-1274b were associated with CCS both in the paired and the individual analysis. Four…
29394898	Methylation of the genes ROD1, NLRC5, and HKR1 is associated with aging in Hainan centenarians.	aging	2018-??-02	BACKGROUND: Human aging is a hot topic in biology, and it has been associated with DNA methylation changes at specific genomic sites. We aimed to study the changes of DNA methylation at a single-CpG-site resolution using peripheral blood samples from centenarians.    METHODS: Using Illumina 450 K Methylation BeadChip microarray assays, we carried out a pool-based, epigenome-wide investigation of DNA methylation of blood samples from 12 centenarians and 12 healthy controls. Differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) sites were selected for further pyrosequencing analysis of blood samples from 30 centenarians and 30 healthy controls.    RESULT: We identified a total of 31 high-confidence CpG sites with differential methylation profiles between the groups: 9 (29%) were hypermethylated and 22 (71%) were hypomethylated in centenarians. It was also found that hypermethylation of HKR1 and hypomethylation of ROD1 and NLRC5 genes strongly correlated with age in centenarians.  …
1984902	Exercise training improves left ventricular systolic function in older men.	aging	1991-01-??	To determine whether endurance exercise training can improve left ventricular systolic function in older men, 10 healthy sedentary men (64 +/- 3 years old; mean +/- SD) were studied. Training consisted of endurance exercise 4 +/- 0.3 days per week for 11.8 +/- 2.5 months at a progressively increasing intensity of 60-80% of maximal O2 uptake (Vo2max) with additional brief bouts of exercise equal to 93 +/- 13% of Vo2max. Vo2max increased from 29.6 +/- 4.1 to 37.2 +/- 5.7 ml/kg/min (p less than 0.001). Percent body fat was decreased (17.8 +/- 3.6% versus 15.6 +/- 3.6%; p less than 0.001). Before training, left ventricular ejection fraction, determined by electrocardiographic-gated equilibrium blood pool imaging, increased only modestly during exercise (from 66.3 +/- 6.7% at rest to 70.6 +/- 6.9% at peak exercise). After training, the increase in ejection fraction during exercise was significantly greater (from 67 +/- 4.8% at rest to 77.6 +/- 7.5% at peak exercise) than that observed befor…
8370415	Increased cytokine production in mononuclear cells of healthy elderly people.	aging	1993-09-??	The production of cytokines during aging, except interleukin (IL)-2, has been neglected in humans. We measured the in vitro production of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-1 beta by peripheral mononuclear cells from selected healthy young (mean age 26.8 years) and aged (mean age 80.2 years) subjects. Significant increases of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were found in mitogen-stimulated cultures from aged donors, occurring at 24 to 72 h after stimulation. No significant differences were observed for IFN-gamma production. Proliferative capability of cells stimulated with PHA was not impaired in aged subjects. Since the amounts of all cytokines studied were similar in unstimulated cultures from young and aged subjects, and also serum levels of TNF-alpha did not differ, these data indicate that the cellular machinery for the production of these cytokines is well preserved in aging, and also that cells from old people are able to up-regulate thei…
16390744	Experiences with the French Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale.	aging	????-??-??	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this paper is to report on experiences gained from the application of the French version of the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, to show correlations with other relevant scales and to provide population reference values for France.    METHODS: A representative survey based on an existing, representative population panel was performed in France (963 males, aged 15 + years). Other AMS data from Europe were then used for comparison. Mean scores of the French AMS scale do not systematically differ from the data of other European studies. The population reference values obtained for France strongly suggest that the scale measures can appreciate the level of well-being whatever the patients' age; however, some variables, such as age and family income, can influence the total AMS scores. Comparisons with the generic quality-of-life scale, SF-12, and a depression scale, HAD, have shown good correlations, as have comparisons with the ADAM questionnaire.    CONCLUSION:…
26146886	Responses to patronizing communication and factors that attenuate those responses.	aging	2015-09-??	The purpose of this study was to investigate younger (n = 52, ages 18-24) and older (n = 69, ages 61-98) adults' responses to patronizing communication in terms of (a) performance on a cognitive task (Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-III block design) and (b) physiological responses (i.e., change in cortisol levels), as well as factors that may attenuate those responses. Participants were randomly assigned to receive instructions for the task using either a patronizing or nonpatronizing speech style. Participants also completed a measure of attitudes about aging and the quantity/quality of their intergenerational interaction. Older adults (relative to younger adults) were found to be more reactive to the patronizing speech style in terms of their performance on the task as well as the change in their cortisol levels. Older adults who had more positive attitudes about aging as well as more positive intergenerational interactions were protected from the performance deficits as a result …
21743053	Linking biological and cognitive aging: toward improving characterizations of developmental time.	aging	2011-07-??	OBJECTIVES: Chronological age is the most frequently employed predictor in life-span developmental research, despite repeated assertions that it is best conceived as a proxy for true mechanistic changes that influence cognition across time. The present investigation explores the potential that selected functional biomarkers may contribute to the more effective conceptual and operational definitions of developmental time.    METHODS: We used data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study to explore both static and dynamic biological or physiological markers that arguably influence process-specific mechanisms underlying cognitive changes in late life. Multilevel models were fit to test the dynamic coupling between change in theoretically relevant biomarkers (e.g., grip strength, pulmonary function) and change in select cognitive measures (e.g., executive function, episodic and semantic memory).    RESULTS: Results showed that, independent of the passage of developmental time (indexed as years…
12787919	Advanced glycation endproducts as UVA photosensitizers of tryptophan and ascorbic acid: consequences for the lens.	aging	2003-06-11	Upon aging, the lens accumulates brown fluorophores, mainly derived from the Maillard reaction between vitamin C oxidation products and crystallins lysine residues. At the same time, the concentration of UVA filters decreases, allowing some radiation to be absorbed by lenticular advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). This paper quantifies the photosensitizing activity of AGEs at various oxygen pressures, and compares it to that of lenticular riboflavin (RF). Solutions containing the sensitizer and the substrates tryptophan (Trp) and ascorbate (AH(-)) were irradiated at 365 nm. We show that the AGEs-photosensitized Trp oxidation rate increases with AGEs concentration and is optimal at 5% oxygen, the pressure in the lens. By contrast, for AH(-), the photooxidation rate increases with oxygen concentration. Despite the higher quantum yield of RF-depending reactions, its low concentration as compared to that of AGEs in aging lenses induces significantly higher Trp and AH(-) photodegradation…
24270215	Elder abuse: research, practice, and health policy. The 2012 GSA Maxwell Pollack award lecture.	aging	2014-04-??	Elder abuse, also called elder mistreatment or elder maltreatment, includes psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, neglect (caregiver neglect and self-neglect), and financial exploitation. Evidence suggests that 1 out of 10 older adults experiences some form of elder abuse, and only a fraction of cases are actually reported to social services agencies. At the same time, elder abuse is independently associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Despite these findings, there is a great paucity in research, practice, and policy dealing with this pervasive issue. In this paper, I review the epidemiology of elder abuse as well as key practical issues in dealing with the cases of elder abuse. Through my experiences as a Congressional Policy Fellow/National Health and Aging Policy Fellow, I highlight key previsions on 2 major federal legislations dealing with the issues of elder abuse: Older Americans Act (OAA) and Elder Justice Act (EJA). Lastly, I highlight major resear…
15037568	Age-related changes in the photoreactivity of retinal lipofuscin granules: role of chloroform-insoluble components.	aging	2004-04-??	PURPOSE: Lipofuscin accumulates in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells with age and may be the main factor responsible for the increasing susceptibility of RPE to photo-oxidation with age. As the composition, absorption, and fluorescence of lipofuscin undergo age-related changes, the purpose of this study was to determine whether photoreactivity of lipofuscin granules also changes with the donor age.    METHODS: To determine whether the photoreactivity of lipofuscin itself is age related, lipofuscin granules were isolated from human RPE and pooled into age groups. Photoreactivity was assessed by measuring action spectra of photo-induced oxygen uptake and photogeneration of reactive oxygen species. Separation of chloroform-soluble (ChS) and -insoluble (ChNS) components by Folch's extraction was used to determine the factors responsible for the age-related increase in lipofuscin photoreactivity.    RESULTS: The observed rates of photo-induced oxygen uptake and photo-induced accu…
16899935	Partially opposite hemorheological effects of aging and training at middle age.	aging	2006-??-??	Aging impairs blood rheology while various training protocols improve it. The purpose of this study was to delineate the respective role of aging and endurance training on blood rheology. Thirty-two subjects [16 middle-aged men: 8 cyclists (MAcy) and 8 sedentary men (MAsed) and 16 young men: 8 cyclists (Ycy) and 8 sedentary men (Ysed)] were compared in this study. Results showed higher red blood cell (RBC) rigidity and aggregability (AFFIBIO), lower RBC disaggregability (AFFIBIO) at middle age than at 25 yr, regardless of training status. However there was no age-related difference in whole blood viscosity at either native or corrected hematocrit, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, and Myrenne aggregation indexes M and M1. Training was associated with a reduced hematocrit in middle age subjects but not in 25 yr old ones. We evidenced no effect of training on red cell rigidity (Dintenfass's Tk index), in whole blood viscosity at either native or corrected hematocrit, and plasma viscosity. Th…
19882408	Subjective forgetfulness is associated with lower quality of life in middle-aged and young-old individuals: a 9-year follow-up in older participants from the Maastricht Aging Study.	aging	2009-09-??	OBJECTIVES: Many people regard themselves as being forgetful. They may be hindered by or worried about this subjective forgetfulness in daily life. The first aim of the present study was to determine whether perceived forgetfulness in healthy older adults is related to a lower quality of life. The second objective was to assess whether the association between perceived forgetfulness and quality of life changes over a 9-year follow-up period.    METHOD: A group of 412 participants in the longitudinal Maastricht Aging Study, aged 54 years or older, were interviewed and tested at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 years. Four proxy measures of quality of life were studied; satisfaction with life, mental well-being, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.    RESULTS: Results showed that subjective forgetfulness was associated with a lower quality of life. In addition, in individuals considering themselves forgetful, a significant increase was found in symptoms of anxiety, compared to those who had no p…
26738118	Effect of data length and bin numbers on distribution entropy (DistEn) measurement in analyzing healthy aging.	aging	2015-??-??	Complexity analysis of a given time series is executed using various measures of irregularity, the most commonly used being Approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy (SampEn) and Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn). However, the dependence of these measures on the critical parameter of tolerance `r' leads to precarious results, owing to random selections of r. Attempts to eliminate the use of r in entropy calculations introduced a new measure of entropy namely distribution entropy (DistEn) based on the empirical probability distribution function (ePDF). DistEn completely avoids the use of a variance dependent parameter like r and replaces it by a parameter M, which corresponds to the number of bins used in the histogram to calculate it. When tested for synthetic data, M has been observed to produce a minimal effect on DistEn as compared to the effect of r on other entropy measures. Also, DistEn is said to be relatively stable with data length (N) variations, as far as synthetic data is concerned.…
15031811	2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and alternative radiotracers for positron emission tomography imaging using the human brain as a model.	aging	2004-04-??	2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) is now routinely available in many hospitals and other institutions either via on-site production or from one of the dozens of regional radiopharmacies worldwide. Its reliable production has opened the possibility for use in both basic and clinical investigations and also in pairing it with other more biologically specific positron emission tomography tracers to provide an important functional perspective to the measurement. In this article, we highlight examples in which 18FDG is paired with another carbon-11- or fluorine-18-labeled radiotracer in the same subject to correlate neurotransmitter-specific effects with regional metabolic effects using the human brain as a model. We describe studies that fall into three major areas: normal aging, neuropsychiatric disorders, and drug action.
24055232	The matricellular protein periostin contributes to proper collagen function and is downregulated during skin aging.	aging	2014-01-??	BACKGROUND: Periostin is a secreted 90kDa matricellular protein, which is predominantly expressed in collagen-rich tissues. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and has great tensile strength. Recent investigations have shown that periostin influences collagen fibrillogenesis and biomechanical properties of murine connective tissues.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated the function of periostin concerning collagen homeostasis during intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging. For this purpose, human skin samples of young and old donors as well as samples of photoaged and sun-protected skin areas were analyzed for periostin expression. Using in vitro models, we determined the cell types responsible for periostin expression and performed functional analyses with periostin knockdown cells.    METHODS: TaqMan Real-Time PCR, UV irradiation, knockdown experiments, immunostaining, electron microscopy, collagen degradation assay, collagen crosslink analysis.    RESULTS: Periostin expression is h…
25423123	Laser speckle contrast imaging: age-related changes in microvascular blood flow and correlation with pulse-wave velocity in healthy subjects.	aging	2015-05-??	In the cardiovascular system, the macrocirculation and microcirculation—two subsystems—can be affected by aging. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an emerging noninvasive optical technique that allows the monitoring of microvascular function and can help, using specific data processing, to understand the relationship between the subsystems. Using LSCI, the goals of this study are: (i) to assess the aging effect over microvascular parameters (perfusion and moving blood cells velocity, MBCV) and macrocirculation parameters (pulse-wave velocity, PWV) and (ii) to study the relationship between these parameters. In 16 healthy subjects (20 to 62 years old), perfusion and MBCV computed from LSCI are studied in three physiological states: rest, vascular occlusion, and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH). MBCV is computed from a model of velocity distribution. During PORH, the experimental results show a relationship between perfusion and age (R(2) = 0.67) and between MBCV and age …
2439851	Cellular senescence revisited: a review.	aging	1987-03-??	The field of cellular senescence (cytogerontology) is reviewed. The historical precedence for investigation in this field is summarized, and placed in the context of more recent studies of the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The now-classical embryonic lung fibroblast model is compared to models utilizing other cell types as well as cells from donors of different ages and phenotypes. Modulation of cellular senescence by growth factors, hormones, and genetic manipulation is contrasted, but newer studies in oncogene involvement are omitted. A current consensus would include the view that the life span of normal diploid cells in culture is limited, is under genetic control, and is capable of being modified. Finally, embryonic cells aging in vitro share certain characteristics with early passage cells derived from donors of increasing age.
27265392	Risk Taking for Potential Reward Decreases across the Lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2016-??-20	The extent to which aging affects decision-making is controversial. Given the critical financial decisions that older adults face (e.g., managing retirement funds), changes in risk preferences are of particular importance [1]. Although some studies have found that older individuals are more risk averse than younger ones [2-4], there are also conflicting results, and a recent meta-analysis found no evidence for a consistent change in risk taking across the lifespan [5]. There has as yet been little examination of one potential substrate for age-related changes in decision-making, namely age-related decline in dopamine, a neuromodulator associated with risk-taking behavior. Here, we characterized choice preferences in a smartphone-based experiment (n = 25,189) in which participants chose between safe and risky options. The number of risky options chosen in trials with potential gains but not potential losses decreased gradually over the lifespan, a finding with potentially important econ…
7912275	Density of alpha-2A adrenoceptors and Gi proteins in the human brain: ratio of high-affinity agonist sites to antagonist sites and effect of age.	aging	1994-06-??	In the postmortem human brain, the specific binding of the agonists [3H]clonidine and [3H]bromoxidine ([3H]UK14034) and of the antagonist [3H]2-methoxyidazoxan (RX821002) and inhibition by l-epinephrine of [3H]RX821002 binding were determined in parallel to quantify the fractions of high (RH)- and low-affinity (RL) agonist sites of alpha-2A adrenoceptors and to investigate the association of these inhibitory receptors with various regulatory Gi proteins and the effect of aging. In the frontal cortex, the density of RH with [3H]clonidine was not different from that with [3H]UK14304 and the ratio of Bmax values in the same subjects was 0.88 +/- 0.05 (n = 39). The inhibition of [3H] RX821002 binding by l-epinephrine allowed the resolution and quantitation of the RH and RL with similar values to those obtained in saturation experiments. The simultaneous analysis and computer modeling of competition and saturation experiments performed in the same subjects indicated that a high proportion o…
18573012	Learning to avoid in older age.	aging	2008-06-??	The dopamine hypothesis of aging suggests that a monotonic dopaminergic decline accounts for many of the changes found in cognitive aging. The authors tested 44 older adults with a probabilistic selection task sensitive to dopaminergic function and designed to assess relative biases to learn more from positive or negative feedback. Previous studies demonstrated that low levels of dopamine lead to avoidance of those choices that lead to negative outcomes, whereas high levels of dopamine result in an increased sensitivity to positive outcomes. In the current study, age had a significant effect on the bias to avoid negative outcomes: Older seniors showed an enhanced tendency to learn from negative compared with positive consequences of their decisions. Younger seniors failed to show this negative learning bias. Moreover, the enhanced probabilistic integration of negative outcomes in older seniors was accompanied by a reduction in trial-to-trial learning from positive outcomes, thought to …
17472230	Integrating "brain" and "body" measures: correlations between EEG and metabolic changes over the human lifespan.	lifespan	2007-03-??	AIMS: This study investigated the relationship between electroencephalograph (EEG) power and basal metabolic rate (BMR) over the human lifespan, to better understand the mechanisms involved in the decline of neural activity with age.    METHODS: Eyes-open EEG power was calculated in standard frequency bands and averaged across recording sites in 1831 healthy subjects aged 6 to 86 years, from the Brain Resource International Database. In a subset of 175 subjects, structural MRI scans were also undertaken to determine the role of grey matter. Cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) was estimated using two models of EEG power, based on: (1) normalization of BMR by total body mass, and (2) scaling by cortical grey matter.    RESULTS: Regression analysis revealed a linear relationship between the CMR estimates and EEG power under both models. In the full sample, CMR explained 65% of the variance in delta power, and 53% of the variance in theta power over the age span.    DISCUSSION: The results demon…
17984623	Aging-related oxidative stress in healthy humans.	aging	2007-11-??	Oxidative stress has been reported to increase with aging; however, the scientific evidence is controversial. We therefore aimed to analyze the relationship between aging and some markers of oxidative stress. A cross-sectional and comparative study was carried out in a sample of 249 healthy subjects: (i) 25-29 years (n = 22); (ii) 30-39 years (24); (iii) 40-49 years (30); (iv) 50-59 years (48); (v) 60-69 years (60), and (vi) >or= 70 years (65). We measured lipoperoxides and total antioxidant status in plasma and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in erythrocytes. There was an age-related increase in lipoperoxides, which was evident in the comparison of the group of 25-29 years (0.22 0.11 micromol/l) with the group of 60-69 years (0.38 +/- 0.18 micromol/l, p < 0.01) and >or= 70 years (0.42 +/- 0.19, p < 0.001). Conversely, the total antioxidant status showed an age-related decrease (25-29 years, 1.4 +/- 0.31 mmol/l vs 60-69 years, 1.1 +/- 0.21 and >or= 70 years, …
18029095	Increased amygdala activation is related to heart rate during emotion processing in adolescent subjects.	aging	2007-11-27	Emotions have been conceptualized as representations of bodily responses to a stimulus that critically involves the autonomic nervous system (ANS). An association between amygdala activation and ANS activity has been shown in adults. However, to date, no studies have demonstrated this association in adolescents. Examining the interaction between the ANS and amygdala in healthy adolescents may provide information about age-related changes in the association between amygdala activation and ANS measures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and heart rate in normal adolescents. Eighteen 12- to 17-year old adolescents participated. Heart rate data was collected during functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a facial expression matching task that reliably activates the amygdala. Adolescents showed significant amygdala activation for all facial expressions relative to the shape-matching, control task. Moreover, th…
30791386	Understanding the Wellbeing of the Oldest-Old in China: A Study of Socio-Economic and Geographical Variations Based on CLHLS Data.	longevity	2019-??-19	Empirical studies of the socio-economic determinants of the wellbeing of the oldest-old in China including the role of geography and spatial factors are rare. This paper applies binary logistic regression analysis to data on the oldest-old aged 80 years old and higher from the 2011 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). Socioeconomic determinants of the self-reported quality of life (QoL) and self-reported health (SRH) of the oldest-old population are explored, with special attention paid to the role of residence and region. The results indicate that, after controlling for individual demographic and health behavior variables, both economic status and social welfare have a significant effect on self-reported QoL and SRH. There are also significant differences in self-reported QoL among cities, towns and rural areas, with the oldest-old respondents living in Central rural, Western town and Western rural areas being significantly less likely to report good QoL, compared to …
7836641	Changes in small-intestine permeability with aging.	aging	1995-02-??	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate small-intestine mucosal integrity and permeability with advancing age as measured by the lactulose/mannitol absorption test in healthy subjects.    DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.    SETTING: Clinical research unit of the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging.    STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six subjects were recruited in three age groups: 20 to 39 years (n = 20), 40 to 59 years (n = 19), and > or = 60 years (n = 17). Subjects were healthy, community-dwelling volunteers.    INTERVENTION: After an 8-hour fast, all subjects ingested 10 g of lactulose and 5 g of mannitol. Urine was collected for 6 hours and analyzed for lactulose and mannitol by high performance liquid chromatography. Twenty-four-hour urinary creatinine clearances were determined.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentages of lactulose and mannitol excreted, the lactulose/mannitol ratio (x100), and the 24-hour creatinine clearance.    RESULTS: With increasing age, both the percentage of lactulose …
16948487	Serum basal hormone concentrations and muscle mass in aging women: effects of strength training and diet.	aging	2006-06-??	This study examined the effects of strength training and diet on serum basal hormone concentrations and muscle mass in aging women. Fifty-one women age 49 to 74 y were divided into two groups: strength training and nutritional counseling (n = 25), and strength training (n = 26). Both groups performed strength training twice a week for 21 wk. Nutritional counseling was given to attain sufficient energy and protein intake and recommended intake of fat and fiber. We found that the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris increased by 9.5 +/- 4.1% in the nutritional counseling group versus 6.8 +/- 3.5% in the strength training only group after training (P < 0.052). Nutritional counseling evoked dietary changes such as increases in the proportion of energy from protein and the ratio of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Strength training increased testosterone and testosterone/sex hormone-binding globulin ratio after the first half of training, but these returned to baseline v…
24285677	Age-dependent decline in acyl-ghrelin concentrations and reduced association of acyl-ghrelin and growth hormone in healthy older adults.	aging	2014-02-??	BACKGROUND: Acyl-ghrelin is thought to have both orexigenic effects and to stimulate GH release. A possible cause of the anorexia of aging is an age-dependent decrease in circulating acyl-ghrelin levels.    OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to compare acyl-ghrelin and GH concentrations between healthy old and young adults and to examine the relationship of acyl-ghrelin and GH secretion in both age groups.    METHODS: Six healthy older adults (age 62-74 y, body mass index range 20.9-29 kg/m(2)) and eight healthy young men (aged 18-28 y, body mass index range 20.6-26.2 kg/m(2)) had frequent blood samples drawn for hormone measurements every 10 minutes for 24 hours. Ghrelin was measured in an in-house, two-site sandwich ELISA specific for full-length acyl-ghrelin. GH was measured in a sensitive assay (Immulite 2000), and GH peaks were determined by deconvolution analysis. The acyl-ghrelin/GH association was estimated from correlations between amplitudes of individual GH secretory e…
11547833	Cross-sectional evaluation of bone metabolism in men.	aging	2001-09-??	There are relatively few data concerning age-related changes of bone turnover in men. The aim of the study was to evaluate age-related changes of the levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone metabolism in a large cohort of 934 men aged 19-85 years and to investigate their association with bone mineral density (BMD). Bone formation was evaluated using serum levels of osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and N-terminal extension propeptide of type I collagen (PINP). Bone resorption was evaluated by measurement of urinary excretion of beta-isomerized C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I beta-CTX) of free deoxypyridinoline (fDpyr) and total Dpyr (tDPyr) and of the serum level of beta-CTX. Levels of biochemical bone markers were very high in young men and decreased rapidly until the age of 40 years and then more slowly until 60 years of age. After the age of 60 years, markers of bone formation remained stable while resorption markers showed a moderate and v…
10622419	Age-associated changes in mitochondrial parameters on peripheral human lymphocytes.	aging	1999-11-??	Among theories of aging, mitochondria are believed to be involved in senescence. Alterations of respiratory chain function and accumulation of various mitochondrial DNA mutations have been reported in mammalian postmitotic tissues. Because mitochondria have a central role in apoptosis and in adenosine triphosphate production, alteration of mitochondria function could contribute to immune senescence. We searched for alterations of mitochondrial parameters in peripheral lymphocytes with aging. Comparisons of respiratory chain activities of complex II+III, III, and IV were carried out in two populations of healthy volunteers with average ages of 35.3 +/- 6.7 years and 80.8 +/- 8.7 years. No difference was observed in complex IV activity between each group, whereas a significant decrease of complex II+III and a nonsignificant decrease of complex III activity were observed with aging. Alterations in mitochondrial functions can result from mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the most com…
16026789	Age-related decrease in high-density lipoproteins antioxidant activity is due to an alteration in the PON1's free sulfhydryl groups.	aging	2006-03-??	The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of HDL with aging and to investigate the implication of PON1 in this process. The study involved 54 healthy subjects distributed in two age groups, young (20-25 years) and elderly (65-85 years). Lipid peroxidation was induced by *OH and O2*- oxygen free radicals produced by gamma-radiolysis of water. LDL oxidation was followed by the measurement of conjugated diene (CD), lipid peroxide (LP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. PON1 was purified separately from young (Y-PON1) and elderly subjects (E-PON1). PON1 activity and structure was followed by measurement of PON1 paraoxonase (p.ase) activity, titration of the SH groups, and electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE. Our results show a significant decrease in the HDL antioxidant activity: percentage of protection against CD formation=27.70% (p<0.01) for E-HDL versus 73.08% (p<0.001) for Y-HDL. Moreover, E-PON1 showed a lower antioxidant activity when compared to Y-PON1 47.08…
8142454	Simultaneous racemization and isomerization at specific aspartic acid residues in alpha B-crystallin from the aged human lens.	aging	1994-02-16	We provide evidence that the racemization and isomerization of aspartyl(Asp) residues occur simultaneously in the alpha B-crystallin in the lens of aged (mean age: 80 years) and young (age: 11 months) humans. We purified alpha B-crystallin and subjected it to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high-performance chromatography (RP-HPLC) and were characterized by amino-acid composition, sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. Two specific sites, Asp-36 (D/L of Asp: 0.92) and Asp-62(D/L of Asp: 0.57), among 13 Asp/asparginyl (Asn) residues in aged alpha B-crystallin, were found to be highly racemized and isomerized to form beta-Asp residues. The beta-Asp-containing peptides were clearly distinguished from normal Asp-containing (alpha-Asp) peptides by RP-HPLC. The racemization and isomerization of Asp residues in aged alpha B-crystallin may occur via a succinimide intermediate. In young alpha B-crystallin, we observed neither racemization nor isomeriz…
28161030	Brain-behavior relationships in source memory: Effects of age and memory ability.	aging	2017-??-??	There is considerable evidence for age-related decrements in source memory retrieval, but the literature on the neural correlates of these impairments is mixed. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine source memory retrieval-related brain activity, and the monotonic relationship between retrieval-related brain activity and source memory accuracy, as a function of both healthy aging (younger vs older) and memory ability within the older adult group (Hi-Old vs Lo-Old). Participants studied lists of word pairs, half visually, half aurally; these were re-presented visually in a scanned test phase and participants indicated if the pair was 'seen' or 'heard' in the study phase. The Lo-Old, but not the Hi-Old, showed source memory performance decrements compared to the Young. During retrieval of source memories, younger and older adults engaged lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial posterior parietal (and occipital) cortices. The groups differed…
10443989	Hypoperfusion of the cerebellum and aging effects on cerebral cortex blood flow in abstinent alcoholics: a SPECT study.	aging	1999-07-??	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated hypotheses concerning alcoholism, aging, and the relationship between cerebral hypoperfusion and residual deficits in the functioning of cerebellar and neocortical brain systems.    METHODS: The participants were 10 healthy abstinent alcoholics (9 men, 1 woman) and 12 nonalcoholic controls (10 men, 2 women) ranging in age from 35 to 67 years. Cerebral blood flow was observed through the use of regionally specific computer-derived quantitative analysis of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion images. Cerebellar perfusion was measured and compared with cerebral cortex perfusion in age-equivalent subgroups of alcoholics and controls (under 55 years; 55 years and over).    RESULTS: In abstinent alcoholics under age 55, cerebellar perfusion ratios were significantly reduced compared with the controls. In alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls 55 years old and older, this relationship was reversed, probably as a result of diminished corti…
8002507	Effects of strength training on total and regional body composition in older men.	aging	1994-08-??	The effects of a 16-wk strength-training program on total and regional body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and hydrodensitometry in 13 untrained healthy men [60 +/- 4 (SD) yr]. Nine additional men (62 +/- 6 yr) served as inactive controls. The strength-training program resulted in substantial increases in both upper (39 +/- 8%; P < 0.001) and lower (42 +/- 14%; P < 0.001) body strength. Total fat-free mass (FFM) increased by 2 kg (62.0 +/- 7.1 to 64.0 +/- 7.2 kg; P < 0.001), and total fat mass decreased by the same amount (23.8 +/- 6.7 to 21.8 +/- 6.0 kg; P < 0.001) when measured by DEXA. When measured by hydrodensitometry, similar increases in FFM (61.3 +/- 7.8 to 63.0 +/- 7.6 kg; P < 0.01) and decreases in fat mass (23.8 +/- 7.9 to 22.1 +/- 7.7 kg; P < 0.001) were observed. When measured by DEXA, FFM was increased in the arms (6.045 +/- 0.860 to 6.418 +/- 0.803 kg; P < 0.01), legs (19.416 +/- 2.228 to 20.131 +/-…
26277229	Low-frequency oscillations in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular hemodynamics: Their interrelationships and the effect of age.	aging	2015-11-??	The aim of this study was to investigate how the interrelationships between low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in the cerebral and systemic cardiovascular hemodynamic systems change with aging and systemic hemodynamic perturbation. Seventeen young adult (28.4±3.5years) and seventeen elderly subjects (69.4±8.7years) underwent continuous measurements of arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR), and cerebral oxygenation (oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin) using near-infrared spectroscopy. The LFOs were subdivided into three frequency intervals (FI-1: 0.01-0.02Hz, FI-2: 0.02-0.06Hz, and FI-3: 0.06-0.15Hz) via spectral analysis based on continuous wavelet transform. The amplitudes of the LFOs at these FIs were calculated to examine the effects of aging and head-up tilt (HUT) on cerebral and cardiovascular hemodynamics. Granger causality (GC) was used for analyzing the causal relationships between the LFOs observed in ABP, oxy-hemoglobin, and HR. The amplitudes of t…
3625670	Structural changes in the proteoglycans of human articular cartilage during aging.	aging	1987-05-??	The structure of the aggregating proteoglycans from human articular cartilage changes continuously from the early fetus to the mature adult, due to variation in both synthetic and degradative processes. The changes due to synthesis are most prominent prior to the end of growth, and are responsible for variations in the structure and abundance of the glycosaminoglycan chains. In contrast, the changes due to degradation occur throughout life, but predominate during aging of the adult. They result in proteolytic fragmentation of both the proteoglycan subunits and the link proteins, with those products possessing hyaluronic acid-binding capability accumulating in the tissue.
18370593	Aging does not affect brain patterns of repetition effects associated with perceptual priming of novel objects.	aging	2008-10-??	This study examined how aging affects the spatial patterns of repetition effects associated with perceptual priming of unfamiliar visual objects. Healthy young (n = 14) and elderly adults (n = 13) viewed four repetitions of structurally possible and impossible figures while being scanned with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although explicit recognition memory for the figures was reduced in the elder subjects, repetition priming did not differ across the two age groups. Using multivariate linear modeling, we found that the spatial networks of regions that demonstrated repetition-related increases and decreases in activity were identical in both age groups, although there was a trend for smaller magnitude repetition effects in these networks in the elder adults for objects that had been repeated thrice. Furthermore, repetition-related reductions in activity in the left inferior frontal cortex for possible objects correlated with repetition-relate…
10197727	Aging and red blood cell membrane: a study of centenarians.	longevity, aging	1999-01-??	Successful aging, characterized by little or no loss in physiological functions, should be the usual aging process in centenarians. It is known that well-preserved physiological functions depend on the proper functioning of cell systems. In this article we focus on cell membrane integrity and study the red blood cell membrane to evaluate the effect of physiological aging in centenarians. Fifteen healthy, self-sufficient centenarians, mean age 103 years, were examined by assessing hemocytometric values and some relevant characteristics of the erythrocyte membrane, i.e., the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio, the distribution of phospholipid classes and their fatty acid composition, the integral and skeletal protein profiles. The centenarians showed a significant decrease in the red blood cell count (p < 0.0002), hemoglobin (p < 0.0002), and hematocrit (p < 0.0005). The red blood cell membrane showed a significantly increased cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio (p < 0.01), with a con…
26212214	Effects of Kyunghee Facial Resistance Program (KFRP) on mechanical and elastic properties of skin.	aging	2016-??-??	INTRODUCTION: Facial skin aging is influenced by weakened mimetic muscles. Resistance training of facial mimetic muscles could be one of practical strategy to defend against age-related changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an exercise program (KFRP: Kyunghee Facial Resistance Program) designed for facial mimetic muscles on the mechanical properties and elasticity of facial skin.    METHODS: For this study, 16 healthy female volunteers aged 35-58 participated in KFRP for eight weeks. The mechanical and elastic properties of skin were measured using a Cutometer® on the face and neck.    RESULTS: The parameters representing skin fatigue decreased and the parameters representing skin elasticity increased significantly compared to the baseline in all measured regions. The ability of re-deformation of skin increased significantly except the zygomaticus and platysma muscle regions. All measured regions of skin became firmer and the ability to return to the initial …
20399614	Role of antioxidants in the skin: anti-aging effects.	aging	2010-05-??	Intracellular and extracellular oxidative stress initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) advance skin aging, which is characterized by wrinkles and atypical pigmentation. Because UV enhances ROS generation in cells, skin aging is usually discussed in relation to UV exposure. The use of antioxidants is an effective approach to prevent symptoms related to photo-induced aging of the skin. In this review, the mechanisms of ROS generation and ROS elimination in the body are summarized. The effects of ROS generated in the skin and the roles of ROS in altering the skin are also discussed. In addition, the effects of representative antioxidants on the skin are summarized with a focus on skin aging.
2761117	Aqueous flare intensity and age.	aging	1989-??-??	The influence of aging on the blood-aqueous barrier function was assessed by measuring aqueous flare intensity in 203 normal eyes of healthy human subjects aged 20 to 79 years, using the recently developed laser flare-cell meter. The flare intensity correlated well with age (r = 0.502, Spearman r = 0.503, P = 0.00), and the intensity values in the subjects with their ages in the 6th, 7th and 8th decade were significantly higher than the values in the subjects in their 3rd decade (P less than 0.01).
19469016	Effect of age, smoking and other lifestyle factors on urinary 7-methylguanine and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine.	aging	2009-04-??	Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and 7-methylguanine (m7Gua) were measured by a column-switching high performance liquid chromatography method as markers of oxidative and methylating DNA damage, respectively. We investigated the associations between urinary 8-OH-dG or m7Gua and various lifestyle and demographic factors, such as age and sex. The urinary 8-OH-dG excretion level was positively correlated with cigarette smoking, but inversely correlated with fruit consumption, physical activity and total energy consumed per day. A multiple regression analysis revealed that daily physical activity and healthy meal combinations decreased the urinary 8-OH-dG level, whereas alcohol consumption increased it. In terms of the urinary m7Gua measurement, cigarette smoking, age and consumption of meat, fish, egg, soybean, etc. were positively correlated with the urinary m7Gua level, whereas body weight, BMI, physical activity, and dietary index score, which indicates good nutritional balanc…
26691797	Physical performance and its association with anthropometric and body composition variables in the elderly.	aging	2015-12-??	The aging process leads to biological changes that affect the physical performance and nutritional status of older adults. The objective this study is to determine the association between physical performance and anthropometric and body composition variables in the elderly. This is a cross-sectional study. Were assessed: sex, age, handgrip strength (HGS), flexibility/mobility, balance, body mass index, waist and calf circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, arm fat area and arm muscle circumference. Multiple logistic regression was used (p<0.05). Overall, 420 elderly were evaluated. Malnourished individuals were more likely to show poor HGS. Elderly aged 70-79 years, 80 years or older and those malnourished were more likely to show poor balance. Older women were less likely to show poor flexibility/mobility. We conclude that lowercalf circumferencewas associatedwithworse performance inHGSand balance.The ageincreased the chanceof the elderlypresentinstability.The flexibility/mobilityd…
2214364	Characterization of water-insoluble proteins in normal and cataractous human lens.	aging	1990-??-??	The mechanism of lens protein aggregation with age and/or cataract formation was investigated using the peptides resolubilized from the insoluble protein fraction of normal and cataractous human lenses. The insoluble fraction was treated with reductants for cleaving disulfide bonds, or with chelating agents for removing calcium ions from the aggregates. This study demonstrates that the insoluble protein aggregates consist of an approximately 400 Kd complex, which is formed by the peptides with lower molecular weight. Protein aggregation in the cataractous lens might be caused by disulfide bonds whereas, in aging, the aggregate might be preferentially formed by calcium ion bridges rather than by disulfide bonds. It was observed that the aggregate from the cataractous lenses involved a peptide with a molecular mass lower by 1 Kd or 2 Kd than the peptides found in the normal lens. The composition of crystallins in aggregating proteins and their secondary structures were also different in …
379461	Progress in cytogerontology.	aging	1979-03-??	The finite in vitro lifetime of cultured normal cells is interpreted to be aging at the cellular level. In addition to the inverse relationship between donor age and population doubling potential (PDP), a number of biochemical and physiological increments and decrements occur prior to the cessation of cell division. The reconstruction of replicating normal human cells from the nuclei of "young" cells and the cytoplasm of "old" cells (and the reverse) suggests that the nucleus governs PDP. Several morphological changes were found to occur in late phase III cells held for up to one year in culture. Autoradiography studies show that (1) a cell population may be composed of several subpopulations, each of which is at a different stage in its life history and (2) lipid synthesis is affected much less as cells age than is DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Changes occurring in the genetic program of individual cells seem to be the most tenable hypothesis to explain fundamental causes of aging.
21487705	Effects of aging and menopause on serum interleukin-6 levels and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production in healthy nonobese women.	aging	2012-04-??	Inappropriate interleukin-6 production is thought to play a role in the development of several age-related conditions including atherosclerosis. This study aimed to determine whether aging affects circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Healthy, nonobese women (n = 208, 44.5 ± 0.70 years, 22.4 ± 0.17 kg/m(2)) were categorized into four age groups (22-31, 32-41, 42-51, and 52-63 years; cross-sectional study). Cytokine levels in serum and those produced from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were measured. The oldest group had the highest circulating levels of IL-6 and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and higher PBMC production of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1β). Additionally, significant interactions between age and menopause were found for serum IL-6 (P = 0.024), and TNF-α (P = 0.011) and IL-1β (P < 0.001) produced from PBMCs. Serum IL-6 levels positively correlated with age, waist-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure, circula…
9008514	Age-related reduction in functional MRI response to photic stimulation.	aging	1997-01-??	Many functional imaging studies have demonstrated age-related alterations in cerebral blood flow during the resting state. However, few studies have addressed possible differences in functional response to cerebral activation. We assessed the response of visual cortex to photic stimulation in 9 normal elderly subjects and 17 normal younger subjects with blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that the amplitude of response in elderly subjects was significantly decreased compared to younger subjects (2.5 +/- 1.0% versus 4.0 +/- 1.6%, p = 0.01), suggesting a reduction in functional activation or an age-related alteration in the coupling of blood oxygenation to focal activation.
18327548	Plasma antioxidants and human aging: a study on healthy elderly Tunisian population.	aging	2008-09-??	The aging has been described by several theories. It was proposed that free radicals are the major factor involved in this process. This gave birth to the free radical theory of aging. This current theory provides the most popular explanation for how aging occurs at the biochemical/molecular level. Ever since 1956, this theory has received widespread attention and a large body of evidence has been accumulated in support of its hypotheses which were subsequently refined. The free radical theory of aging postulates that age-associated reductions in physiological functions are caused by an irreversible accumulation of oxidative alterations to macromolecules. This accumulation increases with age and is associated with the life expectancy of organisms. Moreover, this theory suggests the existence of an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing pathways and (ROS)-scavenging pathways, which is responsible for the generation of oxidative stress syndrome. In this article, we eva…
22421272	Effect of age on toxicokinetics among human volunteers exposed to propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME).	aging	2012-05-20	UNLABELLED: Aging adults represent the fastest growing population segment in many countries. Physiological and metabolic changes in the aging process may alter how aging adults biologically respond to pollutants. In a controlled human toxicokinetic study (exposure chamber; 12 m³), aging volunteers (n=10; >58 years) were exposed to propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME, CAS no. 107-98-2) at 50 ppm for 6 h. The dose-dependent renal excretion of oxidative metabolites, conjugated and free PGME could potentially be altered by age.    AIMS: (1) Compare PGME toxicokinetic profiles between aging and young volunteers (20-25 years) and gender; (2) test the predictive power of a compartmental toxicokinetic (TK) model developed for aging persons against urinary PGME concentrations found in this study.    METHODS: Urine samples were collected before, during, and after the exposure. Urinary PGME was quantified by capillary GC/FID.    RESULTS: Differences in urinary PGME profiles were not noted bet…
3720346	Age-dependent changes in the heat-stable crystallin, beta Bp, of the human lens.	aging	1986-05-??	The present study examined the effects of aging and cataractogenesis on the biochemical properties of the uniquely heat-stable lens crystallin, beta basic principle polypeptide (beta Bp). Using the techniques of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western-blot immunoassay, we analyzed cortical and nuclear lens sections from normal lenses of individuals aged 0 to 91 years for beta Bp content in the soluble fraction, and retention of heat stability with aging. In addition, we compared the characteristics of beta Bp in cataractous lenses with those of normal lenses of approximately the same age. While beta Bp is synthesized in new cortical cells throughout life, the beta Bp of the nucleus, which had been laid down early in life, decreased significantly in both absolute concentration and in its proportion of the total soluble protein fraction during the normal aging process. In addition, posttranslational changes in the nuclear soluble beta Bp result in a gradual loss of …
1652310	Effect of age on second messenger generation in neutrophils.	aging	1991-09-01	Neutrophils from healthy elderly donors generate significantly less diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) than neutrophils from young donors, following stimulation by the chemotactic peptide, formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP). The defect in signal transduction occurred at a point proximal to the generation of IP3 and DAG, since the reduction in FMLP-induced superoxide generation was corrected if the intervening signal transduction steps were bypassed, either by priming with a substimulatory dose (1.62 nmol/L) of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), by ionophore elevation of cytosolic calcium, or by using a stimulatory dose of PMA (1.62 mumol/L). FMLP receptor number and affinity were unaffected by aging. On FMLP activation, neutrophils from old, as compared with young, volunteers showed significantly greater and more long-lasting decreases in the concentrations of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bi…
3034810	Divergent effects of human lymphokine derived oligopeptides on PMNLs function of young and aged healthy subjects.	aging	1987-??-??	The effects of low molecular weight lymphokine-derived oligopeptides (LK-OPs) on PMNLs effector functions and receptor mediated biochemical events were studied in the case of healthy young and aged subjects. In the case of young subjects the low mol. wt. LK-OPs stimulated the Fc gamma receptor-mediated effector functions of PMNLs, whereas an inhibition was observed in PMNLs of the elderly (extracellular cytotoxicity and intracellular killing). The underlying biochemical events, induced by low mol. wt. LK-OPs stimulation, were also investigated. In PMNLs of young subjects the oxidative metabolism was stimulated (enhanced O2 consumption, O2 and H2O2 production) by low mol. wt. LK-OPs, while in elderly subjects it was inhibited. The cyclic nucleotides regulating the Fc gamma receptor mediated effector functions and the oxygen radicals formation showed an altered dynamic response under low mol. wt. LK-OPs stimulation with aging i.e. the cGMP level could not be changed at all. Our results s…
20498223	The association of alanine transaminase with aging, frailty, and mortality.	aging	2010-07-??	The relationships between blood tests of liver function and injury (alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, and albumin) with age, frailty, and survival were investigated in 1,673 community-dwelling men aged 70 years or older. ALT was lower in older participants. Those participants with ALT below the median at baseline had reduced survival (hazard ratio 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-2.87) up to 4.9 years. Older age, frailty, low albumin, low body mass index, and alcohol abstinence also were associated with reduced survival, with age and frailty being the most powerful predictors. Low ALT was associated with frailty (odds ratio 3.54, 95% CI 2.45-5.11), and the relationship between ALT and survival disappeared once frailty and age were included in the survival analysis. Low ALT activity is a predictor of reduced survival; however, this seems to be mediated by its association with frailty and increasing age. ALT has potential value as a novel biomarker…
3516362	The aging lung.	aging	1986-05-??	Structural changes occur in the respiratory system with advancing age. Lung elasticity decreases, stiffness of the chest wall increases, and respiratory muscle strength declines. These alterations contribute to gradual, but progressive, reductions in forced vital capacity, expiratory flow rates, diffusing capacity, gas exchange, ventilatory drive, and respiratory sensation. Cigarette smoking accelerates the age-related decline in flow rates. Understanding the effects of aging on the lung is important in order to distinguish pathologic changes from changes that are part of the normal aging process.
10642082	The effect of age on protein metabolism.	aging	2000-01-??	The mechanisms of senescence remain to be fully defined. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of body protein turnover, which is essential for the remodeling of tissues and production of specific proteins in time of need. Recent advances in technology make it possible to measure the synthesis rate of muscle myosin heavy chain, mitochondrial proteins and sarcoplasmic proteins, providing insight into the mechanisms of the sarcopenia of aging. A reduced synthesis rate of myosin heavy chain and mitochondrial protein may explain muscle weakness and fatiguability that occurs with aging. Aging also seems to affect selected liver proteins such as fibrinogen. The potential roles of exercise and hormone replacement in slowing the age-related decline in protein turnover is discussed.
2358643	Is there a link between dementia and phenylketonuria?	aging	1990-05-??	This study searches for causes of dementia by posing the hypothesis that the natural decline in the metabolic functioning associated with aging may mimic the specific "error in metabolism" present in some children at birth that leads to phenylketonuria. Although the Guthrie Test is adequate for children, perhaps a quantitative test is needed for the elderly to detect minute elevations of serum phenylalanine. If a positive relationship could be documented between elevated serum phenylalanine in the elderly and dementia, would a diet low in phenylalanine help prevent some of the manifestations seen in the elderly with dementia? By carefully following these dietary restrictions, would more of the elderly be able to "age in place" in the community and not have to be institutionalized?
17236244	Aging and brain activation with working memory tasks: an fMRI study of connectivity.	aging	2007-04-??	BACKGROUND: White matter changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders may produce disconnection of neural circuits. Temporal correlations in regional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals may be used to assess effective functional connectivity in specific circuits, such as prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits supporting working memory (WM) tasks. We hypothesized healthy older subjects would show lower connectivity than younger subjects.    METHODS: Healthy younger (n = 9, 25.9 (SD 6.0) years) and older adults (n = 11, 68.3 (4.9) years) performed WM tasks during functional MRI. Subjects viewed images and were instructed to label them, either simultaneously or after a delay; BOLD responses with and without delay were contrasted to assess differential WM activation and connectivity. Two tasks were used: a semantic task, with line drawings categorized as 'alive' or 'not living', and an emotional task, with emotive faces as stimuli and subjects selecting the better emotional descriptio…
8259262	Stability of normal and aging lens gamma crystallins.	aging	1993-??-??	Fluorescence polarization and near UV circular dichroism (CD) studies were performed on four purified human gamma crystallin fractions derived from normal (eye bank lenses) ranging in age from the first decade through the seventh decade. All the four young (first decade) gamma crystallins had higher polarization values compared with the old (sixth and seventh decade) fractions: in addition, the CD spectra of the gamma I and II crystallins show substantial aging differences; marked decrease in intensity of the negative tryptophan band near 290 nm. While this effect is much less pronounced in the gamma III and IV fractions, aging changes in other areas of some of these fractions also occur. These data demonstrate significant alterations occurring in the human gamma crystallins associated with the normal aging process. Specific conformational alterations are proposed to account for these changes.
11114677	Prevalence of anemia in elderly subjects living at home: role of micronutrient deficiency and inflammation.	aging	2000-11-??	OBJECTIVE: Aging is associated with increased risk of developing anemia and micronutrient deficiencies. Wheat-based staple foods are iron fortified in Chile. We aimed to establish the prevalence and etiology of anemia in apparently healthy free-living elderly subjects.    DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study was performed in an outpatient clinic of Santiago, Chile.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A group of 274 subjects (93 men, 181 women)>/=60 y old living at home and apparently healthy was studied. Clinical and anthropometric evaluations and dietary survey were performed. Complete blood count, and status of iron, copper, folate, vitamins B12 and A and C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured.    RESULTS: Prevalence of anemia was 5.4% for men and 4.4% for women. Subjects with inflammatory process had a higher prevalence of anemia (22.2% men, 31.6% women). Abnormal serum retinol (<0.35 micromol/l) was found in 13.7% of men and 15.9% of women. Prevalence of f…
12714261	DNA damage recognition and repair capacities in human naïve and memory T cells from peripheral blood of young and elderly subjects.	lifespan	2003-04-??	T cells accumulate genetic damage over time but nai;ve cells display higher genomic stability and longer lifespan as compared to memory cells. We found in nai;ve and memory T cells from young and elderly subjects that DNA damage in unirradiated cells is higher in memory than in nai;ve T cells, and is increased by radiation in both cell types. Repair of the radiation-induced DNA damage was much higher in nai;ve than in memory T cells from young subjects but null in both cell types from elderly subjects. Molecular mechanisms involved in DNA damage recognition and repair were analyzed in both cell subsets from young subjects. The intracellular distribution and amount of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex components (ku 70, ku 80, DNA-PKcs), which are involved in the recognition and repair of DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiations, V(D)J recombination and isotype switching, was assessed in nai;ve and memory T cells from young subjects. While the expression of ku 70 and ku …
19797692	Triceps surae contractile properties and firing rates in the soleus of young and old men.	aging	2009-12-??	Mean maximal motor unit firing rates (MUFRs) of the human soleus are lower (5-20 Hz) than other limb muscles (20-50 Hz) during brief sustained contractions. With healthy adult aging, maximal MUFRs are 20-40% lower and twitch contractile speed of lower limb muscles are 10-40% slower compared with young adults. However, it is unknown whether the inherently low maximal MUFRs for the soleus are further reduced with aging in association with age-related slowing in contractile properties. The purpose of the present study was to compare the changes in triceps surae contractile properties and MUFRs of the soleus throughout a variety of contraction intensities in six old ( approximately 75 yr old) and six young ( approximately 24 yr old) men. Neuromuscular measures were collected from the soleus and triceps surae during repeated sessions (2-6 sessions). Populations of single MUFR trains were recorded from the soleus with tungsten microelectrodes during separate sustained 6- to 10-s isometric co…
2089434	Photochemical and photophysical studies on human lens constituents.	aging	1990-10-??	The young human lens contains species (3-hydroxy kynurenine; 3-HK and its glucoside; 3-HKG) which absorb most light between 300 and 400 nm. Photochemical studies have indicated that these compounds are relatively inefficient sensitizers of lens proteins. An investigation of the fluorescent properties of 3-HKG indicate that it contains a fast deactivation pathway (ps) which would be expected to have minimal photochemical effect on the integrity of the lens. Further phot physical studies on 3-HK indicates that it has an even faster fluorescent lifetime (less than 10 ps) with a much lower quantum yield of fluorescence (0.001 vs 0.03 for 3-HKG). With aging, the human lens proteins undergo numerous changes including a generalized yellowing. These chromophores exhibit a higher quantum yield of fluorescence, an increase in the fluorescent lifetime by 2 orders of magnitude and the formation of two long lived transient species (microsecond). These species might be expected to drastically increa…
11915921	Master athletes.	aging	2001-12-??	Over the past 3 decades, there has been a continued increase in the number of "older" participants in sporting events such as running, swimming, cycling, rowing, and weightlifting. Some master athletes come from a background with years of training and competition experience, while others have only begun to compete as they approach middle-aged and older. The majority of what we currently know about master athletes and aging has been gained from both cross-sectional and longitudinal testing and re-testing master athletes and recreational athletes. The focus of this paper is on the physiological profile of athletes and individuals performing regular exercise training. Physiological data from elite and non-elite, recreational, sedentary, and senior athletes clearly indicate that human skeletal muscle has a high degree of plasticity that is maintained late into life. Muscle fiber protein expression and single muscle fiber contractile properties are greatly influenced by exercise training. I…
26568155	Association analysis of insulin-like growth factor-1 axis parameters with survival and functional status in nonagenarians of the Leiden Longevity Study.	longevity	2015-11-??	Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 - 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was ass…
3583321	Alterations of the FMLP-induced Ca2+ efflux from human monocytes with aging.	aging	1987-04-??	The Ca2+ with the calmodulin system plays a major role in the receptor-induced intracellular biochemical events. Thus, as in our previous studies, we found an altered postreceptorial coupling in the case of elderly, we were interested to elucidate the Ca2+ transport in the case of healthy young (less than 25 years) and aged (greater than 65 years) subjects. The chemotactic peptide FMLP was used for receptor stimulation. Our data show that both spontaneous and FMLP-triggered Ca2+ extrusion measured on monocyte monolayers is decreased with aging. The FMLP-triggered Ca2+ extrusion nevertheless did not occur through the TFP-sensitive pathway. These alterations of Ca2+ transport seem to indicate an impaired Ca2+-calmodulin function in monocytes with aging.
28363111	3T hippocampal glutamate-glutamine complex reflects verbal memory decline in aging.	aging	2017-??-??	The hippocampus is a critical site for alterations that are responsible for age-related changes in memory. Here, we present a relatively novel approach of examining the relationship between memory performance and glutamate-glutamine levels using short echo time magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between Glx (a composite of glutamate and glutamine) levels in the hippocampus, performance on a word-recall task, and resting-state functional connectivity. While there was no overall difference in Glx intensity between young and aging adults, we identified a positive correlation between delayed word-list recall and Glx, bilaterally in older adults, but not in young adults. Collapsed across age, we also discovered a negative relationship between Glx intensity and resting-state functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and regions in the subcallosal gyrus. These findings demonstrate the possible utility of Glx in identifying age-relate…
21971945	Effects of an aging pulmonary system on expiratory flow limitation and dyspnoea during exercise in healthy women.	aging	2012-06-??	Aging related changes in pulmonary function may make older women (OW) more susceptible to expiratory flow limitation (EFL) and lead to higher dyspnoea ratings during exercise relative to young women (YW). Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare sensory responses and EFL susceptibility and magnitude in 8 YW (29 ± 7 years) and 8 healthy OW (64 ± 3 years) matched for percentage-predicted forced vital capacity (% predicted FVC) and % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s. EFL was calculated as the percent overlap between tidal flow-volume loops during maximal exercise and the maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve. Peak oxygen consumption (V'O(2peak)) was lower in the OW compared to the YW (29.4 ± 3.6 vs. 49.1 ± 8.9 ml kg(-1) min(-1), P < 0.05) as was maximal ventilation (73.7 ± 18.4 vs. 108.7 ± 14.1 l min(-1), P < 0.05). EFL at maximal exercise was present in 2 of 8 YW and in 5 of 8 OW. There were no significant differences in the magnitude of EFL between OW (23 ± 2…
3719947	Cyanocobalamin absorption in the elderly: results for healthy subjects and for subjects with low serum cobalamin concentration.	aging	1986-07-??	We examined the intestinal absorption of cyano[57Co]cobalamin from a non-protein-bound test dose given to 38 subjects from a population of elderly. The subjects were 76 years old and were apparently free from conditions known to affect cyanocobalamin absorption. Their gastric mucosal function was normal, as judged from determinations of serum gastrin and pepsinogen I. The urinary excretion of radioactivity during the first 24 h was 24(SD 7)%, range 8.6 to 45.2%, corresponding to a health-associated reference interval of 10 to 38%. The results indicate that cyanocobalamin absorption does not decline during normal aging. Duplicate studies were performed in another 20 subjects (70-81 years old) from the same population study; these subjects had a serum cobalamin concentration less than 130 pmol/L. The imprecision (CV) was 23%.
26965008	Single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to mitochondrial uncoupling protein genes UCP2 and UCP3 affect mitochondrial metabolism and healthy aging in female nonagenarians.	aging	2016-??-??	Energy expenditure decreases with age, but in the oldest-old, energy demand for maintenance of body functions increases with declining health. Uncoupling proteins have profound impact on mitochondrial metabolic processes; therefore, we focused attention on mitochondrial uncoupling protein genes. Alongside resting metabolic rate (RMR), two SNPs in the promoter region of UCP2 were associated with healthy aging. These SNPs mark potential binding sites for several transcription factors; thus, they may affect expression of the gene. A third SNP in the 3'-UTR of UCP3 interacted with RMR. This UCP3 SNP is known to impact UCP3 expression in tissue culture cells, and it has been associated with body weight and mitochondrial energy metabolism. The significant main effects of the UCP2 SNPs and the interaction effect of the UCP3 SNP were also observed after controlling for fat-free mass (FFM) and physical-activity related energy consumption. The association of UCP2/3 with healthy aging was not fou…
12714264	The role of IL-1 gene cluster in longevity: a study in Italian population.	longevity	2003-04-??	In this study, we analysed the polymorphic variants of IL-1alpha (C-T transition at position -889), IL-1beta (C-T transition at position -511) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (Ra) (86-bp repeated sequence in intron 2) in 1131 subjects (453 females and 678 males) from Northern and Central Italy, including 134 centenarians, to evaluate whether IL-1 cluster alleles might be differently represented in people selected for longevity. In addition, IL-1Ra and IL-1beta plasma levels were quantified by ELISA in 130 randomly selected subjects. No significant differences in the genotype and allele frequency distributions were observed between young, elderly and centenarian subjects. IL-1Ra plasma levels showed an age-related increase, whereas IL-1beta plasma levels did not show any detectable age-related trend. Neither IL-1Ra nor IL-1beta plasma levels showed any relationship with genotypes of the three IL-1 genes. These results suggest that no one particular polymorphism in the IL-1 gene cluster yie…
15268755	Signal transduction and functional changes in neutrophils with aging.	aging	2004-08-??	It is well known that the immune response decreases during aging, leading to a higher susceptibility to infections, cancers and autoimmune disorders. Most widely studied have been alterations in the adaptive immune response. Recently, the role of the innate immune response as a first-line defence against bacterial invasion and as a modulator of the adaptive immune response has become more widely recognized. One of the most important cell components of the innate response is neutrophils and it is therefore important to elucidate their function during aging. With aging there is an alteration of the receptor-driven functions of human neutrophils, such as superoxide anion production, chemotaxis and apoptosis. One of the alterations underlying these functional changes is a decrease in signalling elicited by specific receptors. Alterations were also found in the neutrophil membrane lipid rafts. These alterations in neutrophil functions and signal transduction that occur during aging might co…
8177095	Sertoli cell function declines earlier than Leydig cell function in aging Japanese men.	aging	1994-02-??	In order to evaluate the age-related changes in Leydig cell and Sertoli cell function, we measured serum levels of total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), inhibin, LH and FSH in 116 healthy Japanese men, aged 24-92 years. Serum TT remained constant up to the age of 80 years and decreased thereafter. Serum FT declined linearly with aging and was significantly lower in men in their forties than in younger men (24-39 years old). Serum inhibin levels also declined with aging, with serum concentrations significantly lower in men older than 40 and markedly lower in men over 80 years old. LH and FSH were elevated in men over 60 and 40 years old, respectively. We also examined relationships between gonadotropins and gonadal hormones in these men divided into three age groups, young (24-39 years old), middle aged (40-59 years old) and aged (60-92 years old) men. Although there was a significant inverse correlation between LH and TT or FT for the entire population, subset analysis demon…
24695208	Changes in spatial extent and peak double optical density of human macular pigment with age.	aging	2014-04-01	The purpose of the present work was to estimate the changes in spatial distribution and optical density of macular pigment (MP) with age. A fundus imaging system with high spatial and spectral resolution was adapted to form an indirect ophthalmoscope. The double optical density at 490 nm of the MP as a function of the location in the retina was obtained for 33 healthy subjects (ages: 21-60 years). There was an increase in spatial extent and decrease in double optical density with age. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of MP showed central areas with irregular shapes and a tendency toward asymmetry.
28377157	Age effects on associative memory for novel picture pairings.	aging	2017-??-01	Normal aging is usually accompanied by greater memory decline for associations than for single items. Though associative memory is generally supported by recollection, it has been suggested that familiarity can also contribute to associative memory when stimuli can be unitized and encoded as a single entity. Given that familiarity remains intact during healthy aging, this may be one route to reducing age-related associative deficits. The current study investigated age-related differences in associative memory under conditions that were expected to differentially promote unitization, in this case by manipulating the spatial arrangement of two semantically unrelated objects positioned relative to each other in either spatially implausible or plausible orientations. Event-related potential (ERP) correlates of item and associative memory were recorded whilst younger and older adults were required to discriminate between old, recombined and new pairs of objects. These ERP correlates of item…
22579682	The cortisol awakening response and memory performance in older men and women.	aging	2012-12-??	The activity and regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis has been related to cognitive decline during aging. This study investigated whether the cortisol awakening response (CAR) is related to memory performance among older adults. The sample was composed of 88 participants (44 men and 44 women) from 55 to 77 years old. The memory assessment consisted of two tests measuring declarative memory (a paragraph recall test and a word list learning test) and two tests measuring working memory (a spatial span test and a spatial working memory test). Among those participants who showed the CAR on two consecutive days, we found that a greater CAR was related to poorer declarative memory performance in both men and women, and to better working memory performance only in men. The results of our study suggest that the relationship between CAR and memory performance is negative in men and women when memory performance is largely dependent on hippocampal functioning (i.e. declarative me…
23648586	Metabolic changes in the auditory cortex in presbycusis demonstrated by MR spectroscopy.	aging	2013-08-??	In humans, aging is accompanied by the deterioration of the hearing function--presbycusis. The major etiology for presbycusis is the loss of hair cells in the inner ear; less well known are changes in the central auditory system. Therefore, we used 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T tomograph to examine metabolite levels in the auditory cortex of three groups of subjects: young healthy subjects less than 30 years old and subjects older than 65 years either with mild presbycusis corresponding to their age or with expressed presbycusis. Hearing function in all subjects was examined by pure tone audiometry (125-16,000 Hz). Significant differences were found in the concentrations of glutamate and N-acetylaspartate, with lower levels in aged subjects. Lactate was particularly increased in subjects with expressed presbycusis. Significant differences were not found in other metabolites, including GABA, between young and elderly subjects. The results demonstrate that the age-related chan…
20678465	Validation model for Raman based skin carotenoid detection.	aging	2010-12-01	Raman spectroscopy holds promise as a rapid objective non-invasive optical method for the detection of carotenoid compounds in human tissue in vivo. Carotenoids are of interest due to their functions as antioxidants and/or optical absorbers of phototoxic light at deep blue and near UV wavelengths. In the macular region of the human retina, carotenoids may prevent or delay the onset of age-related tissue degeneration. In human skin, they may help prevent premature skin aging, and are possibly involved in the prevention of certain skin cancers. Furthermore, since carotenoids exist in high concentrations in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and are routinely taken up by the human body through the diet, skin carotenoid levels may serve as an objective biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake. Before the Raman method can be accepted as a widespread optical alternative for carotenoid measurements, direct validation studies are needed to compare it with the gold standard of high perfor…
7572737	Age-related impairments in the regulation of food intake.	aging	1995-11-??	Low food intake in elderly individuals increases the risk for many nutrition-related acute or chronic illnesses. It is not known whether aging is associated with changes in hunger and satiety, or whether elderly individuals can regulate energy intake in response to manipulations of the energy or nutrient content of foods. Therefore, this study investigated short-term energy regulation in healthy elderly (n = 16; aged 60-84 y) and young (n = 16; aged 18-35 y) men. Participants were given yogurt preloads that varied in energy and macronutrient content (low-fat, low-energy, 962 kJ; high-fat, high-energy, 2134 kJ; high-carbohydrate, high-energy 2134 kJ), or no yogurt, followed by a self-selected lunch (presented 30 min after subjects began to consume the yogurt). Energy intake, the percentage of macronutrients consumed in the meals, and subjective sensations of hunger and satiety were analyzed. The elderly men consumed significantly less energy than the young men in the baseline (no yogurt…
19587110	Age-dependent regression analysis of male gonadal axis.	aging	2009-11-??	The mechanisms by which aging progressively depletes testosterone (Te) availability in the male are unknown. Accordingly, the objective was to estimate brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) outflow (release and action), which cannot be observed directly, on the basis of downstream effects on pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. LH, in turn, feeds forward on (stimulates) gonadal Te secretion, which then feeds back on (inhibits) GnRH-driven LH secretion. LH and Te concentrations were measured repetitively (every 10 min) over 18 h during graded pharmacological blockade of endogenous GnRH outflow in 24 healthy 20- to 72-yr-old men. Data were analyzed using a new age-dependent regression model of GnRH-LH-Te interactions to estimate pulsatile LH secretion and elimination, GnRH outflow, LH feedforward, and Te feedback. By incorporating regression on age within the dose-response model, we show that aging erodes all three primary forward and reverse pathways linking the brain, pi…
8970515	Iodine-123-IPT SPECT imaging of CNS dopamine transporters: nonlinear effects of normal aging on striatal uptake values.	aging	1996-12-??	UNLABELLED: Iodine-123-labeled IPT (N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane) is an analog of cocaine that selectively binds the presynaptic dopamine transporter. This study sought to characterize changes in the striatal uptake of IPT with normal aging.    METHODS: The sample included 18 healthy human volunteers. Their ages ranged from 19 to 67 yr. Dynamic SPECT scans of the brain were acquired with about 185 MBq (5 mCi) of IPT on a triple-headed camera. The images were reconstructed with a three-dimensional restorative filter and corrected for attenuation. The mean concentration of radioactivity [microCi/ml] was measured in the head of the caudate and body of the putamen. The remainder of the supratentorial brain was used as a reference.    RESULTS: The specific uptake of IPT was higher in the caudate than in the putamen of each subject. It decreased significantly with age in both regions. The mean specific uptake in seven volunteers who were less than …
28255110	Methylome-wide association study of whole blood DNA in the Norfolk Island isolate identifies robust loci associated with age.	aging	2017-??-28	Epigenetic regulation of various genomic functions, including gene expression, provide mechanisms whereby an organism can dynamically respond to changes in its environment and modify gene expression accordingly. One epigenetic mechanism implicated in human aging and age-related disorders is DNA methylation. Isolated populations such as Norfolk Island (NI) should be advantageous for the identification of epigenetic factors related to aging due to reduced genetic and environmental variation. Here we conducted a methylome-wide association study of age using whole blood DNA in 24 healthy female individuals from the NI genetic isolate (aged 24-47 years). We analysed 450K methylation array data using a machine learning approach (GLMnet) to identify age-associated CpGs. We identified 497 CpG sites, mapping to 422 genes, associated with age, with 11 sites previously associated with age. The strongest associations identified were for a single CpG site in  and an extended region within the promo…
10855597	Epidemiology of sarcopenia.	aging	2000-06-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine patterns of muscle mass change with aging and to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.    SETTING: Population-based study in Rochester, Minnesota.    PARTICIPANTS: Age-stratified sample of men and women from the community.    MEASUREMENTS: Muscle mass estimated from total body scans by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sarcopenia was defined as muscle mass more than 2 standard deviations below the sex-specific young-normal mean.    RESULTS: Total lean body mass (exclusive of bone) and total skeletal muscle mass both were greater in men than women and declined linearly with age as judged from these cross-sectional data. Adjustment for height reduced the gender difference. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 6 to 15% among subjects 65 years of age or over, depending on the muscle mass parameter that was evaluated, but prevalence rates were quite sensitive to the normal values used to define cutoff level…
12880787	Age dependency of the hemodynamic response as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy.	aging	2003-07-??	Aging reduces cerebral blood flow in association cortices during rest. However, the influence of age on functional brain activation is still controversial. The aim of our study was to examine age dependency of brain activation in primary and association cortices. Therefore, changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin as well as changes in the redox state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (Cyt-Ox) were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the lateral prefrontal and motor cortices during an event-related Stroop interference task. Fourteen young (23.9 +/- 3.1 years old) and 14 elderly subjects (65.1 +/- 3.1) participated in the study. Data revealed two effects of aging on brain activation: (1) Elderly and young subjects used the lateral prefrontal cortex to cope with interference during the Stroop task. In young subjects, the vascular response was higher during incongruent than neutral trials in the entire examined lateral prefrontal cortex. However, in the elde…
4038409	Somatomedin-C levels in healthy young and old men: relationship to peak and 24-hour integrated levels of growth hormone.	aging	1985-01-??	We investigated the relationship between growth hormone secretion and somatomedin levels as a function of age in normal healthy men. There was a substantial decrease with age in somatomedin levels from 0.95 +/- 0.06 (M +/- SEM) units/ml in young (23 to 27 years) men to 0.68 +/- 0.07 in old (58 to 82 years) men. The blood samples were taken throughout a 24-hour period, so it was possible to analyze the data for correlations between average somatomedin levels and various aspects of growth hormone secretion. There was a significant correlation of somatomedin level with the 24-hour integrated growth hormone level, and a nearly significant correlation with the sum of the highest three peaks, but no correlation with the highest nighttime peak or the basal level of growth hormone. These lower blood levels of somatomedin in the aged may be responsible, at least in part, for the catabolic effects on muscle and bone frequently associated with aging.
10795725	Effect of age and menopause on serum concentrations of pentosidine, an advanced glycation end product.	aging	2000-03-??	BACKGROUND: Pentosidine is an advanced glycation end product. Our aim is to investigate (a) the age-related change of serum pentosidine and (b) the effect of menopause on serum pentosidine.    METHODS: Using the high-performance liquid-chromatography method with column switching, we measured serum pentosidine in 140 healthy women aged 20-93 years. Serum creatinine was also measured. The samples of 13 young and 13 old subjects were used for the measurements of free pentosidine and fractions of pentosidine. Free pentosidine was measured without hydrolysis, and the fractions were measured with a 10,000 mol wt cutoff filter. To investigate the effect of menopause on pentosidine, two biochemical markers for bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin) were measured in age-matched premenopausal and postmenopausal women (16 in each group).    RESULTS: Serum pentosidine significantly increased with age (r = .702, p < .0001 ). The values of serum pentosidine for the groups beyond the age of 50 were sign…
1641768	Effect of age on wound healing in healthy human beings.	aging	1992-08-??	BACKGROUND: Although the elderly clinically have a higher rate of wound complications, the physiologic effect of age on wound healing in human beings is unknown.    METHODS: Healthy young (18 to 55 years of age) and elderly (more than 65 years of age) human volunteers had a 2 x 2 cm, superficial, split-thickness wound created on the anterior aspect of the thigh, and the rate of epithelialization was assessed. For studies of fibroplasia, similar groups underwent subcutaneous implantation of polytetrafluoroethylene catheters, which were removed after 14 days. Biochemical analyses of the catheters included determinations of hydroxyproline, total alpha-amino nitrogen, and DNA.    RESULTS: The elderly volunteers had a significant delay of 1.9 days in epithelialization. Analyses of the subcutaneously implanted catheters showed no difference in DNA content or hydroxyproline-accumulation; however, the young volunteers had a significantly higher amount of total alpha-amino nitrogen.    CONCLUSI…
12495254	Nutrition and the extremes of life: dilemmas and enigmas of advanced old age.	longevity	2002-??-??	Pre-term infants born four months before term have a very low birth weight; in an evolutionary sense, they were never 'meant' to survive through the evolutionary period preceding the technological age. In the same way, evolution failed to contemplate survival to ages 50, 60, 70 and beyond. Because peak reproductive performance comes before the vagaries of a given individual's survival is determined, and the fact of that survival conveys no advantage to disseminating the genetic make-up, natural selection cannot select for advantages related to longevity. Moreover, in the larger context of species survival and biodiversity, the crowding of the human ecosphere with older persons would seem to have had more liabilities than assets over evolution. We cannot learn from nature how to feed and nourish the oldest old. The lessons, if any, would be cruelly averse to our humanitarian values. However, we do have values and they guide us to the goal for quality of life for the assorted conditions …
12606003	Circadian rhythm characteristics of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in healthy Chinese men aged 30 to 60 years. A cross-sectional study.	aging	2003-02-??	The relation of adrenal function and aging has been the subject of intense interest in recent years. The circadian variations of plasma cortisol have been described in Caucasians, but little information is available on such hormone variations among the Chinese population, especially its changes with age. This study was, therefore, designed to examine the effects of age on the circadian variations of serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and the molar ratio of cortisol/DHEAS in Chinese men, stratified by 10-year age-groups (i.e. men in their 30-60s, aged from 31 to 63 years old). Circadian variations of serum cortisol and DHEAS were documented at 2-h intervals from 8:00 to 22:00 and hourly from 22:00 to 8:00 in 26 healthy Chinese men. We found that the serum levels of both hormones showed a statistically significant circadian rhythmicity in all age-groups. The circadian pattern of serum cortisol was characterized by peaks (04:00-06:00) and troughs (18:00-24:00) occurrin…
17727699	The mitochondrial DNA control region shows genetically correlated levels of heteroplasmy in leukocytes of centenarians and their offspring.	longevity	2007-08-29	BACKGROUND: Studies on heteroplasmy occurring in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) in leukocytes of centenarians and younger subjects have shown that the C150T somatic transition is over-represented in centenarians. However, whether the occurrence/accumulation of heteroplasmy is a phenotypic consequence of extreme ageing or a genetically controlled event that may favor longevity is a question that deserves further attention. To clarify this point, we set up a Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) protocol to quantify mtDNA CR heteroplasmy. We then analyzed heteroplasmy in leukocytes of centenarians (100 subjects), their offspring and nieces/nephews (200 subjects, age-range 65-80 years, median age 70 years), and in leukocytes of 114 control subjects sex- and age-matched with the relatives of centenarians.    RESULTS: The centenarians and their descendants, despite the different ages, showed similar levels of heteroplasmy which were significantly highe…
15247016	Evidence of preferential protein targets for age-related modifications in peripheral blood lymphocytes.	aging	2004-06-??	Oxidatively modified proteins have been analyzed in aging human peripheral blood lymphocytes since protein modification by oxidation and other related pathways are believed to contribute to the intracellular age-related accumulation of damaged proteins, a process that has been associated with the cellular functional deficits that occur with age. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) were quantified and the pattern of glycated proteins analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using an anti-AGE antibody raised against glycated RNAse. The protein silver stain and the immunoblot patterns were not superimposable, indicating that glycoxidative modifications are targeting only a restricted set of proteins. Modification of proteins with the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal has also been studied. The patterns of modified proteins have been analyzed using two- dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with an antibody recognizi…
8495228	Stimulation of human embryonic lung fibroblasts by TGF-beta and PDGF acting in synergism. The role of cell density.	aging	1993-01-??	The concerted action of TGF-beta and PDGF on a diploid human embryonic lung fibroblast cell strain (Flow 2002) grown in an homologous environment is investigated here. In sparse cultures, TGF-beta stimulates DNA synthesis over a broad concentration range (0.1-10 ng/ml). Furthermore, it acts in synergism with PDGF, a phenomenon which persists also during in vitro aging of the cells. Preincubation of TGF-beta with the fibroblasts up to 12 hours reduces the subsequent PDGF binding to the cells, while prolonged preincubation restores PDGF binding to control levels. Finally, in cultures of higher cell densities, TGF-beta ceases to stimulate DNA synthesis, whereas PDGF continues even at cell confluency, retains its stimulatory activity suggesting different roles for the two growth factors during the wound healing process.
12074934	Age-related decline of serotonin transporters in living human brain of healthy males.	aging	2002-07-05	There is growing interest in serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function in the human brain, since alteration in 5-HTT has been suggested in a variety of neurophychiatric disorders. Age-related decline in postsynaptic 5-HT receptors has been demonstrated in postmortem human studies and in vivo imaging studies, and has been assumed to be related to changes in mental function in the normal aging process. However, few studies have investigated the aging effect on 5-HTT in human brain in vivo, since the availability of suitable ligands has been limited. To investigate the aging effect on 5-HTT in living human brain, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a selective ligand for 5-HTT, [11C](+)McN5652. We examined 28 healthy male volunteers aged between 20 and 79 years. The uptake was quantified in the thalamus and midbrain by graphical analysis with the cerebellum as a reference tissue, and binding potential (BP) was used for the index of 5-HTT binding. There was a significan…
22936786	Lifestyle, social factors, and survival after age 75: population based study.	longevity	2012-08-29	OBJECTIVE: To identify modifiable factors associated with longevity among adults aged 75 and older.    DESIGN: Population based cohort study.    SETTING: Kungsholmen, Stockholm, Sweden.    PARTICIPANTS: 1810 adults aged 75 or more participating in the Kungsholmen Project, with follow-up for 18 years.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Median age at death. Vital status from 1987 to 2005.    RESULTS: During follow-up 1661 (91.8%) participants died. Half of the participants lived longer than 90 years. Half of the current smokers died 1.0 year (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 1.9 years) earlier than non-smokers. Of the leisure activities, physical activity was most strongly associated with survival; the median age at death of participants who regularly swam, walked, or did gymnastics was 2.0 years (0.7 to 3.3 years) greater than those who did not. The median survival of people with a low risk profile (healthy lifestyle behaviours, participation in at least one leisure activity, and a rich or moderate…
23522494	Body weight, anorexia, and undernutrition in older people.	aging	2013-09-??	Ideal body weight for maximum life expectancy increases with advancing age. Older people, however, tend to weigh less than younger adults, and old age is also associated with a tendency to lose weight. Weight loss in older people is associated with adverse outcomes, particularly if unintentional, and initial body weight is low. When older people lose weight, more of the tissue lost is lean tissue (mainly skeletal muscle) than in younger people. When excessive, the loss of lean muscle tissue results in sarcopenia, which is associated with poor health outcomes. Unintentional weight loss in older people may be a result of protein-energy malnutrition, cachexia, the physiological anorexia of aging, or a combination of these. The physiological anorexia of aging is a decrease in appetite and energy intake that occurs even in healthy people and is possibly caused by changes in the digestive tract, gastrointestinal hormone concentrations and activity, neurotransmitters, and cytokines. A greater…
2532866	Atrial natriuretic factor in the elderly: diminished response to epinephrine.	aging	1989-12-??	We have previously found that epinephrine (EPI) increases plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (irANF) in young human subjects. Because elderly humans have decreased sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation, we compared plasma irANF responses to intravenous infusion of EPI, 5 micrograms/min for 80 min in six young (ages 20-29) and nine old (ages 62-75) healthy subjects. In addition, we measured plasma irANF responses of the nine old subjects to 1 liter of normal saline infused over 30 min. Young and old subjects had similar basal EPI levels [108 +/- 18 vs. 106 +/- 10 (SE) pg/ml], but basal irANF levels tended to be higher in the old (32 +/- 7 vs. 50 +/- 8 pmol/l, P = 0.15). The young subjects had a significant increase in irANF levels after the EPI infusion (32 +/- 7 vs. 59 +/- 11 pmol/l, P less than 0.02), but there was no change in irANF in the old (50 +/- 8 vs. 48 +/- 7 pmol/l) despite similar plasma EPI levels in young and old (1,125 +/- 57 vs. 1,183 +/- 52 pg/ml). In contr…
10656182	Immune function did not decline with aging in apparently healthy, well-nourished women.	aging	1999-12-07	Nutrition plays a crucial role in immune function. Most studies on age-associated changes in immunocompetence in healthy adults did not examine the nutritional status of participants extensively. Inadequate nutritional status may confound the relationship of aging and immune response. The purpose of this study was to examine age-related changes in parameters of acquired and innate immunity in healthy and generally well-nourished older (62-88 years) versus younger (20-40 years) women. Subjects were screened for participation using the health criteria of the SENIEUR protocol as well as a number of nutrition criteria related to undernutrition, and protein, iron, vitamin B12, and folate status. Young and old women did not differ in total T (CD3+), T-helper (CD4+), or T-cytotoxic (CD8+) cell number. However, older women tended to have lower T-cell proliferation response to concanavalin A (P < 0.10) and significantly reduced response to phytohemagglutinin (P < 0.05). No age-related changes w…
16213688	Human muscle aging: ROS-mediated alterations in rectus abdominis and vastus lateralis muscles.	aging	2005-12-??	Aging is related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage. Considering the heterogeneity of age-related changes and the involvement of muscles in different functions, we compared the aging process in different functional muscles. We studied age-related changes in rectus abdominis (RA) and vastus lateralis (VL) in subjects of different age (18-48- and 66-90-year-old). We analysed fiber distribution, antioxidant enzymatic systems: Mn and CuZn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), catalase (CAT), as well as oxidative damage markers: lipoperoxide levels (LPO), carbonylated proteins (CP), reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH, GSSG) content and the GSH/GSSG ratio. In the muscles analysed, type I fiber increases during aging with a consequent decrease in type II distribution. In the elderly group RA MnSOD showed higher activity than VL. Furthermore, in RA MnSOD was higher in the elder group than in the younger group. CuZn…
8000292	Modelling tissue behaviour based on hyperelasticity theory.	aging	1994-??-??	The tissues are during their physiological function, e.g., in the course of growth, adolescence, and aging, subjected to a cyclic mechanical loading and to large displacements and rotations as well. A tissue free of all external tractions is in a state that minimizes its internal power. In the course of aging of the tissues, for instance in the wall of the aorta, the vein, and also in the myocardium or heart valves, the decrease of the water content and increase of the collagen content occurs; while in compact and trabecular bone the contents of both mineral substances and collagen, undergo reduction. In accordance with it, the strain energy function and the constitutive equations of living tissue based on the hyperelasticity theory using rotationless strain were studied. On the base of the proposed eigenvalue decomposition of the rotationless strain tensor and hyperelasticity the strain energy function was formulated as depending on biological time of tissue. The quantity of strain en…
23946336	Comparison between southern blots and qPCR analysis of leukocyte telomere length in the health ABC study.	aging	2014-05-??	Only a few studies, primarily limited to small samples, have examined the relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) data generated by Southern blots, expressed in kilobases, versus quantitative PCR data, expressed in the telomere product/a single gene product (T/S). In the present study, we compared LTL data generated by the two methods in 681 elderly participants (50% African Americans, 50% of European origin, 49.2% women, mean age 73.7±2.9 years) in the Health Aging and Body Composition Study. The correlation between the data generated by the two methods was modest (R (2) = .27). Both methods captured the age effect on LTL and the longer LTL in women than in men. However, only the Southern blot method showed a significantly longer LTL in African Americans than in European decent individuals, which might be attributed to the larger measurement error of the quantitative PCR-based method than the Southern blots.
20026186	Linking cognitive aging to alterations in dopamine neurotransmitter functioning: recent data and future avenues.	aging	2010-04-??	Molecular-imaging studies of dopaminergic neurotransmission measure biomarkers of dopamine (DA), such as the DA transporter and D(1) and D(2) receptor densities in the living brain. These studies indicate that individual differences in DA functions are linked to cognitive performance irrespective of age, and serve as powerful mediators of age-related decline in executive functioning, episodic memory, and perceptual speed. This focused review targets several recent findings pertaining to these relationships. Specifically, we discuss novel evidence concerning (a) the role of DA in within-person cognitive variability; (b) age-related differences in DA release during cognitive processing; (c) DA release following cognitive training in younger and older adults; and (d) the relationship between DA and task-induced functional brain activity. Based on these lines of empirical inquiry, we outline a series of avenues for future research on aging, DA, and cognition.
18806290	Lipoprotein particles of intraocular origin in human Bruch membrane: an unusual lipid profile.	aging	2009-02-??	PURPOSE: Throughout adulthood, Bruch membrane (BrM) accumulates esterified cholesterol (EC) associated with abundant 60- to 80-nm-diameter lipoprotein-like particles (LLP), putative apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoproteins secreted by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the present study, neutral lipid, phospholipids, and retinoid components of human BrM-LLP were assayed.    METHODS: Particles isolated from paired choroids of human donors were subjected to comprehensive lipid profiling (preparative liquid chromatography [LC] gas chromatography [GC]), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Western blot analysis, and negative stain electron microscopy. Results were compared to plasma lipoproteins isolated from normolipemic volunteers and to conditioned medium from RPE-J cells supplemented with palmitate to induce particle synthesis and secretion.    RESULTS: EC was the largest component (32.4+/-7.9 mol%) of BrM-LLP lipids. EC was 11.3-fold more a…
16155279	Short-term weight changes in community-dwelling older adults: the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Weight Change Substudy.	aging	2005-09-??	BACKGROUND: The frequency and short-term natural history of weight loss in community-dwelling older adults have not been described. Unintentional weight loss may be more likely to continue than intentional weight loss.    OBJECTIVES: The present substudy described the frequency of a > or = 5% loss or gain in body weight in community-dwelling older adults at an annual examination of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study and 6 mo later. The weight-management practices used by the participants were also described.    DESIGN: A total of 522 older adults with either a > or = 5% weight gain (n = 116) or a > or = 5% weight loss (n = 171) in the previous year were compared with a random sample of weight-stable older adults (< 5% weight loss or gain, n = 235) at the fourth annual visit of the ongoing Health ABC Study. The participants' weight-loss intention and weight-management practices were assessed by an interview. The participants' weight was reassessed 6 mo later.    …
15036396	Skeletal muscle gene expression profiles in 20-29 year old and 65-71 year old women.	aging	2004-03-??	Gene expression profiling may provide leads for investigations of the molecular basis of functional declines associated with aging. In this study, high-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to probe the patterns of gene expression in skeletal muscle of seven young women (20-29 years old) and eight healthy older women (65-71 years old). The older subjects had reduced muscle mass, strength, and peak oxygen consumption relative to young women. There were approximately 1000 probe sets that suggested differential gene expression in younger and older muscle according to statistical criteria. The most highly overexpressed genes (>3-fold) in older muscle were p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A), which might reflect increased DNA damage, perinatal myosin heavy chain, which might reflect increased muscle fiber regeneration, and tomoregulin, which does not have a defined function in muscle. More than 40 genes encoding proteins that bind to pre-mRNAs or mRNAs were expressed at higher lev…
9104885	Serum osteocalcin and bone mineral density at various skeletal sites: a study performed with three different assays.	aging	1997-04-??	The purposes of this study were threefold: (1) to compare values obtained by three conventional radioimmunoassays for serum bone-gla-protein (BGP) in a population of normal women, (2) to study the relationship between serum BGP and bone mineral density (BMD) measured at four different skeletal sites (lumbar spine, proximal femur, proximal and ultradistal radius), and (3) to compare the results obtained by the three assays with conventional markers of bone turnover. Ninety-seven normal women (age range 25 to 75 years, mean +/- 1 SD = 54.3 +/- 10.9 years) were studied. Three independent assays were used to measure serum osteocalcin levels: a heterologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) (A) (Incstar Co., Stillwater, Minn.), a homologous RIA (B) (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, Calif.), and a two-site immunoradiometric assay (C) (Cis Biointernational, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Mean +/- SD values of serum osteocalcin in the group as a whole were 4.05 +/- 1.37 microg/L by assay A, 6.03 +/- 2.9…
6751586	Steps toward the development of generalized equations for predicting body composition of adults.	aging	1982-09-??	The estimation of body density from anthropometric variables is often used to measure body composition. The purpose of this report was to review the development of early published equations and follow the transition from population specific equations to generalized equations for adults. The accuracy of population specific equations were improved and refined with the addition of circumference and diameter measures in combination with skinfolds and the use of populations of varied ages and degrees of body fatness. The major weakness of the population specific equations was their inability to account for aging and the non linear relationship between subcutaneous fat and body density. Regression models using the quadratic sum of skinfolds and age have been developed to account for these sources of variation. Cross-validation research has shown that these generalized regression models are accurate for adult males and females varying greatly in age and body fatness.
24470107	Circulating mitochondrial DNA increases with age and is a familiar trait: Implications for "inflamm-aging".	aging	2014-05-??	Mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), when released extracellularly, can act as "damage-associated molecular pattern" (DAMP) agents and cause inflammation. As many elderly people are characterized by a low-grade, chronic inflammatory status defined "inflamm-aging," we evaluated if circulating mtDNA can contribute to this phenomenon. Eight hundred and thirty-one Caucasian subjects were enrolled in the study, including 429 siblings aged 90-104 (90+ siblings). mtDNA plasma levels increased gradually after the fifth decade of life. In 90+ subjects, mtDNA values of two members of the same sibling relationship were directly correlated, suggesting a role for familiar/genetic background in controlling the levels of circulating mtDNA. The subjects with the highest mtDNA plasma levels had the highest amounts of TNF-α, IL-6, RANTES, and IL-1ra; the subjects with the lowest mtDNA levels had the lowest levels of the same cytokines. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with mtD…
24862021	Aging as alteration.	longevity, aging	2014-??-??	Aging is a normative biological process, and not simply a physical one. It is not accurate to define it by the fact that life has an entropic cost, and to characterize it as a pure imbalance between exergonic and endergonic reaction in metabolism (the free radical theory of aging) or finally as an imbalance between the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species and limited antioxidant defenses. In connective tissues, aging is alteration. And alteration is more than destruction or degradation. It deals with self-destruction and with the so-called molecular vicious circles of aging. In worms, in yeast, and in other organisms, aging is also opposed to longevity that counteracts this self-destruction process, as if longevity was something like a developmental constraint (delay) opposed to an evolutionary one (alteration).
21305446	Inhibition of stromelysin-1 by caffeic acid derivatives from a propolis sample from Algeria.	aging	2011-07-??	Stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3: MMP-3) occupies a central position in collagenolytic and elastolytic cascades, leading to cutaneous intrinsic and extrinsic aging. We screened extracts of a propolis sample from Algeria with the aim to isolate compounds able to selectively inhibit this enzyme. A butanolic extract (B (3)) of the investigated propolis sample was found to potently inhibit MMP-3 activity (IC (50) = 0.15 ± 0.03 µg/mL), with no or only weak activity on other MMPs. This fraction also inhibited plasmin amidolytic activity (IC (50) = 0.05 µg/mL) and impeded plasmin-mediated proMMP-3 activation. B (3) was fractionated by HPLC, and one compound, characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopy and not previously identified in propolis, i.e., (+)-chicoric acid, displayed potent IN VITRO MMP-3 inhibitory activity (IC (50) = 6.3 × 10 (-7) M). In addition, both caffeic acid and (+)-chicoric acid methyl ester present in fraction B (3) significantly inhibited UVA-mediated MMP-3 upre…
16390747	Decline of serum levels of free testosterone in aging healthy Chinese men.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the age-related change of serum androgen levels in healthy men and to define a cut-off value of serum testosterone for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency in the aging male.    METHOD: 1080 healthy men aged 20 to 70 years old were enrolled in Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Chongqing. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (T), calculated free testosterone (cFT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), 17beta-oestradiol (E2), the T/LH ratio, and T/SHBG as a free testosterone index (FTI) were all determined.    RESULTS: Serum total T did not significantly decline, but the cFT, T/LH and FTI progressively decreased with aging. To determine androgen deficiency, the 10th percentile value of men < 40 years was defined as the lower cut-off value for cFT, T/LH or FTI, which were 0.3 nmol/L, 2.8 nmol/IU, and 0.4 nmol/IU respectively. With the median value of cFT of men aged between 20 and 49 years as the criterion, the level of cFT w…
16624961	Amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are inversely coupled during regulation of negative affect and predict the diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion among older adults.	aging	2006-04-19	Among younger adults, the ability to willfully regulate negative affect, enabling effective responses to stressful experiences, engages regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala. Because regions of PFC and the amygdala are known to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, here we test whether PFC and amygdala responses during emotion regulation predict the diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol secretion. We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older (62- to 64-year-old) rather than younger individuals. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated (increased or decreased) their affective responses or attended to negative picture stimuli. We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol assay. Consistent with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala a…
28523359	Arginine CGA codons as a source of nonsense mutations: a possible role in multivariant gene expression, control of mRNA quality, and aging.	aging	2017-10-??	Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA of higher eukaryotes, including humans, creates "hot spots" of C→T transitions in the genome. The predominantly methylated sequence in mammalian DNAs is CG (CpG). Among CG-containing codons, CGA codons for arginine are unique due to their ability to create stop codons TGA (UGA in mRNA) upon epigenetic-mediated mutation. As such nonsense mutations can have a strong adverse effect on the cell and organism, we have performed a study, on the example of human genes, aimed to characterise the anticipated effects of epigenetic-mediated nonsense mutations CGA→TGA in somatic cells. It is commonly accepted that premature termination codons (PTCs) lead to the biosynthesis of truncated and usually inactive proteins. In addition, transcripts with PTC can be destroyed by a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) machinery. We have considered the cell potentialities (gene families, diploidy, and alternative splicing) to overcome the worst consequences of nonsense mu…
1630155	Phytohemagglutinin induced changes of membrane lipid packing, c-myc and c-myb encoded protein expression in human lymphocytes during aging.	aging	1992-06-??	Three parameters which signal different stages of cell activation were analyzed in lymphocytes from young and old subjects. Merocyanine 540 (MC-540) incorporation into the membrane lipid phase was used as a very early marker of activation and was measured after 1 h of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. The proteins coded by c-myc and c-myb protooncogenes were determined by appropriate antibodies and were taken as markers of the G0/G1 and G1/S phase transition, respectively. The number of cells which increased the uptake of MC-540 following PHA stimulation did not differ when comparing young and old individuals. Both the number of the responding cells and the size of the response were decreased during aging when the presence of the c-myc protein was taken into account. A consistent decrease of the percentage of lymphocytes able to express the c-myb protein was observed in the cells from old donors as compared to those from the young ones, but the amount of detectable protein per cell…
26820977	Relative Leukocyte Telomere Length, Hematological Parameters and Anemia - Data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: The length of the chromosome ends, telomeres, is widely accepted as a biomarker of aging. However, the dynamic of the relationship between telomere length and hematopoietic parameters in the normal aging process, which is of particular interest with respect to age-related anemia, is not well understood.    OBJECTIVE: We have analyzed the relationship between relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) and several hematological parameters in the older group of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) participants. This paper also compares rLTL between both BASE-II age groups (22-37 and 60-83 years).    METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of BASE-II participants and used to determine rLTL by a quantitative PCR protocol. Standard methods were used to determine blood parameters, and the WHO criteria were used to identify anemic participants.    RESULTS: Telomere length data were available for 444 younger participants (28.4 ± 3.1 years old; 52% women) an…
1059082	Aspartic acid racemization in tooth enamel from living humans.	aging	1975-08-??	The aspartic acid in human tooth enamel shows increasing racemization with age. This increase is not seen in the metabolically active protein hemoglobin. The rate constant for the racemization reaction of aspartic acid in human tooth enamel was found to be 8.29 X 10(-4) yr-1. This rate constant suggests that in any protein with a long in vivo lifetime, D-aspartic acid will accumulate with age (about 8% of total aspartic acid in enamel will be the D-enantiomer after 60 years). Thus, racemization may play some role in the aging process affecting metabolically stable tissues in long-lived homeotherms. Aspartic acid racemization in toogh enamel also provides a biochronological tool for assessing the age of living mammals.
20965260	Unified segmentation based correction of R1 brain maps for RF transmit field inhomogeneities (UNICORT).	aging	2011-02-01	Quantitative mapping of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1=1/T1) in the human brain enables the investigation of tissue microstructure and macroscopic morphology which are becoming increasingly important for clinical and neuroimaging applications. R1 maps are now commonly estimated from two fast high-resolution 3D FLASH acquisitions with variable excitation flip angles, because this approach is fast and does not rely on special acquisition techniques. However, these R1 maps need to be corrected for bias due to RF transmit field (B1(+)) inhomogeneities, requiring additional B1(+) mapping which is usually time consuming and difficult to implement. We propose a technique that simultaneously estimates the B1(+) inhomogeneities and R1 values from the uncorrected R1 maps in the human brain without need for B1(+) mapping. It employs a probabilistic framework for unified segmentation based correction of R1 maps for B1(+) inhomogeneities (UNICORT). The framework incorporates a physically info…
17210145	An evaluation of distinct volumetric and functional MRI contributions toward understanding age and task performance: a study in the basal ganglia.	aging	2007-03-02	Prior work by our group and others has implicated the basal ganglia as important in age-related differences in tasks involving motor response control. The present study used structural and functional MRI approaches to analyze this region of interest (ROI) toward better understanding the contributions of structural and functional MRI measures to understanding age-related and task performance-related cognitive differences. Eleven healthy elders were compared with 11 healthy younger adults while they completed the "go" portion of a complex Go/No-go task. Separate ROI's in the bilateral caudate (C) and putamen/globus pallidus (PGp) were studied based upon previous findings of age-related functional MRI differences in basal ganglia for this portion of the task. Structural volumes and functional activation (in percent area under the curve during correct responses) were independently extracted for these ROI's. Results showed that age correlated with ROI volume in bilateral PGp and C, while mu…
8706782	Effect of age on the fatty acid composition of phospholipids in human lymphocytes.	aging	????-??-??	We have examined the fatty acid composition of phospholipids of unstimulated and PHA-stimulated T cells from young and old donors. Our results demonstrate that aging is accompanied by decreases in the saturated fatty acids, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, and a concomitant increase in the unsaturated arachidonic acid. Following activation with PHA for 24 h, age-associated differences in fatty acids could no longer be detected. In contrast to the lymphocyte, aging did not affect the fatty acid composition of either serum or neutrophil phospholipids. Exposure of lymphocytes from old donors to myristic acid complexed medium increased the levels of myristate in the phospholipids to levels similar to that seen in lymphocytes from young donors. We conclude from these studies that aging is accompanied by an alteration in the fatty acid profiles of phospholipids, and that incubation in myristic acid complexed medium modulates these profiles. These alterations are unique to lymphocytes and ma…
26609179	Age-Related Sex-Specific Changes in Brain Metabolism and Morphology.	aging	2016-02-??	UNLABELLED: With a large database, we aimed to evaluate sex-specific distinctive changes in brain glucose metabolism and morphology during normal aging using MRI and (18)F-FDG PET.    METHODS: A total of 963 cognitively healthy adults were included in this study. All subjects completed a medical questionnaire, took the mini-mental state examination, and underwent brain MRI and whole-body (18)F-FDG PET. The MR and PET images were statistically analyzed using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection. All images were corrected for whole-brain pixel value to identify the brain regions with significant changes, and regions of interest were set up with reference to Brodmann areas. We evaluated morphologic and glucose metabolic changes by cross-sectional analysis. The baseline database consisted of subjects from 30 to 40 y old, and the age-step for comparison was 5-y ranges. We also compared sex-specific differences in MR and PET images in each age group.    RESULTS: Regarding age-relate…
19302371	Race/ethnicity and telomere length in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.	aging	2009-06-??	Telomere length has emerged as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and aging. Race/ethnic differences in telomere length have been infrequently investigated. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was assessed 981 white, black and Hispanic men and women aged 45-84 years participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Direct measurement and questionnaire were used to assess covariates. Linear regression was used to estimate associations of LTL with race/ethnicity and age after adjustment for sex, income, education, smoking, physical activity, diet and body mass index. On average blacks and Hispanics had shorter telomeres than whites [adjusted mean differences (standard error) in T/S ratio compared to whites: -0.041 (0.018) for blacks and -0.044 (0.018) for Hispanics]. Blacks and Hispanics showed greater differences in telomere length associated with age than whites (adjusted mean differences in T/S ratio per 1 year increase in age -0.0018, -0.0047 and -0.0055 in whites, blacks…
2387677	Lipids in human lipofuscin-enriched subcellular fractions of two age populations. Comparison with rod outer segments and neural retina.	aging	1990-08-??	The fatty acid composition and content of total phospholipids, free fatty acids (FFA), diacylglycerols (DG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were studied in lipofuscin granules of human donors in two age groups, young (less than 40 yr old) and old (more than 47 yr old), and compared with lipids of the photoreceptor rod outer segments (ROS). Neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also were studied. In both age groups, the lipid composition of the lipofuscin granules differed from that of the ROS, with a decrease in the proportion of phospholipid and an increase in FFA, suggesting very high phospholipase activity in the lipofuscin granules. In ROS, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) was the predominant FFA, whereas palmitic acid (16:0), arachidonic acid (20:4) and oleic acid (18:1) were the major fatty acids in the lipofuscin granules. The fatty acid compositions of PC, PE, and PS of lipofuscin granules were different from th…
12870155	Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-binding proteins-1 and -3 in middle-aged and young athletes versus sedentary men: relationship with glucose disposal.	aging	2003-07-??	The goal of this study was to characterize the respective effects of aging and endurance training on serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), as well as IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP)-1 and -3 in relationship with glucose disposal. Thirty-two subjects (16 middle-aged men: 8 cyclists and 8 sedentary men; and 16 young men: 8 cyclists and 8 sedentary men) were compared in this study. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (Sg) were assessed by the minimal model. Endurance training increased SI, Sg, and IGFBP-1 and -3 in both age groups (P<.05), but the older group showed a greater increase in SI and IGFBP-1 than the younger group (P<.05). IGF-I was increased only in the middle-aged trained men (P<.05). An effect of aging was found in the sedentary subjects, who presented lower IGF-I and SI (P<.05) when older. This effect disappeared with training since IGF-I and SI were nearly identical in young and middle-aged trained subjects. SI was correlated with IGFBP-1 (P<.01). These d…
17935071	Correlation between recent thymic emigrants and CD31+ (PECAM-1) CD4+ T cells in normal individuals during aging and in lymphopenic children.	aging	2007-11-??	CD31(+)CD45RA(+)RO(-) lymphocytes contain high numbers of T cell receptor circle (TREC)-bearing T cells; however, the correlation between CD31(+)CD4(+) lymphocytes and TREC during aging and under lymphopenic conditions has not yet been sufficiently investigated. We analyzed TREC, telomere length and telomerase activity within sorted CD31(+) and CD31(-) CD4(+) lymphocytes in healthy individuals from birth to old age. Sorted CD31(+)CD45RA(+)RO(-) naive CD4(+) lymphocytes contained high TREC numbers, whereas CD31(+)CD45RA(-)RO(+) cells (comprising < or =5% of CD4(+) cells during aging) did not contain TREC. CD31(+) overall CD4(+) cells remained TREC rich despite an age-related tenfold reduction from neonatal (100 : 1000) to old age (10 : 1000). Besides a high TREC content, CD31(+)CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) cells exhibited significantly longer telomeres and higher telomerase activity than CD31(-)CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) cells, suggesting that CD31(+)CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) cells represent a distinct po…
11677367	Is the somatotropic axis related to sympathetic nerve activity in healthy ageing men?	aging	2001-11-??	OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms underlying the age-related increase in blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity remain largely unknown. The decline in growth hormone (GH) secretion and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) with age has been related to several cardiovascular risk factors. Low serum IGF-I levels in severe adult GH deficiency is associated with markedly increased sympathetic nerve activity. This study evaluates whether a relationship between serum IGF-I and sympathetic nerve traffic exists in healthy aging men.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Sympathetic nerve activity to the muscle vascular bed (MSA) was recorded in 56 healthy normotensive males, and related to age (range 21-71 years), body mass index (BMI, range 18.4-32.2), serum IGF-I and plasma nitrate levels. Blood pressure, BMI and MSA increased with age, whereas IGF-I and plasma nitrate decreased. In a forward stepwise multiple regression analysis, age explained 40% of the variability in MSA and excluded other variables. Omit…
23033137	Influence of aging on the quality of the skin of white women: the role of collagen.	aging	2012-10-??	PURPOSE: Evaluate the influence of aging on the quality of the skin of white women, analyzing the dermal collagen.    METHODS: Pre-auricular flaps were collected for histological and morphometric analysis of 218 white women who underwent spontaneous facial aesthetic plastic surgery. Picrosirius ultrared stain was used for analysis and quantification of collagen in five age groups (<40 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years and 70 to 79 years) .    RESULTS: Histological analysis showed changes suggestive of skin aging (fragmentation and disorganization of collagen fibers), especially in patients over 60 years. There were no significant changes in the relationship of age with the thickness of the dermis and epidermis, but there was with the percentage of the collagen I, III and total (p<0.001), which decreased with increasing aging.    CONCLUSION: There is reduction in collagen with increasing age, and an increase in its degradation, leading to fragmentation of the fibers.
18387547	Cerebral blood flow regulation during cognitive tasks: effects of healthy aging.	aging	2008-02-??	Aging is associated with frontal subcortical microangiopathy and executive cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that elderly individuals may have impaired metabolic activation of cerebral blood flow to the frontal lobes. We used transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to examine the cerebral blood flow response to executive control and visual tasks in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations and to determine the effects of healthy aging on cerebral blood flow regulation during cognitive tasks. Continuous simultaneous anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) blood flow velocities (BFVs) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured in response to word stem completion (WSC) and a visual search (VS) task in 29 healthy subjects (14 young, 30+/-1.5 years; 15 old, 74+/-1.4 years). We found that: (1) ACA and PCA blood flow velocities are both significantly increased during WSC and VS cognitive tasks, (2) ACA and PCA activations were task specific in our young vol…
26700637	Isomerization of Asp residues plays an important role in αA-crystallin dissociation.	aging	2016-03-??	Aged cataract formation is caused by the accumulative precipitation of lens proteins incorporating diverse post-translational modifications. α-Crystallin, a major structural and functional lens protein, consists of a large polymeric structure that is dissociated and insolubilized with accumulative post-translational modifications. One such modification, isomerization of Asp, was recently identified in αB-crystallin monomers derived from aged lens. However, the distributions of Asp isomers in each lens fraction remain unknown. Here, α-crystallin fractions from aged lens were separated into heteropolymeric and monomeric forms to determine the Asp isomerization ratios in each fraction. Lens of four different ages were homogenized and centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was applied to size-exclusion chromatography. The heteropolymeric α-crystallin and monomeric crystallin fractions were obtained and concentrated. After trypsin digestion, each fraction was independently applied to liquid …
19202126	Skewing of X-inactivation ratios in blood cells of aging women is confirmed by independent methodologies.	aging	2009-04-09	Nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), also known as skewing, has been documented in the blood cells of a significant proportion of normal aging women by the use of methylation-based assays at the polymorphic human androgen receptor locus (HUMARA). Recent data obtained with a new transcription-based XCI determination method, termed suppressive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has shed controversy over the validity of XCI ratio results obtained with HUMARA. To resolve this disparity, we analyzed XCI in polymorphonuclear leukocytes of a large cohort of women aged 43 to 100 years with the use of HUMARA (n=100), a TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay (n=90), and the suppressive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (n=67). The 3 methods yielded similar skewing incidences (42%, 38%, and 40%, respectively), and highly concordant XCI ratios. This confirms that the skewing of XCI ratio seen in blood cells of aging women is a bona fide and robust biologic phenomenon.
2820076	Platelet alpha-adrenoceptor function and aging.	aging	1987-06-01	The effect of aging on platelet alpha-adrenoceptor binding of 3H-dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine (3H-DHE) and alpha-adrenoceptor response expressed as cAMP decrease, after the addition of noradrenaline 10 microM to intact platelets in vitro were examined and correlated with adrenaline induced platelet aggregation in a group of twelve young volunteers (mean age 21 years), and twelve old volunteers (mean age 88 years). The binding by platelets of 3H-DHE was considerably higher in the young than in the old group (mean 292.70 +/- 40.79 and 167.90 +/- 18.30 fmol/mg protein respectively, p less than 0.02). The affinity (Kd) was also influenced with values of 1.49 +/- 0.21 in the young and 3.32 +/- 0.45 nM in the old, p less than 0.01). Stimulation of platelets with noradrenaline caused a greater decrement of cAMP in the old than in the young group (mean 4.44 +/- 0.87 as compared with 0.32 +/- 0.75 pmol/10(9) platelets. Platelet sensitivity to adrenaline, when expressed as aggregation increased in…
16339311	Social relationships, sleep quality, and interleukin-6 in aging women.	aging	2005-12-20	This study examined the interplay of social engagement, sleep quality, and plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a sample of aging women (n = 74, aged 61-90, M age = 73.4). Social engagement was assessed by questionnaire, sleep was assessed by using the NightCap in-home sleep monitoring system and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and blood samples were obtained for analysis of plasma levels of IL-6. Regarding subjective assessment, poorer sleep (higher scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) was associated with lower positive social relations scores. Multivariate regression analyses showed that lower levels of plasma IL-6 were predicted by greater sleep efficiency (P < 0.001), measured objectively and by more positive social relations (P < 0.05). A significant interaction showed that women with the highest IL-6 levels were those with both poor sleep efficiency and poor social relations (P < 0.05). However, those with low sleep efficiency but compensating good relationships …
8603843	Accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deletions in human retina during aging.	aging	1996-02-??	PURPOSE: The authors investigated the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in aging human retina.    METHODS: A quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique for studying the common mtDNA 4977-deletion (delta mtDNA4977) in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retinal (NR) was developed.    RESULTS: Although no deletion was detected in the fetus, every adult RPE and NR had this common deletion. The ratio of the deleted delta mtDNA4977 to the total mtDNA increased significantly in elderly persons 60 to 110 years of age and was greater in peripheral than in central RPE.    CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least one type of mutation accumulates in the mtDNA in the retina during aging, reflecting a general phenomenon of genomic instability that could influence its function.
9523218	Consequences of aging on mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes in cultured human fibroblasts treated with ascorbate.	aging	1998-??-??	The activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes with and without ascorbate pretreatment were assayed in 10- to 20-week-old cultures of human fibroblasts. Aging was associated with a significant loss of respiratory chain enzyme activities. The presence of ascorbate in the medium reduced the rate of loss of these enzymes. Free radical-mediated injuries may also contribute to aging since the changes seen in respiratory chain enzyme activities are similar to those seen in oxidatively stressed cells. This study demonstrates an age-related decline in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity as well as a protective role for ascorbate in aging.
27612602	Soluble sortilin is present in excess and positively correlates with progranulin in CSF of aging individuals.	aging	2016-??-??	Mutations in progranulin are a major cause of frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD). Hence, plasma progranulin is an attractive biomarker in FTLD but poorly reflects levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting tissue-specific regulation of progranulin levels. Sortilin was recently identified as a progranulin scavenger receptor that destines it for lysosomal degradation. Proteolysis or alternative splicing generates soluble sortilin variants that retain progranulin binding and potentially functions as a decoy receptor. In the present study, we analyzed soluble sortilin and progranulin in plasma and CSF in 341 aging individuals. We found that soluble sortilin exists in CSF in ten-fold molar excess compared to progranulin and observed a highly significant positive correlation between soluble sortilin and progranulin levels in CSF but not in plasma. However, carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs646776 in SORT1 encoding sortilin displayed significantly increased soluble sortilin and …
14657209	Age-associated alterations in the recruitment of signal-transduction proteins to lipid rafts in human T lymphocytes.	aging	2004-02-??	Aging is associated with a decline in T cell activation and proliferation, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent findings suggest that lipid rafts act as a platform in the initiation of T cell activation by selectively recruiting signaling proteins associated with formation of the initial complex of signal transduction. We tested the hypothesis that lipid raft properties are altered in T lymphocytes from elderly, healthy individuals in comparison with young subjects. Results showed that the cholesterol content of lipid rafts derived from these cells was consistently higher in the case of elderly donors and that membrane fluidity was decreased. In addition, lipid rafts coalescence to the site of T cell receptor engagement was impaired in T cells from elderly donors. The recruitment of p56(lck), linker of activated T cells, and their tyrosine-phosphorylated forms to lipid rafts was decreased in activated T cells from aged individuals.

26420705	Flow Cytometry Analysis of NK Cell Phenotype and Function in Aging.	aging	2015-??-??	Natural killer (NK) cells represent a subpopulation of lymphocytes involved in innate immunity, defined recently as group 1 of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). NK cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes with a relevant role in the destruction of transformed cells as virus-infected or tumor cells, as well as the regulation of the immune response through cytokine and chemokine production that activates other cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity. In humans, NK cell subsets have been defined according to the level of expression of CD56. Aging differentially affects NK cell subsets and NK cell function. Here, we describe protocols for the delineation of NK cell subsets and the analysis of their functional capacity using multiparametric flow cytometry.
8795665	Relationship of serum IgE concentration to level and rate of decline of pulmonary function: the Normative Aging Study.	aging	1996-08-??	BACKGROUND: Previous reports on the relationship between serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration and the level and rate of decline of pulmonary function in the general population have produced conflicting results. The relationship between total serum IgE concentration and pulmonary function was therefore examined in 1078 men aged 41-86 years followed in the Normative Aging Study.    METHODS: The serum IgE concentration determined at the start of the three year follow up period was examined in relation to both the level and longitudinal rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC.    RESULTS: In a cross sectional analysis restricted to subjects who had ever smoked cigarettes, multiple linear regression models indicated an inverse association between total serum IgE concentration and both FEV1 (beta = -0.090 1/log10 IU/ml; SE = 0.030; p < 0.005) and FVC (beta = -0.110 1/log10 IU/ml; SE = 0.034; p < 0.005) but not FEV1/FVC…
24122149	Longitudinal decline of lower extremity muscle power in healthy and mobility-limited older adults: influence of muscle mass, strength, composition, neuromuscular activation and single fiber contractile properties.	aging	2014-01-??	PURPOSE: This longitudinal study examined the major physiological mechanisms that determine the age-related loss of lower extremity muscle power in two distinct groups of older humans. We hypothesized that after ~3 years of follow-up, mobility-limited older adults (mean age: 77.2 ± 4, n = 22, 12 females) would have significantly greater reductions in leg extensor muscle power compared to healthy older adults (74.1 ± 4, n = 26, 12 females).    METHODS: Mid-thigh muscle size and composition were assessed using computed tomography. Neuromuscular activation was quantified using surface electromyography and vastus lateralis single muscle fibers were studied to evaluate intrinsic muscle contractile properties.    RESULTS: At follow-up, the overall magnitude of muscle power loss was similar between groups: mobility-limited: -8.5 % vs. healthy older: -8.8 %, P > 0.8. Mobility-limited elders had significant reductions in muscle size (-3.8 %, P < 0.01) and strength (-5.9 %, P < 0.02), however, t…
8152318	Alterations of anorectic cytokine levels from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in idiopathic senile anorexia.	aging	1993-12-15	Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of two well-known satiety cytokine peptides have been measured in elderly persons with idiopathic anorexia and normal weight healthy subjects in a similar age range. Plasma and CSF levels of tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were assayed by commercially available kits. Elderly under-weight anorectic patients had significantly lower levels of TNF alpha but unchanged concentrations of IL-1 beta in both plasma and CSF when compared to controls. In addition to significantly lower levels of TNF alpha in CSF, we found a positive correlation between the body mass index and CSF TNF alpha concentrations (r = 0.61, P < 0.05) in the anorectic group. CSF IL-1 beta concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with plasma albumin levels in senile anorectics (r = -0.66, P < 0.05) but not in controls. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that a decrease in plasma and CSF TNF alpha concentration…
11528348	Maximal strength and power, endurance performance, and serum hormones in middle-aged and elderly men.	aging	2001-09-??	PURPOSE: To examine maximal strength, power and muscle cross-sectional area, maximal and submaximal cycling endurance characteristics, and serum hormone concentrations of testosterone (T), free testosterone (FT), and cortisol (C) in middle-aged and elderly men.    METHODS: Maximal knee extension force (isometric; MIF(KE)), power-load curves during concentric actions with loads ranging from 15% to 70% of 1 RM half-squat (1RM(HS)), muscle cross-sectional area of quadriceps femoris (CSA(QF)), workload, heart rate and lactate accumulation during incremental cycling, and serum hormone concentrations were measured in 26 middle-aged (M42 yr) and 21 elderly men (M65 yr).    RESULTS: The 1RM(HS) (14%), MIF(KE) (24%) and CSA(QF) (13%) were lower in M65 than in M42 (P < 0.05-0.01). Power during submaximal actions was lower (P < 0.05-0.001) in M65 than in M42, but the differences disappeared when expressed relative to CSA(QF). Serum FT was in M42 higher (P < 0.05) than in M65. Maximal workload, ma…
10986849	The morbidity compression debate: risks, opportunities, and policy options for women.	aging	2000-??-??	The morbidity compression theory proposes that we can compress the period of illness and disability in old age into an ever smaller period at the end of life. Although recent research offers fresh support for the theory, its validity remains uncertain. This paper demonstrates the importance of the theory and recent research in this area for women. It critiques the chief proponent and opposing views of the theory, and suggests a heightened emphasis on public policies promoting healthy lifestyles. These policies would reduce long-term care needs, save health care dollars, and improve the experience of aging.
1399540	Metabolic changes in bone in old age.	aging	1992-??-??	The authors conducted a study on the effect of aging upon the factors which regulate calcium metabolism. Hormonal and biochemical tests were performed on samples from patients selected on the basis of sex, age, and other characteristics in order to determine the trend of these regulatory factors in middle and old age, with particular attention to osteoporosis in women. The authors propose several theories regarding the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis on the basis of this study as well as the literature.
16236485	Differential role of lipid rafts in the functions of CD4+ and CD8+ human T lymphocytes with aging.	aging	2006-07-??	Lipid rafts are critical to the assembly of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling machinery. It is not known whether lipid raft properties differ in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and whether there are age-related differences that may account in part for immune senescence. Data presented here showed that time-dependent interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was different between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The defect in IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells was not due to lower levels of expression of the TCR or CD28. There was a direct correlation between the activation of p56(Lck) and LAT and their association/recruitment with the lipid raft fractions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. p56Lck, LAT and Akt/PKB were weakly phosphorylated in lipid rafts of stimulated CD4+ T cells of elderly as compared to young donors. Lipid rafts undergo changes in their lipid composition (ganglioside M1, cholesterol) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of elderly individuals. This study emphasizes the differential role of lipid rafts in CD4+ and CD8…
9751430	Nutritional influences on immune response in healthy aged persons.	aging	1998-08-01	Healthy elderly (80+/-5 years) with different nutritional status were compared to young healthy adults (25+/-5 years) to quantify the relative influences of aging and nutrition on immune response. Aged persons, without alteration of their nutritional status, had lower CD3+, CD8+, and CD45RA+ as well as higher CD2+CD3-, CD2+CD4-CD8-, and CD45RO+ T cell subsets and IL-6 release than their younger counterparts. T cell proliferation and IL-2 production were comparable in the two healthiest groups. Aged subjects with low nutritional status expressed similar but more marked changes in immune response while nutritional status did not influence the immune response in young subjects. Furthermore, lower nutritional status was associated with lower CD4+ counts and lower T cell functions in aged persons. These results indicate that the influences of aging and undernutrition in humans are cumulative and suggest that some changes in immune response that have been attributed to aging may, in fact, be…
9173952	Norepinephrine spillover at rest and during submaximal exercise in young and old subjects.	aging	1997-06-??	Aging is associated with elevations in plasma norepinephrine concentrations. The purpose of this investigation was to examine total body and regional norepinephrine spillover as an indicator of sympathetic nerve activity. Eight young (26 +/- 3 yr) and seven old (69 +/- 5 yr) male subjects were studied at rest and during 20 min of submaximal cycling exercise at 50% of peak work capacity. Norepinephrine spillover was determined by continuous intravenous infusion of [3H]norepinephrine. Arterial norepinephrine concentrations were significantly greater at rest for old vs. young subjects (280 +/- 36 vs. 196 +/- 27 ng/ml, respectively). Whereas total norepinephrine spillover did not differ between groups at rest, hepatomesenteric norepinephrine spillover was 50% greater in old subjects compared with their young counterparts (51 +/- 7 vs. 34 +/- 5 ng/min, respectively). Additionally, norepinephrine clearance rates at rest were significantly lower for the old subjects (-23%). During exercise, p…
15105033	Anthropometric measurements in the elderly population of Santiago, Chile.	aging	2004-05-??	OBJECTIVE: There are few studies on anthropometry and nutritional status in large and representative samples of elderly populations in Chile and South America. We describe age and sex differences in weight, height, body mass index, knee height, waist circumference, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, arm muscle area, and calf circumference in Chilean elderly subjects.    METHODS: This was a population-based, cross-sectional study. A total of 1220 elderly persons (819 women and 411 men; age range, 60-99 y) were recruited in the city of Santiago (Chile) through a probabilistic sampling procedure carried out from October to December 1999.    RESULTS: Men were significantly heavier and taller than women in all age groups, whereas body mass index values were significantly higher in women than in men. All anthropometric variables showed a decrease in average values with aging in men and women. The apparent negative slopes for the decline in average values of body weight with ag…
25390294	Sprinters versus long-distance runners: how to grow old healthy.	aging	2015-01-??	So far, aging studies have concentrated on endurance athletes. Master sprint-trained athletes were not the main focus of attention. We propose the novel hypothesis that the sprint model of lifelong physical training that involves high-intensity exercise is at least as beneficial as moderate-intensity endurance exercise for successful aging.
10999822	Measures of bioavailable serum testosterone and estradiol and their relationships with muscle strength, bone density, and body composition in elderly men.	aging	2000-09-??	In the present cross-sectional study of 403 independently living elderly men, we tested the hypothesis that the decreases in bone mass, body composition, and muscle strength with age are related to the fall in circulating endogenous testosterone (T) and estrogen concentrations. We compared various measures of the level of bioactive androgen and estrogen to which tissues are exposed. After exclusion of subjects with severe mobility problems and signs of dementia, 403 healthy men (age, 73-94 yr) were randomly selected from a population-based sample. Total T (TT), free T (FT), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were determined by RIA. Levels of non-SHBG-bound T (non-SHBG-T), FT (calc-FT), the TT/SHBG ratio, non-SHBG-bound E2, and free E2 were calculated. Physical characteristics of aging included muscle strength measured using dynamometry, total body bone mineral density (BMD), hip BMD, and body composition, including lean mass and fat mass, measured by …
1917692	The effects of normal aging on the response of the pituitary-gonadal axis to chronic clomiphene administration in men.	aging	????-??-??	Serum androgens decline with age in normal men, despite normal or elevated bioactive serum gonadotropins, suggesting that primary testicular dysfunction occurs with aging. The authors further assessed the question of age-related testicular dysfunction by evaluating whether raising serum gonadotropins above the normal serum range for an extended time in healthy elderly men might result in bringing their gonadal function to a level similar to that found in young adult men. Five elderly (65 to 85 years old) and five young adult men (26 to 33 years old) were given 50 mg of clomiphene citrate (CC) twice a day for 8 weeks to stimulate gonadotropin production. During that time, testosterone (T), non-sex hormone-binding globulin bound T, and estradiol increased significantly in both age groups, while serum inhibin increased significantly only in the young adult men. The increases in serum androgens with CC administration were significantly greater in the young adult men than in the elderly men…
22032891	Age and cortisol levels modulate judgment of positive and negative facial expressions.	aging	2012-06-??	There is some evidence that older adults respond to emotional stimuli differently to young adults, and that they may exhibit better performance on measures of memory and attention when stimuli are positive rather than negative in valence. A relation between cortisol levels and attention/memory for emotional stimuli in young adults has also been reported. The relationship between cortisol levels and the judgment of facial expressions of emotion in aging, however, has yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate performance on a simple emotional face judgment task in young (N=37) and middle-aged (N=37) adults in association with salivary cortisol levels. Middle-aged participants were slower in responding to stimuli than younger participants. Cortisol levels were found to be associated with shorter response latencies to categorise emotional but not neutral faces, and with a greater tendency to judge neutral faces as being emotional. An interaction between age and cortisol …
16953331	Correlation between zinc status and immune function in the elderly.	aging	????-??-??	Zinc is essential for the immune system and elderly people have an increased probability for zinc deficiency, documented by a decline of serum or plasma zinc levels with age. Although most healthy elderly are not classified as clinically zinc deficient, even marginal zinc deprivation can affect immune function. Several striking similarities in the immunological changes during aging and zinc deficiency, including a reduction in the activity of the thymus and thymic hormones, a shift of the T helper cell balance towards TH2, decreased response to vaccination, and impaired functions of innae immune cells indicate that a wide prevalence of marginal zinc deficiency in elderly people may contribute to immunosenescence. Studies with oral zinc supplementation show the potential to improve the immune response of elderly people by restoration of the zinc levels, showing that balancing the zinc status may be a way to healthy aging. This review summarizes the current literature about zinc suppleme…
24406640	Acute stress impairs recall after interference in older people, but not in young people.	aging	2014-03-??	Stress has been associated with negative changes observed during the aging process. However, very little research has been carried out on the role of age in acute stress effects on memory. We aimed to explore the role of age and sex in the relationship between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity to psychosocial stress and short-term declarative memory performance. To do so, sixty-seven participants divided into two age groups (each group with a similar number of men and women) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a control condition in a crossover design. Memory performance was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). As expected, worse memory performance was associated with age; but more interestingly, the stressor impaired recall after interference only in the older group. In addition, this effect was negatively correlated with the alpha-amylase over cortisol ratio, which has recently been…
18988298	The integrate model of emotion, thinking and self regulation: an application to the "paradox of aging".	lifespan	2008-09-??	This study was undertaken using the INTEGRATE Model of brain organization, which is based on a temporal continuum of emotion, thinking and self regulation. In this model, the key organizing principle of self adaption is the motivation to minimize danger and maximize reward. This principle drives brain organization across a temporal continuum spanning milliseconds to seconds, minutes and hours. The INTEGRATE Model comprises three distinct processes across this continuum. Emotion is defined by automatic action tendencies triggered by signals that are significant due to their relevance to minimizing danger-maximizing reward (such as abrupt, high contrast stimuli). Thinking represents cognitive functions and feelings that rely on brain and body feedback emerging from around 200 ms post-stimulus onwards. Self regulation is the modulation of emotion, thinking and feeling over time, according to more abstract adaptions to minimize danger-maximize reward. Here, we examined the impact of dispos…
25416114	The quantum human central neural system.	aging	2015-??-??	In this chapter we present Excess Entropy Production for human aging system as the sum of their respective subsystems and electrophysiological status. Additionally, we support the hypothesis of human brain and central neural system quantumness and we strongly suggest the theoretical and philosophical status of human brain as one of the unknown natural Dirac magnetic monopoles placed in the center of a Riemann sphere.
22974317	Aging has greater impact on anaerobic versus aerobic power in trained masters athletes.	aging	2013-??-??	This study measured the relative rates of change of the three human energy systems across a 30-year age range. A cross-section of highly trained masters cyclists (n = 156 males and 17 females; 35-64 years) were tested for maximal cycling performance. There were 50 (29%) track sprint cyclists and the remaining (71%) were predominantly road cycling specialists. A 10 s peak power test measured anaerobic power, a 30 s test measured anaerobic capacity, and a progressive test to volitional fatigue was used to determine peak aerobic power. Participants' exercise patterns were recorded using a physical activity recall questionnaire. Linear regression showed significant changes in anaerobic performance with aging. Peak anaerobic power (W · kg⁻¹) declined at a rate (mean ± SEE) of 8.1 ± 4.1% per decade (P < 0.0001) and anaerobic capacity (kJ · kg⁻¹) declined at 8.0 ± 3.3% per decade (P < 0.0001). Peak aerobic power [W · kg⁻¹] did not change significantly with age [-1.8 ± 1.5% per decade (P = 0.2…
716979	Skeletal muscle metabolism and ultrastructure in relation to age in sedentary men.	aging	1978-11-??	In order to find out if there are age-related changes in human skeletal muscle metabolism or ultrastructure, biopsy material from 56 sedentary men aged 22-65 years was studied by means of enzyme activity determinations, histochemistry and quantitative electron microscopy. For comparison, a younger (16-18 years) and an older (66-76 years) group were included. These subjects were relatively more active. There was an increase in percentage of slow twitch fibres with age. Mitochondrial volume fraction decreased with age, primarily due to diminished mean mitochondrial volume. In spite of this, no overall decrease in the activities of five enzymes, representative of the major pathways in energy metabolism, was observed. Thus, increased amounts of enzymes per unit mitochondrial volume are implicated. Lipofuscin was more frequently found in the older groups. Correlations were present between fibre type distribution and oxidative enzymes, as well as between different enzymes. It was concluded, …
15006678	A database of [(18)F]-altanserin binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors in normal volunteers: normative data and relationship to physiological and demographic variables.	aging	2004-03-??	This study presents the results of an analysis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptors in 52 healthy subjects. Thirty men and twenty-two women aged between 21 and 79 years were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and [(18)F]-altanserin positron emission tomography (PET). The distribution volumes of specific tracer binding (DV(3)') was calculated for 15 brain regions using either cerebellum or pons as reference regions and correlations between DV(3)' and physiological and demographic variables were made. The regional distribution of [(18)F]-altanserin binding in the healthy human brain was in agreement with existing in vitro post-mortem human 5-HT(2A) data. Apart from nonspecific cerebellar binding (DV(2)), there was no gender difference in 5-HT(2A) binding. A positive correlation between cerebellar binding and age was observed and negative correlations between age and DV(3)' were found in all cortical regions, except occipital cortex, corresponding to a decrease in D…
29775745	Analysis of neurotrophic and antioxidant factors related to midbrain dopamine neuronal loss and brain inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid of the elderly.	aging	2018-??-??	Midbrain dopamine neuronal loss and neuroinflammation are two phenomena that are associated with brain senescence. Neurotrophic factor changes and oxidative stress could subserve these phenomena. Aging-related brain changes can be well monitored through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The objective was to analyze neurotrophic and oxidative parameters that could be related to midbrain dopamine neuronal loss or brain inflammation in the CSF of elderly subjects: 1) levels of the dopaminotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, persephin, and neurturin, 2) levels of the proinflammatory factors TGFβ and TGFβ; 3) activity of main antioxidant enzymes (catalases, glutathione-peroxidase, glutathione-reductase, glutathione-S-transferases, peroxirredoxins, and superoxide-dismutases), 4) ferritin content, antioxidant protein which reduces reactive free iron, and 5) antioxidant potential of the cerebrospinal fluid. ELISA and PAO tests were used. Subjects were also evaluated clinically, and the group of old subje…
6377860	Radiologic changes of the aging brain and skull.	aging	1984-08-??	Computed tomographic (CT) studies during life reveal the involutionary changes in the brain found in postmortem studies. Beginning about the fourth decade, gradual widening of the third ventricle, sylvian and interhemispheric fissures, superficial sulci, and basal cisterns occurs. Enlargement of the lateral ventricles is most striking after the sixth decade of life. Regression of the brain with aging is a normal process. There is marked individual variation in the degree of involutional changes; not all lives are identical, and the longer the life span the less predictable one would expect the involutionary changes to be.
448173	Aging and cultured human skin fibroblasts.	aging	1979-07-??	We have studied aging at the cellular level by examining skin fibroblast cultures derived from skin biopsy samples obtained from old and young members of a longitudinal study on human aging. Results from a number of studies already completed indicate that cell cultures from old human donors, unlike cultures from young donors, have impaired cell proliferation and reduced induction of sister chromatid exchanges. A number of other parameters, however, are not affected by the age of the human fibroblast donor. These include cell protein and RNA content and the rate of cellular macromolecular synthesis. Studying cell cultures derived from members of an ongoing longitudinal study permits examination of correlations between in vivo and in vitro measurements on the same people. In addition, it allows for future longitudinal studies on human cellular aging.
1815302	Growth hormone secretion in aging. Effect of pyridostigmine on growth hormone responsiveness to growth hormone-releasing hormone.	aging	1991-12-??	Recent studies in adults have shown that cholinergic enhancement by pyridostigmine (PD) has a stimulatory effect on growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). PD probably reduces somatostatin release from the hypothalamus by increasing the central cholinergic tone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PD (120 mg orally) or placebo pretreatment on GH responsiveness to GHRH (1 micrograms/kg b.w. i.v.) or placebo in 10 normal elderly males (68-92 years). PD induced a significant increase in GH secretion (GH peak 7.3 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L, mean +/- SEM) over the basal value (0.9 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01) and enhanced GH response to GHRH (peak after GHRH: 17.0 +/- 3.8 micrograms/L; after PD plus GHRH: 42.6 +/- 12.2 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). There was a significant difference in the secretory areas of GH among tests (P less than 0.05). The secretory area was greater after PD plus GHRH (2722 +/- 801 micrograms/L/120 min) than after GHRH (11…
17561266	Effect of age on brain oxygenation regulation during changes in position.	aging	2007-08-30	INTRODUCTION: Reports indicate that brain regulation of oxygenation is inhibited in patients with low baseline oxyhemoglobin concentrations and that brain oxyhemoglobin concentrations are decreased with aging. The purpose of this study was to determine if regulation of brain oxygenation to changes in blood pressure is inhibited by normal aging.    METHODS: Brain oxyhemoglobin (OHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) concentrations were determined from the forehead using a frequency domain near infrared spectroscopy in 27 healthy volunteers. Subjects were separated into two groups by age (20-39, n=16; 40-60, n=11). Brain hemoglobin and non-invasive blood pressure were measured in (1) supine, (2) sitting, (3) supine and (4) sitting positions with 10-min equilibration intervals between each determination. Statistical differences were determined by two way repeated measures analysis of variance.    RESULTS: Young subjects were 28+/-5 years (mean+/-S.D.) and older subjects were 48+/-6 years. In supi…
18832152	Gene expression changes in the course of normal brain aging are sexually dimorphic.	lifespan, aging	2008-10-07	Gene expression profiles were assessed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior-frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus across the lifespan of 55 cognitively intact individuals aged 20-99 years. Perspectives on global gene changes that are associated with brain aging emerged, revealing two overarching concepts. First, different regions of the forebrain exhibited substantially different gene profile changes with age. For example, comparing equally powered groups, 5,029 probe sets were significantly altered with age in the superior-frontal gyrus, compared with 1,110 in the entorhinal cortex. Prominent change occurred in the sixth to seventh decades across cortical regions, suggesting that this period is a critical transition point in brain aging, particularly in males. Second, clear gender differences in brain aging were evident, suggesting that the brain undergoes sexually dimorphic changes in gene expression not only in development but also in later life. Globally across all brain …
15894316	cDNA microarray reveals signaling pathways involved in hormones expression of human pituitary.	aging	2005-09-01	Pituitary, a master gland of neuroendocrine system, secretes hormones that orchestrate many physiological processes, under the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. To investigate the genes involved in hormones expression of human pituitary, homemade cDNA microarray containing 14,800 human genes/ESTs were used to profile the gene expression in both fetal and adult pituitaries. Seven hundred and twelve known genes changed over 2-fold between the both tissues. Of which, 23 genes were changed with hormones expression in aging were confirmed by RT-PCR, not only the known regulators such as Pit1, GATA4, ESRRA, GABA-A, and EMK, but also LOC55884, DUSP3, PNN, and RCL, which had not been reported to be involved in the hormones expression. Correspondingly, the mRNAs of GH, PRL, POMC, TSH-beta, FSH-beta, and LH-beta, was increased as much as 6- to 20-fold in adult pituitary than those in fetal pituitary, by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. In addition, the mRNAs of signaling pathways, s…
9567018	Possible role of lens collagen in cataractogenesis.	aging	1997-12-??	The solubility characteristics of collagen in human cataractous eye lenses were studied in relation to age. Post-operative cataractous lenses were collected form eye camps in Phulbani district of Orissa. These were preserved in 70% alcohol and immediately transferred to the laboratory. Various fractions in the collagen obtained from lens capsule of each lens sample were estimated. The salt-soluble and the acid-soluble collagens showed positive correlation with age. The insoluble and total capsular collagen increased with increasing age. The solubility percentage of collagen in salt and acid solutions decreased significantly with increasing age. The possible role of lens collagen in the development of cataract with increasing age is discussed in the background of cross-link theory of aging.
1304337	Gangliosides in the human brain development and aging.	aging	1992-04-??	In this study, brain gangliosides in prenatal and postnatal human life were analyzed. Immunohistochemically, the presence of "c"-pathway of gangliosides (GQ1c) in embryonic brain was only recorded at 5 weeks of gestation. Biochemical results indicated a twofold increase in human cortex ganglioside concentration between 16 and 22 weeks of gestation. The increasing ganglioside concentration was based on an increasing GD1a ganglioside fraction in all regions analyzed except cerebellar cortex, which was characterized by increasing GT1b. In this developmental period, GD3 was found to be localized in the ventricular zone of the cortical wall. After birth, GD1b ganglioside in neuropil of granular cell layer corresponding to growing mossy fibers was expressed in cerebellar cortex. Between birth and 20/30 years of age, a cerebral neocortical difference of ganglioside composition was observed, characterized by lowest GD1a in visual cortex. Analyzing the composition of gangliosides in cortical re…
25569961	Supervised method for construction of microRNA-mRNA networks: application in cardiac tissue aging dataset.	aging	2014-??-??	MicroRNAs play an important role in regulation of gene expression, but still detection of their targets remains a challenge. In this work we present a supervised regulatory network inference method with aim to identify potential target genes (mRNAs) of microRNAs. Briefly, the proposed method exploiting mRNA and microRNA expression trains Random Forests on known interactions and subsequently it is able to predict novel ones. In parallel, we incorporate different available data sources, such as Gene Ontology and ProteinProtein Interactions, to deliver biologically consistent results. Application in both benchmark data and an experiment studying aging showed robust performance.
8065511	Calpain activity in adult and aged human brain regions.	aging	1994-05-??	We assayed calpain activity in 27 human brain regions from adult (43-65 years of age) and aged (66-83 years of age) postmortem tissue samples. Calpain I (microM Ca-requiring) activity was 10% or less of the total activity; it was below detectable levels in a number of areas, and so data are are expressed as total (microM + mM Ca-dependent) calpain activity. The distribution of the enzyme was regionally heterogeneous. Highest activity was found in the spinal cord, followed by the amygdala, and levels in mesencephalic areas and in cerebellar grey matter were also high. Levels in cerebellar white matter, tegmentum, pons, and putamen were low, and activity in cortical areas was also relatively low. Although in some areas activity seemed higher with aging, the differences were not statistically significant. We previously found that the regional distribution of cathepsin D in human and in rat brain is similar, this seems to be true for calpain activity as well. The increase of protease activ…
16887751	Age-related differences in the lifestyle regularity of seniors experiencing bereavement, care-giving, insomnia, and advancement into old-old age.	lifespan	2006-??-??	Compared to younger adults, seniors (> or = 60 yrs) often adopt a highly regular lifestyle, perhaps as an adaptive response to age-related changes in their sleep and circadian rhythms. At baseline, diary measures of lifestyle regularity (SRM-5) were obtained from 104 seniors of three separate groups. Thirty-three subjects were challenged by spousal bereavement or the need to care for a spouse at home with dementia (Challenged); 33 were suffering from formally diagnosed (DSM-IV) insomnia (Insomnia); and 38 were healthy, well-functioning older seniors in the second half of their eighth decade of life or later (Healthy Older). The objective of this study was to determine whether lifestyle regularity increased as a function of age within each of these three senior groups. Overall, age was significantly correlated with SRM-5 (r=0.41, p<0.001), with the SRM score increasing by 0.67 units/decade. The same was true for the Challenged and Insomnia groups, which also showed a significant correla…
15569360	The G/C915 polymorphism of transforming growth factor beta1 is associated with human longevity: a study in Italian centenarians.	longevity, aging	2004-12-??	Sequence variations in a variety of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine genes have been found to influence successful aging and longevity. Because of the role played by the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) cytokine in inflammation and regulation of immune responses, the variability of the TGF-beta1 gene may affect longevity by playing a role in inflamm-aging. Two polymorphisms, G/A -800 and C/T -509, located in the 5' region, and two missense polymorphisms, T/C 869 and G/C 915 which change (Leu > Pro)10 and (Arg > Pro)25, respectively, located in the signal peptide, were analysed in 419 subjects from Northern and Central Italy, including 172 centenarians and 247 younger controls. In addition, the effects of the TGF-beta1 genetic variability on plasma levels of the biologically active form (naturally processed) of this cytokine were studied in 143 randomly selected subjects, including 73 centenarians. Significant differences were found at the +915 site as far as the C allele …
12139953	Explaining neurocognitive aging: is one factor enough?	aging	2002-08-??	As an introduction to the special issue on neurocognitive factors underlying age effects, we discuss a number of recent developments in the literature on aging. The classic distinction between generalized and process-specific cognitive changes with old age has reappeared in the distinctions between the frontal lobe hypothesis and more differentiated views of neurocognitive aging. We argue that neurological decay in the frontal cortex has important implications for cognitive control, but that the frontal lobe hypothesis does not capture the plethora of changes that characterize aging and incorrectly suggests a unitary effect.
19548685	The effect of bacterial strain and aging on the secondary volatile metabolites produced during malolactic fermentation of tannat red wine.	aging	2009-07-22	During malolactic fermentation (MLF), lactic acid bacteria influence aroma and flavor of wines by the production of volatile metabolites and the modification of aroma compounds derived from grapes and yeasts. In an effort to isolate these bacteria properties as advantages for winemaking, this study aimed to assess the relative contribution of two aspects: the effects of lactic acid bacteria activity on the volatiles compounds in Tannat wines and the consequences of aging in bottle on aroma compounds produced during MLF. To our knowledge, this is the first report related to the effect of wine aging in bottle on the aroma chemical compounds produced by MLF. Solid phase extraction complemented with chromatographic techniques was used to study the wine aroma compounds. A sensory evaluation of the wines was also performed through descriptive methods. We demonstrated modifications in the concentration of acetates, ethyl esters, and other secondary metabolites during MLF. Major sensorial diff…
7968287	Water diffusion coefficient measurements in the finger by magnetic resonance imaging.	aging	1994-??-??	Diffusion coefficients of water have been measured in the fingers of humans by magnetic resonance imaging. It was found that the measured diffusion coefficients increased with subject age in certain regions of the finger but that these regions differed between males and females. The observation of an increased diffusion coefficient with age appears to be inconsistent with a direct-hydration model and possible explanations are given using other models. It is conjectured that the measured diffusion coefficient of water increases with age as a result of structural changes to proteins.
20188316	The quantity of meal fat influences the profile of postprandial hormones as well as hunger sensation in healthy elderly people.	aging	2010-03-??	BACKGROUND: In healthy elderly people, reduced appetite and the consequent decrease in food intake has been defined as the "anorexia of aging"; this condition may lead to malnutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate how different compositions of macronutrients affect satiety and hunger signals as well as subjective sensations after meals in healthy elderly subjects.    METHODS: Experimental controlled study. Ambulatory healthy community-dwelling subjects evaluation in a single center on 12 elderly subjects, (75.2+/-2 years old) and 12 younger controls (28.2+/-2 years old). Using a visual analogical scale, hunger was evaluated under fasting conditions and at 30-minute intervals for up to 4 hours after two 800-kcal meals, where 20% and 40% of the calories were derived from fat. Serum samples were collected at -30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes to determine the concentrations of GLP-1, acylated and desacylated ghrelin, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin.    RESULTS: Serum concentrat…
18448802	The other side of the Maillard reaction.	aging	2008-04-??	The Maillard reaction plays an important role in eye lens aging and cataract formation. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a metabolic dicarbonyl compound present in the lens. It reacts with arginine residues in lens proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs), such as hydroimidazolones and argpyrimidine. alpha-Crystallin, comprising alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin, is a major protein of the lens and it functions as a chaperone protein. We have found that upon reaction with MGO, human alphaA-crystallin becomes a more effective chaperone. Modification of specific arginine residues to AGEs appears to be the reason. Mutation of these arginine residues to alanine mirrors the effect of MGO, suggesting neutralization of the positive charge on arginine residues as a cause for improved chaperone function. Reaction with MGO also blocks the loss of the chaperone function of alphaA-crystallin caused by nonenzymatic glycation by ascorbate and ribose. These findings suggest that low levels of MGO mig…
23755918	An age-related numerical and functional deficit in CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) B cells is associated with an increase in systemic autoimmunity.	aging	2013-10-??	Autoimmunity increases with aging indicative of reduced immune tolerance, but the mechanisms involved are poorly defined. In recent years, subsets of B cells with immunoregulatory properties have been identified in murine models of autoimmune disorders, and these cells downregulate immune responses via secretion of IL10. In humans, immature transitional B cells with a CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) phenotype have been reported to regulate immune responses via IL10 production. We found the frequency and numbers of CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) cells were reduced in the PBMC pool with age. IL10 expression and secretion following activation via either CD40, or Toll-like receptors was also impaired in CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) B cells from healthy older donors. When investigating the mechanisms involved, we found that CD19(+) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) B-cell function was compromised by age-related effects on both T cells and B cells: specifically, CD40 ligand expression was lower in CD4 T cells from older …
22730253	Resveratrol still has something to say about aging!	aging	2012-07-09	A votre Santé! The mechanism by which resveratrol, a hydroxystilbenoid polyphenol found in grapes and present in wine, exerts antiaging metabolic benefits has been uncovered. Chung and co-workers have found that it works by inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterases, thus triggering a signaling cascade that leads to the possible activation of the mammalian enzyme sirtuin 1.

No significant influence of age on the stimulated salivary flow rate or pH was observed in a cross-sectional study of unmedicated adults. The females had a lower output than did the males in every age group. A tendency toward higher salivary counts of lactobacilli and yeasts with aging was observed.
12045892	The spatial distribution of macular pigment in humans.	aging	2001-12-??	PURPOSE: To estimate the distributions in width as well as in density of macular pigment (MP) in humans at different ages, imaging fundus reflectometry was employed as a tool to reach our aim.    METHODS: Imaging fundus reflectometry was used to measure the macular pigment distribution in human eyes with a modified fundus camera to which a cooled CCD camera was attached. The fundus images were taken at 460 nm and 560 nm after the retina was light-adapted to completely bleach rhodopsin. The density of macular pigment was estimated using a model described in the text. The variation in density with retinal eccentricity was fit to Gaussian distribution. The width of MP in retinal eccentricity was estimated by 95% covering area of the distribution profile. A total of 54 normal people served as subjects. They were divided into three groups with ages of 24.8 +/- 2.6 years (N = 24), 40.2 +/- 8.3 years (N = 13) and 67.5 +/- 7.1 years (N = 17) respectively. Statistical t-tests were employed to e…
17620930	Altered mechanisms of vasodilation in aged human skin.	aging	2007-07-??	Human skin blood flow increases in response to increased body core and local skin temperature via distinct reflex and local mechanisms requiring functional nitric oxide (NO) for full expression. The mechanisms mediating cutaneous vasodilation are impaired with primary aging, resulting in attenuated vasodilation. This article highlights recent findings of how age-related vascular impairments in NO signaling contribute to attenuated cutaneous vasodilation.
21487818	Multifractal analysis of nonlinear complexity of sacral skin blood flow oscillations in older adults.	aging	2011-08-??	The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between cutaneous vasodilatory function and nonlinear complexity of blood flow oscillations (BFO) in older people. A non-painful fast local heating protocol was applied to the sacral skin in 20 older subjects with various vasodilatory functions. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood oscillations. The complexity of the characteristic frequencies (i.e., metabolic (0.0095-0.02 Hz), neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz), myogenic (0.05-0.15 Hz), respiratory (0.15-0.4 Hz), and cardiac (0.4-2 Hz)) of BFO was quantified using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Compared with the 65-75 years group, the complexity of metabolic BFO in the 75-85 years group was significantly lower at the baseline (P < 0.05) and the second peak (P < 0.001). Compared with baseline BFO, subjects in the 65-75 years group had a significant increase in the complexity of metabolic BFO (P < 0.01) in response to local heating; while subjects…
8224037	The effect of age on insulin response and glucose utilization during four hyperglycemic plateaus.	aging	????-??-??	In order to evaluate the potential role of insulin insensitivity as a cause of the glucose (G) intolerance of aging, we performed 230 hyperglycemic clamps, 85 on young (Y, 24 to 39 years), 47 on middle age (M, 40 to 59 years), and 98 on old (O, 60 to 90 years) carefully screened subjects of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The 2-h plasma G levels on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were < 7.8 mmol/l in Y and M and < 10 mmol/l in old; the latter group was further dichotomized at 7.8 mmol/l into a "normal" group, ON, and an impaired group, OI. Four hyperglycemic plateaus were created: 3.0, 5.4, 7.9, and 12.8 mmol/l above basal. Three measures of glucose tolerance--1) G at 2 h after glucose ingestion, 2) glucose utilization, M, at each hyperglycemic plateau, and 3) glucose decay constant, K, obtained at the conclusion of each clamp--showed the best performance in the young group (Y > M = ON > OI). Despite these differences in glucose tolerance, plasma insulin responses (I) …
24655124	Association between physical performance and sense of autonomy in outdoor activities and life-space mobility in community-dwelling older people.	aging	2014-04-??	OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between physical performance and sense of autonomy in outdoor activities with life-space mobility-the spatial area a person purposefully moves through in daily life-in community-dwelling older people.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data of the Life-Space Mobility in Old Age cohort study.    SETTING: Structured interviews in participants' homes.    PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling people aged 75 to 90 (N = 848).    MEASUREMENTS: Sense of autonomy outdoors (Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire subscale), life-space mobility (Life-Space Assessment; University of Alabama, Birmingham Study of Aging), and Short Physical Performance Battery.    RESULTS: The median score for life-space mobility was 64.0. In linear regression models, poorer physical performance and more-limited sense of autonomy were independently associated with more restrictions in life-space mobility, explaining approximately one-third of the variation in l…
16857855	Extrahippocampal contributions to age differences in human spatial navigation.	aging	2007-06-??	The hippocampus (HC) and associated neural structures are hypothesized to contribute to individual differences in human spatial navigation. However, functional imaging studies and theoretical models underscore the importance of extrahippocampal regions as well. The purpose of the present study was to examine age differences in virtual environment navigation and to assess possible relationships between navigation and structural integrity of hippocampal and extrahippocampal brain regions. Healthy adult volunteers completed a virtual navigation task and underwent magnetic resonance imaging to assess volumes of the caudate nucleus (CN), cerebellum, HC, prefrontal, and primary visual cortices. Results demonstrated robust age-related differences in place learning. Moreover, individual differences in regional brain volumes as well as performance on the tests of memory and executive functions contributed to age differences in human place learning. High performance in a virtual navigation task …
16799134	Paraoxonase activity and genotype predispose to successful aging.	longevity, aging	2006-06-??	The paraoxonase 1 codon 192 R allele has been previously reported to have a role in successful aging. The relationship between PON1 genotypes, enzymatic activity, and mass concentration was evaluated in a group of 229 participants from 22 to 104 years of age, focusing our attention on nonagenarian/centenarian participants. We found a genetic control for paraoxonase activity that is maintained throughout life, also in the nonagenarians/centenarians. This activity decreases significantly during aging and shows different mean values among R and M carriers, where R+ and M- carriers have the significant highest paraoxonase activity. Results from the multinomial regression logistic model show that paraoxonase activity as well as R+ and M- carriers contribute significantly to the explanation of the longevity phenotype. In conclusion, we show that genetic variability at the PON1 locus is related to paraoxonase activity throughout life, and suggest that both parameters affect survival at extrem…
24008589	Understanding variability in the BOLD signal and why it matters for aging.	aging	2014-06-??	Recent work in neuroscience supports the idea that variability in brain function is necessary for optimal brain responsivity to a changing environment. In this review, we discuss a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in younger and older adults to assess age-related differences in variability of the fMRI signal. This work shows that moment-to-moment brain signal variability represents an important "signal" within what is typically considered measurement-related "noise" in fMRI. This accumulation of evidence suggests that moving beyond the mean will provide a complementary window into aging-related neural processes.
24373997	Maintenance of a healthy trajectory of the intestinal microbiome during aging: a dietary approach.	longevity, aging	????-??-??	Sharing an intense transgenomic metabolism with the host, the intestinal microbiota is an essential factor for several aspects of the human physiology. However, several age-related factors, such as changes diet, lifestyle, inflammation and frailty, force the deterioration of this intestinal microbiota-host mutualistic interaction, compromising the possibility to reach longevity. In this scenario, the NU-AGE project involves the development of dietary interventions specifically tailored to the maintenance of a healthy trajectory of the intestinal microbiome, counteracting all processes connected to the pathophysiology of the human aging.
18341424	Zinc in elderly people: effects of zinc supplementation on psychological dimensions in dependence of IL-6 -174 polymorphism: a Zincage study.	aging	2008-04-??	Zinc is relevant for psychological dimensions, which are altered in zinc deficiency, as in aging. Since zinc deficiency and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation may be related to genotypes of IL-6 -174 polymorphism, the main goal was to examine psychological dimensions in relationship to plasma zinc and genetic background of IL-6 in healthy elderly subjects, recruited in Italy, Greece, and Poland, before and after zinc supplementation. On the basis of IL-6 -174 polymorphism, significant restoration occurs for PSS, especially in Greece and Poland, less for MMSE and GDS, after zinc supplementation, suggesting zinc is important in reducing stress in elderly people.
2681358	Effects of age on cutaneous circulatory response to direct heat on the forearm.	aging	1989-11-??	To investigate the effects of age on the response of skin blood flow in the forearm to direct heat, three groups of 20 male subjects each--young (20-39 yr); middle-aged (40-59 yr) and older (60-79 yr)--consented to have skin blood flow measured in the forearm by a TSI Model 403 laser Doppler flowmeter. This instrument detects changes in red blood cell velocity (LDV) in flow-active vessels and the volume of red blood cells flowing through these vessels (LDO). With the forearm in a 30 degrees C water bath there were no significant between-group differences in LDV or LDO. Elevating bath temperature to 35 degrees C elicited a significant increase in LDO in all three groups, but LDV did not significantly change. Increasing temperature to 40 degrees C elicited significant increases in both LDO and LDV with the former being of greater magnitude. At this temperature LDV values in both the middle-aged and older groups were significantly lower than those of the young subjects. Expressing the dat…
7677128	Relation of FEV1 and peripheral blood leukocyte count to total mortality. The Normative Aging Study.	aging	1995-09-01	Increased peripheral blood leukocyte count and decreased level of pulmonary function have both been implicated as causes of increased total mortality in population-based studies. The extent to which these factors are independent of cigarette smoking is controversial. The authors explored the relation of leukocyte count and the level of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to total mortality in the Normative Aging Study population in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. Other covariates examined included forced vital capacity, height, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. The sample for the current analysis consisted of 1,956 men who underwent the baseline Normative Aging Study examination during 1961-1969. Subjects ranged in age from 21 to 80 years of age at the time of entry. A total of 170 deaths occurred over the 30 years of follow-up. Statistical analysis was conducted utilizing Cox proportional hazards modeling and regression trees for censored…
17317451	The Treviso Longeva (Trelong) study: a biomedical, demographic, economic and social investigation on people 70 years and over in a typical town of North-East of Italy.	longevity	2007-??-??	Longevity is a complex process resulting from genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interaction. These factors are poorly understood, and the comparison among health status, socio-economics, demographic and other characteristics of the elderly people can help in understanding these complex interactions. Such an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to allow an appropriate evaluation of longevity. Here we report the methodology and the first results of a representative study performed in 2003-2004 on people of 70 years and over, living in a typical town of North-East of Italy. In the research we collected biomedical, demographic, socio-economic and quality of life (QoL) data.
18163816	Age effects on brain oxygenation during hypercapnia.	aging	????-??-??	Previous studies showed that the cerebrovasodilation response to hypercapnia is attenuated with aging. The purpose of this study was to determine if normal aging attenuates increases in brain oxygenation during hypercapnia. Prefrontal cortex oxyhemoglobin (OHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) concentrations were measured in 13 healthy subjects ages 26 to 59 years using a frequency domain tissue oximeter. Measurements were obtained under the following conditions: (1) subject awake breathing spontaneously, (2) during mask ventilation with 21% oxygen, (3) mask ventilation with 100% oxygen, (4) 100% oxygen in a rebreathing circuit to increase end-tidal CO(2). Under baseline conditions breathing room air, there was a negative correlation between baseline OHb and age (r=-0.60, P<0.05). Ventilation with 100% oxygen increased OHb without a change in total hemoglobin and no affect of age. During mask rebreathing, end-tidal CO(2) increased from 39.5+/-5.0 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) to 56.5+/-5.7 m…
9732050	DNA repair and transcription in human premature aging disorders.	aging	1998-08-??	The human progeroid disorders Cockayne syndrome and Werner syndrome present with several clinical features that are associated with normal aging. These include distinct changes in the skin. The genes responsible for these conditions have recently been cloned and characterized. They both contain a characteristic helicase sequence, and helicase activity has been demonstrated using the purified Werner protein. Helicases are involved in a number of DNA metabolic transactions, including transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Cockayne cells are deficient in a special type of DNA repair, transcription coupled DNA repair, but they also appear to be defective in basal transcription. The diverse functions of the Cockayne protein are under intense study. Werner cells may have subtle defects in DNA repair, and possibly also in transcription. The biochemical clarification of the precise role of these gene products is likely to provide very significant clues into the mechanism of aging.
7852288	Simultaneous stereoinversion and isomerization at specific aspartic acid residues in alpha A-crystallin from human lens.	aging	1994-09-??	We characterized the primary structure of alpha A-crystallin from the lens of the human eye by detailed analyses of the amino acid sequence, mass, and stereoisomers, and found the biologically uncommon D- and beta-aspartic acid (Asp) residues in the protein. The stereoconfiguration of the Asp151 and Asp58 residues in alpha A-crystallin from old subjects (mean age: 80 years) was inverted to the D-isomer, and the residues were simultaneously isomerized to beta-aspartyl residues, which may occur via a succinimide intermediate. This is thought to be the first observation of stereoinversion of amino acids in protein in vivo. It is noteworthy that similar stereoinversion was observed in the same residues of alpha A-crystallin from young subjects (age: 11 months), with simultaneous isomerization, although the extent of isomerization was low compared with that in the aged. The conversion may take place in the early life of the lens and the resulting isomers may accumulate with aging. We also f…
22995907	Degradation of an old human protein: age-dependent cleavage of γS-crystallin generates a peptide that binds to cell membranes.	aging	2012-11-09	Long-lived proteins exist in a number of tissues in the human body; however, little is known about the reactions involved in their degradation over time. Lens proteins, which do not turn over, provide a useful system to examine such processes. Using a combination of Western blotting and proteomic methodology, age-related changes to a major protein, γS-crystallin, were studied. By teenage years, insoluble intact γS-crystallin was detected, indicative of protein denaturation. This was not the only change, however, because blots revealed evidence of significant cross-linking as well as cleavage of γS-crystallin in all adult lenses. Cleavage at a serine residue near the C terminus was a major reaction that caused the release of a 12-residue peptide, SPAVQSFRRIVE, which bound tightly to lens cell membranes. Several other crystallin-derived peptides with double basic residues also lodged in the cell membrane fraction. Model studies showed that once cleaved from γS-crystallin, SPAVQSFRRIVE ad…
18426957	They really are that old: a validation study of centenarian prevalence in Okinawa.	aging	2008-04-??	Long-lived individuals, such as centenarians, may harbor genetic or environmental advantages important for healthy aging. Populations with high prevalence of such individuals offer fertile ground for such research. However, precise phenotypes are required, particularly accurate age. Okinawa has among the world's highest reported prevalence of centenarians but, despite extensive study, no systematic validation of centenarian prevalence has been published. Therefore, we performed comprehensive age validation of a subset (8%) of the total centenarian population and assessed the reliability of the age registration system. Self-reported age was validated with several common methods and found to correlate well with documented age. Demographic methods, including assessment of age heaping, maximum age at death, centenarian proportions, and male to female ratios of centenarians indicate that the age registration system is reliable. We conclude that the high reported centenarian prevalence in Ok…
6480814	Leydig cell function in normal men: effect of age, life-style, residence, diet, and activity.	aging	1984-11-??	The decrease of plasma testosterone (T) in old age may be inherent to the aging process or secondary to environmental factors such as stress, minor illness, physical inactivity, etc. We determined plasma T, apparent free T, and gonadotropin levels in healthy men (n = 71), aged 26-90 yr living under identical conditions, i.e. as monks in a monastery. We found a highly significant age-dependent decrease in morning and mean 24-h T and apparent free T levels and a moderate increase in gonadotropin levels; the nycthemeral variation in plasma levels was, however, decreased in the elderly. In a larger group of healthy normal men (n = 302), smokers had higher T levels than nonsmokers in all age groups; values were similar whether older men lived in a geriatric institution or in their home. Diet had no discernable effect on T levels, whereas in young men plasma T levels decreased more in response to stress such as hypoglycemia or myocardial infarction than in elderly subjects. Moderate physical…
6294916	Effect of aging on lipid and carnitine metabolism.	aging	1982-10-??	In healthy subjects aged 20 to 50 years, the urinary excretion of carnitine and its serum concentration increased rapidly and markedly after synthetic beta 1-24 ACTH-Z was injected. Their serum triglyceride levels changed inversely. In contrast, healthy subjects older than 70 and patients aged 45 to 50 with atherosclerosis exhibited lower and delayed changes of carnitine excretion and serum concentrations of carnitine and lipid after ACTH injection. When the aged subjects and the atherosclerotic patients were administered with triiodothyronine prior to ACTH, their metabolic responses to ACTH improved towards normal. The results suggest that the aging process impairs the homeostatic regulation of serum lipid through a "lipid-carnitine" system and that thyroid hormone plays a contributory role in the activation of this system.
23222705	Aging and muscle: a neuron's perspective.	aging	2013-01-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Age-related muscle weakness causes a staggering economic, public, and personal burden. Most research has focused on internal muscular mechanisms as the root cause to strength loss. Here, we briefly discuss age-related impairments in the brain and peripheral nerve structures that may theoretically lead to muscle weakness in old age.    RECENT FINDINGS: Neuronal atrophy in the brain is accompanied by electrical noise tied to declines in dopaminergic neurotransmission that degrades communication between neurons. Additionally, sensorimotor feedback loops that help regulate corticospinal excitability are impaired. In the periphery, there is evidence for motor unit loss, axonal atrophy, demyelination caused by oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, and modified transmission of the electrical signal through the neuromuscular junction.    SUMMARY: Recent evidence clearly indicates that muscle weakness associated with aging is not entirely explained by classically postulate…

10860800	Extrastriatal mean regional uptake of fluorine-18-FDOPA in the normal aged brain--an approach using MRI-aided spatial normalization.	aging	2000-06-??	The aim of this study was to define the mean regional 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-dopa (FDOPA) uptake rate constant (K(i)) values in the striatal and extrastriatal regions of the brain of normal subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-aided spatial normalization of the FDOPA K(i) image and using automatic region of interest (ROI) analysis. Dynamic three-dimensional FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET) and three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired in 13 aged normal subjects. The FDOPA add image and the K(i) image of each subject were transformed into standard stereotactic space with the aid of individual coregistered MR image. The mean regional K(i) values of the striatal and extrastriatal regions before normalization were compared with the respective values after normalization. Then automatic ROI analysis was performed on the MRI-aided spatially normalized K(i) images of the 13 normal subjects. The K(i) values on original images and those on spatially normalized …
19245676	Normal human aging and early-stage schizophrenia share common molecular profiles.	aging	2009-06-??	We examined genome-wide expression datasets from human prefrontal cortex of normal and schizophrenic individuals ranging from 19 to 81 years of age. We found that changes in gene expression that are correlated with aging in normal subjects differ dramatically from those observed with aging in schizophrenic subjects. Only 2.5% of genes were correlated with age in both groups. Surprisingly, we also found a significant overlap (29-34%) between those genes whose expression was correlated with aging in normal subjects and those significantly altered in subjects with early-stage schizophrenia (within 4 years of diagnosis). This suggests that schizophrenia onset anticipates the normal aging process, and further, that some symptoms of aging, i.e. dementia and psychosis, might be explained by these common molecular profiles.
11382786	Differential influence of physical activity on lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density in the elderly population.	aging	2001-06-??	This study investigates the relationship between lifetime physical activity and bone mineral density (BMD) at various sites in 129 healthy men and women aged 72.1 +/- 6.5 years. BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and physical activity was assessed by using the QUANTAP system (Quantification de l'Activité Physique), a standardized and structured computer-assisted interview tool designed to assess lifetime physical activity. Linear regression models controlling for age, gender, height, body mass, lean mass, and smoking habits were performed. Higher levels of sporting activity during youth were associated with greater lumbar spine BMD ( p < .001). Similarly, femoral neck BMD was greatest in subjects who reported regularly taking part in sports over the previous 20 years ( p <. 05) and during their whole lifetime ( p < 0.05). Sporting activity at the time of bone mass development increases subsequent lumbar spine BMD, and more recent sporting activity contributes to the …
21273352	Age-related metabolic profiles in cognitively healthy elders: results from a voxel-based [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography study with partial volume effects correction.	aging	2011-03-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional brain variability has been scarcely investigated in cognitively healthy elderly subjects, and it is currently debated whether previous findings of regional metabolic variability are artifacts associated with brain atrophy. The primary purpose of this study was to test whether there is regional cerebral age-related hypometabolism specifically in later stages of life.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging and FDG-PET data were acquired from 55 cognitively healthy elderly subjects, and voxel-based linear correlations between age and GM volume or regional cerebral metabolism were conducted by using SPM5 in images with and without correction for PVE. To investigate sex-specific differences in the pattern of brain aging, we repeated the above voxelwise calculations after dividing our sample by sex.    RESULTS: Our analysis revealed 2 large clusters of age-related metabolic decrease in the overall sample, 1 in the left orbitofrontal cortex and the other in th…
11079492	Does cerebral blood flow decline in healthy aging? A PET study with partial-volume correction.	aging	2000-11-??	UNLABELLED: It remains a matter of controversy as to whether cerebral perfusion declines with healthy aging. In vivo imaging with PET permits quantitative evaluation of brain physiology; however, previous PET studies have inconsistently reported aging reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen metabolism, and glucose metabolism. In part, this may be because of a lack of correction for the dilution effect of age-related cerebral volume loss on PET measurements.    METHODS: CBF PET scans were obtained using [15O]H2O in 27 healthy individuals (age range, 19-76 y) and corrected for partial-volume effects from cerebral atrophy using an MR-based algorithm.    RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P = 0.01) in mean cortical CBF between young/midlife (age range, 19-46 y; mean +/- SD, 56+/-10 mL/100 mL/min) and elderly (age range, 60-76 y; mean +/- SD, 49+/-2.6 mL/100 mL/min) subgroups before correcting for partial-volume effects. However, this group difference resolved after partia…
12167345	Influenza A virus specific T cell immunity in humans during aging.	aging	2002-07-20	To study the decreasing responsiveness of the immune system during aging, influenza virus specific cellular immunity was investigated in a cohort of healthy blood donors between 18 and 70 years of age. The percentage of influenza A virus specific T cells was determined by flow cytometry and found not to change during aging. After stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, an increase in the percentage of IFN-gamma and IL-4 producing CD8(+) T cells was observed during aging. In addition, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was investigated in two additional groups of five donors, 18-20 and 68-70 years of age. The lytic capacity of purified CD8(+) T cells, after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with influenza A virus, seemed lower in 68- to 70-year-old donors than in 18- to 20-year-old donors. Therefore we conclude that the reduced CTL activity in the elderly is not the result of a lower frequency of virus-specific T cells, but more li…
27063083	Early-life stress and reproductive cost: A two-hit developmental model of accelerated aging?	longevity, aging	2016-05-??	Two seemingly independent bodies of research suggest a two-hit model of accelerated aging, one highlighting early-life stress and the other reproduction. The first, informed by developmental models of early-life stress, highlights reduced longevity effects of early adversity on telomere erosion, whereas the second, informed by evolutionary theories of aging, highlights such effects with regard to reproductive cost (in females). The fact that both early-life adversity and reproductive effort are associated with shorter telomeres and increased oxidative stress raises the prospect, consistent with life-history theory, that these two theoretical frameworks currently informing much research are tapping into the same evolutionary-developmental process of increased senescence and reduced longevity. Here we propose a mechanistic view of a two-hit model of accelerated aging in human females through (a) early-life adversity and (b) early reproduction, via a process of telomere erosion, while hig…
892449	Considerations on the role of aspartic acid racemization in the aging process.	aging	1977-??-??	Racemization of aspartyl residues in human dentine and enamel proteins has been shown to occur at a rate which corresponds to an enrichment in the D-aspartic acid content of 0.1% per year. This rate can be used to calculate the ages of living people or the in vivo lifetimes of slowly turned over proteins. We present stereochemical arguments for conformational changes in proteins as a consequence of racemized amino acid residues. In metabolically stable proteins, this phenomenon may play some part in the aging process. In renewed proteins, where certain factors may accelerate racemization, conformational changes induced by racemization could regulate protein degradation.
8475323	The detection of age-related decrease of dopamine D1, D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in living human brain.	aging	1993-05-??	1. Using positron emission tomography and 11C-N-methylspiperone and 11C- SCH23390, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in human brain were evaluated in living healthy age different subjects. 2. Dynamic analysis of PET data indicated that these receptor binding abilities decreased with aging in healthy humans.
23684478	Adult cognitive ability and socioeconomic status as mediators of the effects of childhood disadvantage on salivary cortisol in aging adults.	aging	2013-10-??	In this longitudinal study we investigate the influence of childhood disadvantage on midlife hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. Two mechanisms by which early life stress may affect later pathophysiology are through its influence on cognitive functioning or later socioeconomic (SES) disadvantage. We predicted that individual differences in young adult cognitive ability and midlife SES would mediate the influence of childhood disadvantage on midlife cortisol. On each of three nonconsecutive days, participants provided five salivary cortisol samples corresponding to their diurnal rhythm (N=727 men; mean age 55, SD=2.6). We calculated three measures of cortisol regulation (area-under-the curve cortisol reflecting total daytime cortisol output; cortisol-awakening-response; and wake-to-bed slope), averaging scores for each measure across multiple days. Childhood disadvantage combined four dichotomous indicators used previously by Rutter (1985): father low SES; mother educa…
1566834	Corticosteroid receptors and lymphocyte subsets in mononuclear leukocytes in aging.	aging	1992-04-??	Plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels and number of related receptors in mononuclear leukocytes were measured in 49 healthy aged subjects (62-97 yr) and in 21 adult controls (21-50 yr). In all subjects, in addition, lymphocyte subsets were determined as an index of corticosteroid action. The mean number of type I and type II receptors was significantly lower in aged subjects than in controls (respectively, 198 +/- 96 and 272 +/- 97 receptors/cell for type I, and 1,794 +/- 803 and 3,339 +/- 918 for type II receptors). Plasma aldosterone and cortisol and lymphocyte subsets were not different in the two groups. All of the parameters were also tested for correlation, and a significant inverse correlation was found between age and type I and type II receptors when all subjects were plotted and between aged and CD4 and age and CD4/CD8 in the aged group. These data show that aged subjects have reductions of corticosteroid receptors that are not associated with increase of related steroids an…
27989716	The influence of coping strategies and behavior on the physiological response to social stress in women: The role of age and menstrual cycle phase.	lifespan	2017-??-01	There is information indicating that the variations induced by the menstrual cycle may influence the capacity of young women to respond to stress. The physiological response to stress changes across the stages of the lifespan; however, in spite of the great increase in life expectancy, the way women react after menopause, a period characterized by a dramatic decline in sex hormones, has not been sufficiently studied. The main objective of the study was to examine the capacity to respond to and recover from an acute social stressor in post-menopausal women compared to young women. The second objective was to investigate the consequences of behavior on the self-regulatory systems. We measured behavior, cortisol, and heart rate during a speaking task in front of a committee in sixty-seven women: 36 post-menopausal and 31 pre-menopausal (follicular group n=14; luteal group n=17). No differences in heart rate reactivity between three groups were found. Post-menopausal women showed less cort…
16519820	Spectroscopic and biochemical correlations during the course of human lens aging.	aging	2006-03-06	BACKGROUND: With age, the human lens accumulates variety of substances that absorbs and fluorescence, which explains the color of yellow, brunescent and nigrescent cataract in terms of aging. The aim of this study was to assess lens fluorophores with properties comparable to those of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) in relation to age in human lenses. These fluorescent compounds are believed to be involved in the development of cataract.    METHODS: Spectroscopic (UV-Vis-NIR) and fluorescence photography (CCD-Digital based image analysis) studies were carried out in randomly selected intact human lenses (2-85 years). AGE-like fluorophores were also measured in water soluble and insoluble (alkali soluble) fractions of human lenses (20-80 years).    RESULTS: Our experimental findings suggest that there was a progressive shift in the absorbance characteristic of intact lens in the range of lambda210 nm-lambda470 nm. A relative increase in the absorptivity at lambda(511-520 nm), with …
22133517	Age-dependent and -independent associations between depression, anxiety, DHEAS, and cortisol: from the MIPH Industrial Cohort Studies (MICS).	lifespan, aging	2012-07-??	There is a well-established link between dysphoric mood and endocrine dysregulation, but the strength of this association may vary with age. In order to investigate this possibility we assessed anxiety and depression with overnight urinary cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) in 608 factory employees ranging between 21 and 62 years. As expected, DHEAS declined with age (r=-0.54, P<0.001) while there was a modest age-related increase in nocturnal cortisol (r=0.17, P<0.001). Depressive symptoms were associated with higher nocturnal cortisol (β=0.19, P<0.001), independent of age. While the association between anxiety and cortisol (age by anxiety interaction: β=0.11, P<0.05) became stronger with age, there was a similar decline in the DHEAS/cortisol ratio in high-anxious middle-aged adults (β=-0.10, P=0.018). The current findings suggest that dysphoric mood, and in particular anxiety, may exacerbate the effects of aging on cortisol release. Prospective studies are ne…
18317946	Premature senescence of human endothelial cells induced by inhibition of glutaminase.	aging	2008-08-??	Cellular senescence is now recognized as an important mechanism of tumor suppression, and the accumulation of senescent cells may contribute to the aging of various human tissues. Alterations of the cellular energy metabolism are considered key events in tumorigenesis and are also known to play an important role for aging processes in lower eukaryotic model systems. In this study, we addressed senescence-associated changes in the energy metabolism of human endothelial cells, using the HUVEC model of in vitro senescence. We observed a drastic reduction in cellular ATP levels in senescent endothelial cells. Although consumption of glucose and production of lactate significantly increased in senescent cells, no correlation was found between both metabolite conversion rates, neither in young endothelial cells nor in the senescent cells, which indicates that glycolysis is not the main energy source in HUVEC. On the other hand, glutamine consumption was increased in senescent HUVEC and inhib…
22066788	Association between the androgen levels and erectile function, cognitive functions and hypogonadism symptoms in aging males.	aging	2011-12-??	PURPOSE: Aging in men is characterized by a moderate decrease in plasma testosterone (T) levels. However, the association between partial androgen deficiency of the aging male and clinical symptoms and the ideal screening test are controversial. In this study, we investigated the association between the androgen levels and erectile function, cognitive functions and hypogonadism symptoms in aging males.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the association between total (TT), calculated free (FT) and bioavailable (BT) testosterone, and various clinical and laboratory parameters in 103 healthy males, 50-80 years old. Biochemical assessment was done after overnight fasting. Questionnaires were used to test for hypogonadism symptoms, erectile and cognitive functions.    RESULTS: TT levels were not correlated with aging in this study. However, FT and BT were found to decrease with age due to rising sex hormone binding globulin. TT levels were strongly correlated with FT and BT levels (r…
21179406	Minimal peroxide exposure of neuronal cells induces multifaceted adaptive responses.	aging	2010-12-17	Oxidative exposure of cells occurs naturally and may be associated with cellular damage and dysfunction. Protracted low level oxidative exposure can induce accumulated cell disruption, affecting multiple cellular functions. Accumulated oxidative exposure has also been proposed as one of the potential hallmarks of the physiological/pathophysiological aging process. We investigated the multifactorial effects of long-term minimal peroxide exposure upon SH-SY5Y neural cells to understand how they respond to the continued presence of oxidative stressors. We show that minimal protracted oxidative stresses induce complex molecular and physiological alterations in cell functionality. Upon chronic exposure to minimal doses of hydrogen peroxide, SH-SY5Y cells displayed a multifactorial response to the stressor. To fully appreciate the peroxide-mediated cellular effects, we assessed these adaptive effects at the genomic, proteomic and cellular signal processing level. Combined analyses of these m…
9734834	Age-related functional and structural changes in human dermo-epidermal junction components.	aging	1998-08-??	Cultured normal human keratinocytes obtained from 14 facial skin biopsies of donors aged 9-79 y were used to study the influence of donor age on the integrin receptors, cell adhesive properties in vitro, and type VII collagen synthesis. Immuno-spectrofluorimetric quantitation of integrins showed a decrease in the beta1- and beta4-subunits in low (0.08 mM) and high (1.8 mM) calcium conditions with aging. Calcium ions decreased the fluorescence intensity by relocating integrins at cell boundaries. Measurements of adhering cells showed that adhesion to bovine serum albumin-, type IV collagen- or laminin 1-coated plastic surfaces initially increased until donor age reached 30 y and then decreased. Specific adhesion to type IV collagen and laminin 1 did not vary with age, but the increase in adhesion to type IV collagen produced by manganese ions increased with age, suggesting an age-dependent feature of beta1 integrin. Synthesis of type VII collagen, increased or not by TGFbeta1 (10 ng per…
26955787	Development and aging of superficial white matter myelin from young adulthood to old age: Mapping by vertex-based surface statistics (VBSS).	aging	2016-05-??	Superficial white matter (SWM) lies immediately beneath cortical gray matter and consists primarily of short association fibers. The characteristics of SWM and its development and aging were seldom examined in the literature and warrant further investigation. Magnetization transfer imaging is sensitive to myelin changes in the white matter. Using an innovative multimodal imaging analysis approach, vertex-based surface statistics (VBSS), the current study vertexwise mapped age-related changes of magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in SWM from young adulthood to old age (30-85 years, N = 66). Results demonstrated regionally selective and temporally heterochronologic changes of SWM MTR with age, including (1) inverted U-shaped trajectories of SWM MTR in the rostral middle frontal, medial temporal, and temporoparietal regions, suggesting continuing myelination and protracted maturation till age 40-50 years and accelerating demyelination at age 60 and beyond, (2) linear decline of SWM MTR in…
15609104	Cloning of differentially expressed genes in skin fibroblasts from centenarians.	longevity, aging	2004-??-??	Normal human fibroblasts undergoing serial passaging have been extensively used to identify genes linked with aging. Most of the isolated genes relate to growth retardation signals and the failure of homeostasis that accompanies aging and senescence. In contrast, there is still limited knowledge regarding the nature of the genes that influence positively the rate of aging and longevity. Healthy centenarians represent the best example of successful aging and longevity. Studies using samples from these individuals have proved very valuable for identifying a variety of factors that contribute to successful aging. The aim of the current work was to take advantage of skin fibroblast cultures established from healthy donors including centenarians in order to clone differentially expressed genes in centenarians. First, we demonstrate that centenarian derived cultures follow the typical Hayflick curve and they enter senescence after serial passaging. Application of differential screening techn…
3817044	Urinary diluting capacity in elderly diabetic subjects.	aging	1986-??-??	Urinary concentrating ability declines with normal human aging but diluting capacity has been less well studied as a function of age. We studied free water clearance (CH2O) in a group of Type II diabetic patients, aged 47 to 70 years. Conventional water load testing in sulfonylurea-treated diabetic patients revealed preservation of diluting capacity (ability to achieve Uosm less than 100 mOsm/kg) in subjects greater than 60 years of age. Tolazamide permitted expression of normal CH2O; chlorpropamide administration predictably reduced CH2O relative to tolazamide by 58% in subjects greater than 60 years. Free water clearance (CH2O) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were comparable in elderly subjects (greater than 60 years) and those less than or equal to 60 years. Normal CH2O in these diabetic patients was explained by persistently normal GFR in the study group. Osmolar clearance (Cosm) was insignificantly lower in diabetics greater than 60 years. Thus, a fall in CH2O in elderly diab…
26923400	State- and trait-dependent associations of vitamin-D with brain function during aging.	aging	2016-03-??	We investigated whether (1) serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the group-specific component (GC) gene-regulating serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with cognition in older individuals; and (2) whether causal relationships exist between 25(OH)D and cognition during aging. Data from 1207 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were analyzed (mean follow-up, 10.4 years) to test associations between serum 25(OH)D and cognition. Two GC SNPs were used to derive a composite genetic risk score associated with lower 25(OH)D concentrations. Lower serum 25(OH)D and higher GC composite scores were associated with lower executive function at baseline. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal relationship between lower serum 25(OH)D and poorer executive function and psychomotor speed. The SNP score was also associated with lower performance on measures of visuospatial abilities at baseline but with attenuated decl…
15750694	Effect of age on body sway assessed by computerized posturography.	aging	2005-??-??	The swaying and postural instability frequently seen in elderly subjects had not been analyzed quantitatively in detail until the introduction of computerized posturography. In order to assess the changes of body sway with aging, we performed computerized posturography in 144 subjects (51 men and 93 women, between the ages of 22 and 88 years) without specific neurological or metabolic disorders. The total and timed track length of the center of gravity, reflecting the distance of sway, increased with advancing age, with a highly significant positive correlation, without marked sex differences. The total area covered by the track of the center of gravity (expressing the extent of sway) also showed a similar tendency. Track density per unit area, expressing the efficiency of postural control, in contrast, decreased with age, showing a significant negative correlation with age, but only when the subjects had their eyes open; this decrease did not occur when they had their eyes closed. The…
6642213	Exocrine pancreatic function in the elderly.	aging	1983-??-??	We studied pancreatic bicarbonate and enzyme output in response to a continuous intravenous infusion of secretin, 1 CU/kg X h, and cerulein, 100 ng/kg X h, in 25 elderly subjects and in 30 young controls. Almost all elderly persons had pancreatic outputs within the range of controls. Only 3 aged individuals showed diminished enzyme output, but the reduction was very slight. We conclude that exocrine pancreatic function is not significantly influenced by aging.
21976718	Higher testosterone levels are associated with less loss of lean body mass in older men.	aging	2011-12-??	CONTEXT: Little information exists about longitudinal changes in body composition and physical function in relation to sex hormone levels in older men.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine associations of testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG with changes in body composition and physical function.    DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a prospective cohort study within the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study at six U.S. clinical centers.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5994 ambulatory men aged 65 yr or older enrolled in the MrOS. We examined 1183 men with complete measures of sex steroid hormones, body composition, and some measure of physical function.    INTERVENTION: There were no interventions.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sex steroids were measured by mass spectrometry in serum collected at baseline. Measurements of body composition using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and physical performance (grip strength, leg power, timed chair stands, narrow walk, and 6-m walk) we…
22442028	Cyclooxygenase inhibition abolishes age-related differences in cerebral vasodilator responses to hypercapnia.	aging	2012-06-??	Blood flow and vasodilatory responses are altered by age in a number of vascular beds, including the cerebral circulation. To test the role of prostaglandins as regulators of cerebral vascular function, we examined cerebral vasodilator responses to CO(2) (cerebrovascular reactivity) in young (26 ± 5 yr; 6 males/6 females) and older (65 ± 6 yr, 5 males/5 females) healthy humans before and after cyclooxygenase inhibition (using indomethacin). Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) responses to stepped hypercapnia were measured before and 90 min after indomethacin. Changes in MCAv during the recovery from hypercapnia (vasoconstrictor responses) were also evaluated before and after indomethacin. Cerebrovascular reactivity was calculated using linear regression between MCAv and end-tidal CO(2). Young adults demonstrated greater MCAv (55 ± 6 vs. 39 ± 5 cm/s: P < 0.05) and MCAv reactivity (1.67 ± 0.20 vs. 1.09 ± 0.19 cm·s(-1)·mmHg(-1); P < 0.05) to hypercapnia compared with older adults (P < …
9042925	The age dependency of gene expression for plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins.	lifespan	1997-03-??	The aim of this study was to investigate and disentangle the genetic and nongenetic causes of stability and change in lipids and (apo)lipoproteins that occur during the lifespan. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) were measured in a group of 160 middle-aged parents and their twin offspring (first project) and in a group of 203 middle-aged twin pairs (second project). Combining the data of both projects enabled the estimation of the extent to which measured lipid parameters are influenced by different genes in adolescence and adulthood. To that end, an extended quantitative genetic model was specified, which allowed the estimation of heritabilities for each sex and generation separately. Heritabilities were similar for both sexes and both generations. Larger variances in the parental generation could be ascribed to proportional increases in both un…
23142518	Age related differences in maximal and rapid torque characteristics of the leg extensors and flexors in young, middle-aged and old men.	aging	2013-02-??	The decline in maximal and rapid isometric torque characteristics may compromise functional living abilities in aging adults while loco-motor muscle groups, such as the leg extensors and flexors, may exhibit different torque-time age related decreases. The purpose of the present study was to examine the age-related differences in maximal and rapid torque characteristics of the leg extensor and flexor muscle groups in young, middle-aged, and old men. Sixty-five healthy men were categorized by age as young (n=25; mean±SD age=24.9±3.0 years), middle-aged (n=22; age=50.6±4.0 years), and old (n=18; age=66.8±4.5 years). Participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the leg extensors and flexors and an estimated thigh cross sectional area (eThighCSA) assessment. Peak torque (PT), peak rate of torque development (RTDpeak), absolute RTD and the contractile impulse (IMPULSE) were calculated at time intervals of 30, 50, 100 and 200 ms from the torque-time curve. Relative RTD was…
21430150	The importance of being variable.	aging	2011-03-23	New work suggests that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability can be a much more powerful index of human age than mean activation, and that older brains are actually less variable than younger brains. However, little is known of how BOLD variability and task performance may relate. In the current study, we examined BOLD variability in relation to age, and reaction time speed and consistency in healthy younger (20-30 years) and older (56-85 years) adults on three cognitive tasks (perceptual matching, attentional cueing, and delayed match-to-sample). Results indicated that younger, faster, and more consistent performers exhibited significantly higher brain variability across tasks, and showed greater variability-based regional differentiation compared with older, poorer-performing adults. Also, when we compared brain variability- and typical mean-based effects, the respective spatial patterns were essentially orthogonal across brain measures, and any regions that did over…
20047503	HIV infection and aging independently affect brain function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.	aging	2010-02-01	We investigated the interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and aging and their effects on brain function demands by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A multiple-regression model was used to study the association and interaction between fMRI measures, HIV serostatus, and age for 26 HIV-infected subjects and 25 seronegative subjects. Although HIV serostatus and age independently affected fMRI measures, no interaction occurred. Functional brain demands in HIV-positive subjects were equivalent to those of HIV-negative subjects who were 15-20 years older. Frailty parallels between HIV infection and aging could result from continued immunological challenges depleting resources and triggering increased metabolic demands. In the future, fMRI could be a noninvasive biomarker to assess HIV infection in the brain.
22102004	Cellular aging and senescence characteristics of human T-lymphocytes.	aging	2012-04-??	CD28-, CD57+ and KLRG1+ are cell surface markers that have been used to describe senescent T-lymphocytes in humans. However, the relationship among these phenotypes during aging, and their relationship with the concept of in vitro cellular aging have not been well established. Using five-colour flow cytometry, we analyzed peripheral blood T-lymphocytes for their expression of CD28, CD57 and KLRG1 in 11 young (Y) and 11 old (O) apparently healthy human subjects. The proportions of CD28- and CD57+ cells were significantly higher among the T-cell populations of O compared to Y subjects; the proportion of KLRG1+ cells was significantly higher only among CD8+ cells. Populations that were more frequent in the elderly participants were characterised as CD28+ CD57+, CD28- CD57+ or CD28- CD57-. The expression of p16 and p21, considered as markers for in vitro senescence, was higher in CD28+ CD57+ cells than in other subpopulations in both age groups. The expression of p21 was age-related, which…
8675133	Identification of osteocalcin as a permanent aging constituent of the bone matrix: basis for an accurate age at death determination.	aging	1996-01-12	Age at death determination based on aspartic acid racemization in dentin has been applied successfully in forensic odontology for several years now. An age-dependent accumulation of D-aspartic acid has also recently been demonstrated in bone osteocalcin, one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins of the organic bone matrix. Evaluation of these initial data on in vivo racemization of aspartic acid in bone osteocalcin was taken a step further. After purification of osteocalcin from 53 skull bone specimens, the extent of aspartic acid racemization in this peptide was determined. The D-aspartic acid content of purified bone osteocalcin exhibited a very close relationship to age at death. This confirmed identification of bone osteocalcin as a permanent, 'aging' peptide of the organic bone matrix. Its D-aspartic acid content may be used as a measure of its age and hence that of the entire organism. The new biochemical approach to determination of age at death by analyzing bone is compl…
19457451	Molecular basis of the myogenic profile of aged human skeletal muscle satellite cells during differentiation.	aging	2009-08-??	Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength and function. Human muscle proteins are synthesized at a slower rate in the elderly than in young adults, leading to atrophy and muscle mass loss with a decline in the functional capability. Additionally, aging is accompanied by a decrease in the ability of muscle tissue to regenerate following injury or overuse due to the impairment of intervening satellite cells, in which we previously reported oxidative damage evidences. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of aging on myoblasts and myotubes obtained from human skeletal muscle, and characterize the transcriptional profile as molecular expression patterns in relation to age-dependent modifications in their regenerative capacity. Our data show that the failure to differentiate does not depend on reduced myogenic cell number, but difficulty to complete the differentiation program. Data reported here suggested the following findings: (i) oxidative damage ac…
21254797	Modulatory effects of levodopa on cognitive control in young but not in older subjects: a pharmacological fMRI study.	aging	2011-10-??	Older individuals show decline of prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions which may be related to altered dopaminergic neurotransmission. We investigated the effects of aging and dopaminergic stimulation in 15 young and 13 older healthy subjects on the neural correlates of interference control using fMRI. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design, subjects were measured after levodopa (100 mg) or placebo administration. In each session, subjects performed a visual-spatial interference task based on a Stroop/Simon-like paradigm. Across age groups, interference (incongruent relative to congruent trials) was associated with activations in the presupplementary motor area, ACC, and intraparietal cortex. Increased interference was found behaviorally in older volunteers. Differential activation in left dorsolateral PFC in young subjects and bilateral PFC activity in older subjects was observed to be associated with interference control. Performance deteriorated under levodopa only…
6476977	Antibody and immunoglobulin levels in aged humans.	aging	1984-07-??	IgM and IgG type antibody titers and levels of serum IgG, IgA and IgM were determined in healthy young and aged subjects. The proportion of subjects of low antibacterial agglutinin titers progressively increased during the 7th and 8th decades of life. Anti-streptolysin-O titers were also shifted to the lower values in aged subjects, at least until the 8th decade of life, although subnormal values compared to the young control range were less frequent than in the case of IgM type antibodies. Anti-streptokinase values did not seem affected by age. In contrast to antibody levels, serum IgM was similar or slightly higher in old compared to young subjects. Evidence is presented that the proportion of 7 S IgM drops with aging. Both IgA and IgG levels increased through the 7th, 8th and 9th decades of life. Different class immunoglobulin levels seemed to be considerably correlated and a tendency to correlate was found between IgG type antibody and serum IgG levels. Complex investigations inclu…
18580402	The association between flow-mediated dilation and physical function in older men.	aging	2008-07-??	UNLABELLED: The probability that an individual is able to live independently decreases sharply below the threshold score of 57 units on the physical functional performance (PFP-10) test.    PURPOSE: To examine the relation between brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BAFMD) on individual and total scores on the PFP-10. We hypothesized that lower scores on the PFP-10 test would be associated with lower BAFMD.    METHODS: Sixty-four men (age, 84 +/- 11 yr) from the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study were studied. Participants were classified by their performance on the PFP-10 test (Class I, score <26; Class II, score between 26 and 57; and Class III, score > 57). BAFMD was assessed after 5 min of forearm occlusion, using high-resolution ultrasonography.    RESULTS: The average total score on the PFP-10 test and BAFMD were 42.9 +/- 22 U and 2.76 +/- 2.13%, respectively. The BAFMD was associated with total PFP-10 score (r = 0.45, P = 0.0001) and age (r = -0.36, P = 0.003). BAFMD was signific…
23284706	The relationship between cerebral glucose metabolism and age: report of a large brain PET data set.	aging	2012-??-??	Cerebral glucose metabolism is a reliable index of neural activity and may provide evidence for brain function in healthy adults. We studied the correlation between cerebral glucose metabolism and age under the resting-state in both sexes with position emission tomography. Statistical test of age effect on cerebral glucose metabolism was performed using the statistical parametric mapping software with a voxel-by-voxel approach (p=0.05 family wise error corrected, 100-voxel threshold). The subjects consisted of 108 females (mean ± S.D. = 45 ± 10 years) and 126 males (mean ± S.D. = 49 ± 11 years). We showed here that brain activity in the frontal and temporal lobes in both sexes decreased significantly with normal aging. The glucose metabolism in the caudate bilaterally showed a negative correlation with age in males, but not in females. Few regions in males were shown with an increased glucose metabolism with age. Although the mechanisms of brain aging are still unknown, a map of brain …
8403894	Changes in the ratio of non-calcified collagen to calcified collagen in human vertebrae with advancing age.	aging	1993-??-??	Bone loss associated with aging is associated primarily with a decline in bone formation. To try and further understand the nature of this process we have used a biochemical approach which relies on the fact that osteoid is susceptible to enzymatic degradation whereas calcified collagen is protected by the mineral phase against proteolytic digestion. Our findings show a statistically significant inverse relationship between osteoid and age (r = 0.70 female, r = 0.47 male). A closer relationship was observed when age was related to the ratio of osteoid to bone (r = 0.73 female, r = 0.56 male). In both cases, the observed linear decline begins at an early age and becomes marked with advancing age. Histologic observations illustrate these findings showing decreased osteoid and osteoblasts in the older vertebral specimens compared to the younger ones. Even though the mechanism for osteoid calcification seems to remain unimpaired, the decline of a calcifiable matrix in the presence of norma…
22580060	The cortisol awakening response is related with PERIOD1 clock gene expression in older women.	aging	2012-07-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is a useful endocrine marker for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Recent studies suggest that the cortisol level influences the expression of the hPER1 clock gene which is involved in the generation of biological rhythms. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between CAR and hPER1 gene expression with respect to human aging.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Salivary cortisol levels were determined in 20 older women (mean age ± SD, 67.9 ± 5.12 yrs) and 30 young women (24.4 ± 2.13 yrs) at awakening (T0) and at 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 60 min after awakening (T15, T30, T45, T60) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. CAR was calculated as difference of the cortisol levels at T0 and T30. The expression of the hPER1 gene at 0800 h was determined from oral mucosa cells by relative quantification using h36B4 as house-keeping gene. Additional variables, which may affect the CAR, were assessed by questionnaire. Re…
2499589	Decreased basal and stimulated thyrotropin secretion in healthy elderly men.	aging	1989-07-??	To delineate the effects of aging on basal and stimulated TSH secretion, we studied the 24-h profile of plasma TSH levels and the TSH response to TRH stimulation (200 micrograms TRH, iv) in eight healthy elderly men, aged 67-84 yr, and eight normal young men, aged 20-27 yr. Subjects with thyroid antibodies against microsomal or thyroglobulin antigens were excluded. During the 24-h study, blood was sampled at 15-min intervals. TSH levels were measured by an ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay. Sleep was polygraphically monitored, and circadian and pulsatile TSH variations were quantified using specifically designed computer algorithms. In older men, the 24-h mean TSH concentration was approximately 50% lower than that in young men (0.78 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.41 microU/mL; P less than 0.01), but basal T3 levels were only slightly lower (93 +/- 12 vs. 115 +/- 16 ng/dL; P less than 0.02), while basal T4 levels were normal. The normal diurnal variation of TSH levels, with a nocturnal a…
3666063	Cleavage from the N-terminal region of beta Bp crystallin during aging of the human lens.	aging	1987-09-??	Polyclonal antisera have been made to synthetic peptides that correspond to the N-terminal (residues 1-12) and C-terminal (residues 195-204) sequences of bovine beta Bp crystallin. Both anti-beta Bp1-12 and anti-beta Bp195-204 recognize specifically the beta Bp component of bovine lens. In the young human lens, anti-beta Bp195-204 recognizes predominantly the 26,000 MW form of beta Bp, while in older lenses this same antiserum recognizes mainly the 22,000 MW in vivo proteolysis product. In contrast, during aging of the normal human lens anti-beta Bp1-12 recognizes only decreasing amounts of the 26,000 MW form of beta Bp, with no binding to the 22,000 MW form of this polypeptide. These results suggest that during aging of the normal human lens, the N-terminus of beta Bp is the preferred site of in vivo proteolysis.
21147083	Haptoglobin (HP) polymorphisms and human longevity: a cross-sectional association study in a Central Italy population.	longevity, aging	2011-03-18	BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (HP), which scavenges free, cell-toxic hemoglobin and has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory function in extravascular tissues, may represent an excellent candidate gene to investigate the life-span expectancy.    METHODS: HP 1/2 polymorphism has been determined for 1072 (569 females, 503 males) unrelated healthy individuals from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and accounting for the different survivals between sexes. HP*1F/S subtyping was also performed to check the possible existence for a preferential advantage of HP*1F or HP*1S allele.    RESULTS: HP*1/*1 genotype results associated to increased probability of young subjects of attaining longevity (Comparison 1: O.R. 1.709, p=0.0114) with a concomitant advantage of HP*1 allele (Comparison 1: O.R. 1.273, p=0.0194). On the other side, carriers of HP*2 allele displayed an overall significant disadvantage in reachin…
12766792	Homocysteine: a marker for cognitive performance? A longitudinal follow-up study.	aging	2003-??-??	The present prospective study investigated whether elevated total serum homocysteine concentration is a risk factor for cognitive decline. The outcomes were compared to the possible relation between cognition and vitamin B12 or folic acid. Cognitive performance of 144 normal aging individuals (aged 30-80 years) was tested at baseline and after six years of follow-up. Domains of cognitive function addressed were cognitive speed (Letter-Digit Coding test), attention and information processing (Stroop test) and verbal learning and memory (Word Learning Test Total; Delayed Recall). Serum concentrations of homocysteine, folic acid and vitamin B12 were determined. Serum concentrations of homocysteine correlated negatively with cognitive performance on the Word Learning tests at baseline, independent of age, sex, education level or folic acid concentration. Homocysteine concentration at baseline correlated negatively with cognitive performance on the Stroop and Word Learning tests during the …
7050220	Effect of age on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and in vivo insulin action.	aging	1982-09-??	The effect of age on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and in vivo insulin action (insulin clamp) was studied in 48 nonobese subjects, all of whom were fully ambulatory and in good general health. The observed age-related increase in fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.35, P less than 0.01) was not due to an increase in relative body weight (RBW). Plasma insulin levels, both fasting and postprandial, tended to rise with age, but these changes were not significant. There was a marginally significant correlation (r = -0.21) between age and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, which fell to -0.13 when controlled for RBW. However, steady-state insulin levels during the insulin-clamp period were higher in the older subjects, suggesting that age leads to an impairment in insulin catabolism; thus it is likely that the impairment of in vivo insulin action with age was underestimated. The variation in in vivo action between individuals was much greater among the older subjects. It was conclude…
7660243	Aging and degeneration of the human intervertebral disc.	aging	1995-06-01	Human intervertebral discs undergo age-related degenerative changes that contribute to some of the most common causes of impairment and disability for middle aged and older persons: spine stiffness, neck pain, and back pain. Potential causes of the age-related degeneration of intervertebral discs include declining nutrition, loss of viable cells, cell senescence, post-translational modification of matrix proteins, accumulation of degraded matrix molecules, and fatigue failure of the matrix. The most important of these mechanisms appears to be decreasing nutrition of the central disc that allows accumulation of cell waste products and degraded matrix molecules, impairs cell nutrition, and causes a fall in pH levels that further compromises cell function and may cause cell death. Although aging changes of the disc appear to be inevitable, identification of activities and agents that accelerate these changes may help decrease the rate and severity of disc degeneration; and recent work sug…
27760422	How We Experience Being Alone: Age Differences in Affective and Biological Correlates of Momentary Solitude.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Spending time alone constitutes a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives. As we get older, alone time increases. Less is known, however, about age differences in the experience of spending time alone (momentary solitude).    OBJECTIVES: We examined time-varying associations between momentary solitude, affect quality, and two hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity markers [salivary cortisol; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs)] to better understand the affective and biological correlates of momentary solitude across the adult life span.    METHOD: A total of 185 adults aged 20-81 years (mean age = 49 years, 51% female, 74% Caucasian) completed questionnaires on momentary solitude (alone vs. not alone) and current affect on a handheld device, and provided concurrent saliva samples up to seven times a day for 10 consecutive days. Data were analyzed using multilevel models, controlling for the overall amount of time participants spent alone during the study (overall sol…
12783983	Gene expression profile of aging in human muscle.	aging	2003-07-07	Studies of gene expression related to aging of skeletal muscle have included few subjects or a limited number of genes. We conducted the present study to produce more comprehensive gene expression profiles. RNA was extracted from vastus lateralis biopsies obtained from healthy young (21-27 yr old, n = 8) and older men (67-75 yr old, n = 8) and was analyzed with high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Of the approximately 44,000 probe sets on the arrays, approximately 18,000 yielded adequate signals for statistical analysis. There were approximately 700 probe sets for which t-tests or rank sum tests indicated a difference (P <or= 0.01) in mean expression between young and old and for which the estimated false discovery rate was <10%. Most of these differences were less than 1.5-fold in magnitude. Genes that encode proteins involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial protein synthesis were expressed at a lower level in older muscle. Genes encoding metallothioneins, high-mobility-group p…
8473691	Aging as a modulator of respiratory sinus arrhythmia.	aging	1993-03-??	Aging is associated with an accentuated shift toward sympathetic outflow. Evidence suggests that sympathetic and vagal-cardiac activity change reciprocally. If this hypothesis is correct, then aging would result in an attenuation of vagal-cardiac activity. The current cross-sectional investigation assessed the relationship between aging, vagal-cardiac activity, and arteriolar compliance (AC). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and finger plethysmography, noninvasive measures of vagal-cardiac activity and arteriolar compliance, respectively, were made on 70 normotensive male subjects (age range 15-81 years). Both RSA and AC decreased with age (r = .71 and .89, respectively, p < .001). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the six decade groups for RSA and AC (p < .05). These findings support the notion that there is an age-related loss of vagal-cardiac activity that could be partly explained by the loss of arteriolar compliance. These findings are consistent with…
25601353	Wavelength optimized cross-polarized wide-field imaging for noninvasive and rapid evaluation of dermal structures.	aging	2015-04-??	Changes in the morphology of dermal collagen may indicate aging or pathological processes. At present, there is no technology for in vivo real-time assessment of collagen structures. Our goal was to introduce and validate polarization optical imaging for noninvasive quantitative evaluation of dermal collagen. Seventeen volunteers participated in the study. Cross-polarized 440 nm images were acquired noninvasively from facial skin of the study subjects. Collagen content and intensity histogram were computed from the optical images. Quantitative results showed a decrease in the collagen content with increasing age of the subjects. Analysis of the collagen image histogram parameters demonstrated decreasing mean pixel value and increasing full width at half maximum (FWHM) with increasing age. Polarization optical imaging has the potential for rapid noninvasive in vivo evaluation of human dermis. Cross-polarized imaging at different wavelengths emphasizes different features of human skin. (…
22305529	DNA methylation signatures in development and aging of the human prefrontal cortex.	aging	2012-02-10	The human prefrontal cortex (PFC), a mastermind of the brain, is one of the last brain regions to mature. To investigate the role of epigenetics in the development of PFC, we examined DNA methylation in ∼14,500 genes at ∼27,000 CpG loci focused on 5' promoter regions in 108 subjects range in age from fetal to elderly. DNA methylation in the PFC shows unique temporal patterns across life. The fastest changes occur during the prenatal period, slow down markedly after birth and continue to slow further with aging. At the genome level, the transition from fetal to postnatal life is typified by a reversal of direction, from demethylation prenatally to increased methylation postnatally. DNA methylation is strongly associated with genotypic variants and correlates with expression of a subset of genes, including genes involved in brain development and in de novo DNA methylation. Our results indicate that promoter DNA methylation in the human PFC is a highly dynamic process modified by genetic …
23227981	Physical activity opposes the age-related increase in skeletal muscle and plasma endothelin-1 levels and normalizes plasma endothelin-1 levels in individuals with essential hypertension.	aging	2013-03-??	AIMS: Endothelin-1 has potent constrictor and proliferative activity in vascular smooth muscle, and essential hypertension and aging are associated with increased endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of physical activity, hypertension and age on endothelin-1 levels in plasma and skeletal muscle and endothelin receptors in skeletal muscle in human subjects.    METHODS: In study 1, normotensive (46 ± 1 years, n = 11) and hypertensive (47 ± 1 years, n = 10) subjects were studied before and after 8 weeks of aerobic exercise training. In study 2, young (23 ± 1 years, n = 8), older lifelong sedentary (66 ± 2 years, n = 8) and older lifelong endurance-trained (62 ± 2 years, n = 8) subjects were studied in a cross-sectional design.    RESULTS: Skeletal muscle and plasma endothelin-1 levels were increased with age and plasma endothelin-1 levels were higher in hypertensive than normotensive individuals. Eight weeks of exercise training n…
25022332	Zinc homeostasis and immunosenescence.	aging	2015-01-??	For more than 50 years, zinc is known to be an essential trace element, having a regulatory role in the immune system. Deficiency in zinc thus compromises proper immune function, like it is observed in the elderly population. Here mild zinc deficiency is a common condition, documented by a decline of serum or plasma zinc levels with age. This leads to a dysregulation mainly in the adaptive immunity that can result in an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as a status called inflamm-aging. T cell activation as well as polarization of T helper (Th) cells into their different subpopulations (Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells (Treg)) is highly influenced by zinc homeostasis. In the elderly a shift of the Th cell balance towards Th2 response is observed, a non-specific pre-activation of T cells is displayed, as well as a decreased response to vaccination is seen. Moreover, an impaired function of innate immune cells indicate a predominance of zinc deficiency in the el…
17251909	Parametric and regional maps of free serotonin 5HT1A receptor sites in human brain as function of age in healthy humans.	aging	2007-08-??	Serotonin 5HT(1A)-binding sites can be detected in living human brain with the positron-emitting antagonist [(11)C]WAY-100635. Previous measurements of the availability of [(11)C]WAY-binding sites in normal aging are equivocal, in part because of the greatly variable binding of this ligand. To test the null hypothesis that the binding potential (pB) of 5HT(1A) sites remains constant with age; 19 healthy volunteers aged 23-73 years (8 women, 11 men) underwent positron emission tomography. To determine pBs, we applied a novel tissue reference method of analysis, Estimation of Reversible Ligand Binding and Receptor Density (ERLiBIiRD) (Gjedde, 2003; Rosa-Neto et al, 2004), which extrapolates measures of specific binding to an estimated steady-state. We compared these estimates in the two age groups with results obtained with the conventional Logan Plot and Simplified Reference Tissue Method (SRTM) applied to both regions of interest-based as parametric analyses. The regional distribution …
12714249	Stable telomere length and telomerase expression from naïve to memory B-lymphocyte differentiation.	lifespan	2003-04-??	Telomere length and telomerase activity play important roles in regulating replicative lifespan of cells. The length of telomeres also serves as a marker for the replicative history and for the remaining replicative potential of cells. Differential telomere length has been reported in human naïve and memory T cells but not in naïve versus memory B-lymphocytes. We report here an analysis of telomere length and induced telomerase expression in naïve (CD27(-)) and memory (CD27(+)) B cells from normal adults. Although both naïve and memory B cells lose telomere repeats with age, there is no consistent difference in telomere length between these two B cell subsets. Furthermore, both naïve and memory B cells are capable of inducing telomerase activity at similar levels after in vitro stimulation independent of donor's age. Finally, there is a slow increase of memory B cells in peripheral blood with age. Together, these findings suggest that B cells are capable of maintaining telomere length …
15269946	Diffusion anisotropy in subcortical white matter and cortical gray matter: changes with aging and the role of CSF-suppression.	aging	2004-08-??	PURPOSE: To determine the relevance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-suppression for the measurement of diffusion anisotropy in well-localized areas of the brain, particularly the subcortical white matter (WM) within the gyri and cortical gray matter (GM), in young and elderly subjects, and to assess the changes of water diffusivity in the brain with normal aging.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative measures of anisotropy in 26 regions, including subcortical WM (i.e., in the gyri), cortical GM, major deep WM, and deep GM regions of young (21-25 years, N = 8) and elderly (61-74 years, N = 10) normal volunteers, were assessed with CSF-suppressed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) relative to standard DTI.    RESULTS: CSF-suppressed DTI demonstrated significant increases in fractional anisotropy (FA) of 3-12% in the young and 2-14% in the elderly groups with the largest changes being in the subcortical WM of the gyri. Furthermore, FA decreased by 10-19% in the subcortical WM of the gyri of the…
20633000	Effects of aging and gender on the spatial organization of nuclei in single human skeletal muscle cells.	aging	2010-10-??	The skeletal muscle fibre is a syncitium where each myonucleus regulates the gene products in a finite volume of the cytoplasm, i.e., the myonuclear domain (MND). We analysed aging- and gender-related effects on myonuclei organization and the MND size in single muscle fibres from six young (21-31 years) and nine old men (72-96 years), and from six young (24-32 years) and nine old women (65-96 years), using a novel image analysis algorithm applied to confocal images. Muscle fibres were classified according to myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression. Our image analysis algorithm was effective in determining the spatial organization of myonuclei and the distribution of individual MNDs along the single fibre segments. Significant linear relations were observed between MND size and fibre size, irrespective age, gender and MyHC isoform expression. The spatial organization of individual myonuclei, calculated as the distribution of nearest neighbour distances in 3D, and MND size were affe…
19016935	Association between testosterone and estradiol and age-related decline in physical function in a diverse sample of men.	aging	2008-11-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between aging and physical function in men by testing a theoretically based model of aging, hormones, body composition, strength, and physical function with data obtained from men enrolled in the Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational survey.    SETTING: Population-based.    PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred ten black, Hispanic, and white randomly selected men from the Boston area aged 30 to 79.    MEASUREMENTS: Testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, lean and fat mass, grip strength, and summated index of physical function (derived from walk and chair stand tests).    RESULTS: Measures of grip strength and physical function declined strongly with age. For instance, 10 years of aging was associated with a 0.49-point difference (scale 0-7) in physical function. Age differences in total testosterone and estradiol concentrations were smaller than age differences in their free fractions…
14977873	Muscle fat oxidative capacity is not impaired by age but by physical inactivity: association with insulin sensitivity.	aging	2004-04-??	The study aimed at determining whether aging and/or sedentariness impairs muscle fat oxidative capacity (OXFA) and whether this was associated with increased risk to develop insulin resistance. We first examined muscle mitochondrial functions, OXFA and insulin sensitivity (ISI; evaluated during an oral glucose tolerance test) in a cross-sectional study with 32 sedentary (S) and endurance-trained (T), young (Y) and elderly (E) men (24.2+/-2.6 vs. 66.6+/-3.2 yr). As for mitochondrial functions, OXFA was higher in T than in S but similar between age groups (SY 41.8+/-11.3, TY 68.0+/-17.7, SE 40.1+/-14.1, TE 73.1+/-20.1 palmitate x min(-1) x g wet tissue(-1); activity P<0.0001, age P=NS, activity x age P=NS). Similar results were obtained with ISI (SY 6.2+/-2.2, TY 11.4+/-4.4, SE 5.9+/-1.5, TE 11.0+/-3.5, activity P<0.001, age P=NS, activity x age P=NS). Stepwise regression showed that, among body composition, VO2max and muscle biochemical characteristics, OXFA was the main predictor of IS…
22414593	Social economic decision-making across the lifespan: An fMRI investigation.	aging	2012-06-??	Recent research in neuroeconomics suggests that social economic decision-making may be best understood as a dual-systems process, integrating the influence of deliberative and affective subsystems. However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults. Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The partners' proposals involved splitting an amount of money between the two players, and ranged from $1 to $5 (from a $10 pot). Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable offers and rejected moderately unfair offers ($3) to a larger extent. Imaging results revealed that, relative to …
28287306	Sex-Based Differences in the Determinants of Old Age Life Expectancy: The Influence of Perimenopause.	longevity, aging	2017-??-??	Studies using the sensitive periods framework typically examine the effects of early life exposures on later life health, due to the significant growth and development occurring during the first few years of life. The menopausal transition (i.e., perimenopause) is similarly characterized by rapid physiological change, yet rarely has been tested as a sensitive window in adulthood. Cohort mortality data drawn from three historic populations, Sweden (1751-1919), France (1816-1919), and England and Wales (1841-1919), were analyzed using time series methods to assess whether conditions at midlife significantly influenced or "programmed" later life longevity. Results indicated a significant inverse association between mortality at ages 45-49, the average age range in which perimenopause occurred, and life expectancy at age 60 among females in all three countries. Study findings suggest a degree of plasticity associated with women's aging and, in particular, the age group correlated with peri…
23183637	Mental images across the adult lifespan: a behavioural and fMRI investigation of motor execution and motor imagery.	aging	2013-02-??	Motor imagery (M.I.) is a mental state in which real movements are evoked without overt actions. There is some behavioural evidence that M.I. declines with ageing. The neurofunctional correlates of these changes have been investigated only in two studies, but none of the these studies has measured explicit correlations between behavioural variables and the brain response, nor the correlation of M.I. and motor execution (M.E.) of the same acts in ageing. In this paper, we report a behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment that aimed to address this issue. Twenty-four young subjects (27 ± 5.6 years) and twenty-four elderly subjects (60 ± 4.6 years) performed two block-design fMRI tasks requiring actual movement (M.E.) or the mental rehearsal (M.I.) of finger movements. Participants also underwent a behavioural mental chronometry test in which the temporal correlations between M.I. and M.E. were measured. We found significant neurofunctional and behavioural d…
8388010	Characterization of the skin in vivo by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging: water behavior and age-related effects.	aging	1993-05-??	The age-related modifications of magnetic resonance imaging parameters in the skin have been studied in vivo. Modification of these parameters should provide important information about alterations in water structure and content in aged skin. Relaxation times, T1 and T2, and relative proton density, which corresponds to the mobile water proton fraction of tissues, have been measured on people under age 40 and over 70 on a sun-protected area. Results have confirmed in vivo skin layer differentiation through relaxation times performed in a previous study. Moreover, relative proton density quantification has shown that epidermal mobile water is at least twice as abundant as dermal mobile water. No significant age-related T1 and T2 modification could be established, basically because of a large dispersion of values. The main result concerns the upper part of dermis (about 200 microns in thickness) which contains significantly more mobile water protons in chronologic aged skin than in young…
20107069	Variability in nucleus accumbens activity mediates age-related suboptimal financial risk taking.	aging	2010-01-27	As human life expectancy continues to rise, financial decisions of aging investors may have an increasing impact on the global economy. In this study, we examined age differences in financial decisions across the adult life span by combining functional neuroimaging with a dynamic financial investment task. During the task, older adults made more suboptimal choices than younger adults when choosing risky assets. This age-related effect was mediated by a neural measure of temporal variability in nucleus accumbens activity. These findings reveal a novel neural mechanism by which aging may disrupt rational financial choice.
3335748	The effect of age on serum albumin in healthy males: report from the Normative Aging Study.	aging	1988-01-??	To clarify the relation between age and serum albumin, measures were obtained on a screened population of 1066 healthy males in the Normative Aging Study. Multiple regression analysis shows only a slight decline in albumin of 0.054 gm/dl per decade with R = -0.12 (p less than .001) on cross-sectional data. This small decline occurs entirely within the range of normal, contrary to many previous reports. Mean albumin values were 4.25 (+/- .26 SD) for subjects in the eighth decade and 4.13 (+/- .29 SD) in the ninth decade. Longitudinally, there was an upwards trend in albumin for five birth cohorts over an 8-yr period which may reflect laboratory drift. A multivariate model of cross-sectional data can explain only 5% of the variance. The age-related decline within healthy subjects is far less than previously described. Our data demonstrate that hypoalbuminemia is not a consequence of normal aging.
21109311	Effects of environmental factors on the longevous people in China.	longevity	????-??-??	Healthy longevity is associated with environmental conditions, but its significance is still unclear. In China, different age groups of old people may be influenced by different factors. For people aged 65 and above, their distribution may be more influenced by the economical factor, decreasing from east to west. However, for people aged 100 and above, they may be more influenced by the environmental factors. The number of centenarians per 100,000 is opposite to the percentage of people above 65, decreasing from west to east. Longevity index (LI%) and centenarity index (CI%) may be as index to evaluate the longevity level. The biggest LI% is in the south provinces of China, whereas the biggest CI% is in the northwestern provinces of China. The South China and Northwestern China are two longevity regions. The South China has some climatic preferences including near to the sea, having suitable mean year temperature, a large plenty of rainfall, higher relative humidity, which contribute t…
3677781	Bruch's membrane age-related changes vary by region.	aging	1987-10-??	Aging changes known to occur in Bruch's membrane may be associated with drusen formation and retinal pigment epithelial mottling, which often have a peripheral as well as a macular distribution. Few details of peripheral Bruch's membrane aging changes have been reported. We conducted a histochemical investigation of Bruch's membrane in 31 postmortem donor eyes and an ultrastructural morphometric investigation of these regional changes in a subgroup of 22 eyes. The age of our donors ranged from 12 days to 80 years. When we reacted 5 micron paraffin embedded sections of chorio-retinal complex fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde-1% paraformaldehyde, we observed increased PAS positivity, and staining with Weigert's elastin and alcian blue at pH 2.5 in Bruch's membranes from donors over 46 years. In this older group, the macula showed increased histochemical reactivity for glycoconjugates, glycosaminoglycans, collagen and elastin as compared with the equator and periphery. Thickening of Bruch's memb…
17445994	How dietary restriction catalyzed the evolution of the human brain: An exposition of the nutritional neurotrophic neoteny theory.	longevity, lifespan	2007-??-??	The purpose of this theoretical treatise is to explain the evolution of human encephalization. The evolutionary expansion of the human brain is herein regarded as a single component of an interrelated complex encompassing depressed somatic and sexual development and increased longevity. These cardinal phenotypic features, termed the Quadripartite Complex, were selected for their adaptiveness amidst the environmental deterioration extant during the formative phase of human evolution--the Plio-Pleistocene period. This interval of environmental transformation inevitably eventuated in ecological alteration and dietary diminution. Suggestively, experimentally imposed dietary restriction routinely results in lengthened lifespan, delayed sexual maturation, depressed growth and increased encephalization as a concomitant consequence of body mass reduction and brain mass maintenance. Thus, dietary restriction ostensibly induces discernible metabolic adaptations whether incurred ontologically or …
10852453	Impact of age on cortisol secretory dynamics basally and as driven by nutrient-withdrawal stress.	aging	2000-06-??	The present study tests the clinical hypothesis that aging impairs homeostatic adaptations of cortisol secretion to stress. To this end, we implemented a short-term 3.5-day fast as an ethically acceptable metabolic stressor in eight young (ages 18-35 yr) and eight older (ages 60-72 yr) healthy men. Volunteers were studied in randomly ordered fed vs. fasting sessions. To capture the more complex dynamics of cortisol's feedback control, blood was sampled every 10 min for 24 h for later RIA of serum cortisol concentrations and quantitation of the pulsatile, entropic, and 24-h rhythmic modes of cortisol release using deconvolution analysis, the approximate entropy statistic, and cosine regression, respectively. The stress of fasting elevated the mean (24-h) serum cortisol concentration equivalently in the two age cohorts [i.e. from 7.2 +/- 0.35 to 11.6 +/- 0.71 microg/dL in young men and from 7.7 +/- 0.39 to 12.6 +/- 0.59 microg/dL in older individuals (P < 10(-7))]. The rise in integrated…
12086700	Comparison of the level of mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation in esophageal epithelium and myocardium from individuals of very advanced age.	longevity, aging	2002-07-??	The A3243G mutation, one of the changes of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that accumulates in cells during aging, is a useful marker for investigating the aging of cells. We measured the mutation level of the mtDNA A3243G mutation using DNAs from two different tissues (esophageal epithelium and myocardium) from advanced elderly individuals. The mean level of the A3243G mutation for the esophageal epithelium was 0.0063+/-0.0019, and that for the myocardium was 0.0098+/-0.0031. The mutation level in the myocardium was significantly higher than that in the esophageal epithelium, indicating that more mtDNA A3243G mutations accumulated in the myocardium than in the esophageal epithelium. Since the myocardium is static with respect to cell turnover, but in the esophageal epithelium renewal is very rapid, it is possible that the mtDNA A3243G mutation in the myocardium accumulates more rapidly than in the esophageal epithelium. This phenomenon may reflect the difference in the longevity of ce…
22605573	Dietary fat types and 4-year cognitive change in community-dwelling older women.	aging	2012-07-??	OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to relate dietary fat types to cognitive change in healthy community-based elders.    METHODS: Among 6,183 older participants in the Women's Health Study, we related intake of major fatty acids (saturated [SFA], monounsaturated [MUFA], total polyunsaturated [PUFA], trans-unsaturated) to late-life cognitive trajectory. Serial cognitive testing, conducted over 4 years, began 5 years after dietary assessment. Primary outcomes were global cognition (averaging tests of general cognition, verbal memory, and semantic fluency) and verbal memory (averaging tests of recall). We used analyses of response profiles and logistic regression to estimate multivariate-adjusted differences in cognitive trajectory and risk of worst cognitive change (worst 10%) by fat intake.    RESULTS: Higher SFA intake was associated with worse global cognitive (p for linear trend = 0.008) and verbal memory (p for linear trend = 0.01) trajectories. There was a higher risk of worst cogni…
23887477	Age-related changes in male skin: quantitative evaluation of one hundred and fifty male subjects.	aging	2014-??-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Modern men have changed their beauty and grooming habits, which has resulted in an increasing demand for cosmetics for men. However, very little information is available about the dermatological needs of male skin. Therefore, the aim of this present clinical study was to conduct the first systematic assessment of the skin physiology of men with special attention to lifetime changes.    METHODS: A total of 150 healthy male subjects (aged 20-70 years) were selected following strict criteria, including age, sun behavior and smoking habits. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), hydration level, sebum production and pH values were measured with worldwide-acknowledged biophysical measuring methods at the forehead, cheek, neck, volar forearm and dorsum of hand.    RESULTS: TEWL and sebum production vary by localization, but generally not with increasing age, whereas stratum corneum (SC) hydration decreases significantly at the face and neck. The greatest decrease was assessed …
27351339	Regional distributions of brain glutamate and glutamine in normal subjects.	aging	2016-??-??	Glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) play an important role in neuronal regulation and are of value as MRS-observable diagnostic biomarkers. In this study the relative concentrations of these metabolites have been measured in multiple regions in the normal brain using a short-TE whole-brain MRSI measurement at 3 T combined with a modified data analysis approach that used spatial averaging to obtain high-SNR spectra from atlas-registered anatomic regions or interest. By spectral fitting of high-SNR spectra this approach yielded reliable measurements across a wide volume of the brain. Spectral averaging also demonstrated increased SNR and improved fitting accuracy for the sum of Glu and Gln (Glx) compared with individual voxel fitting. Results in 26 healthy controls showed relatively constant Glu/Cr and Gln/Cr throughout the cerebrum, although with increased values in the anterior cingulum and paracentral lobule, and increased Gln/Cr in the superior motor area. The deep gray-matter region…
16461559	Plasma ghrelin levels in healthy elderly volunteers: the levels of acylated ghrelin in elderly females correlate positively with serum IGF-I levels and bowel movement frequency and negatively with systolic blood pressure.	aging	2006-02-??	Aging is associated with a decrease in growth hormone (GH) secretion, appetite and energy intake. As ghrelin stimulates both GH secretion and appetite, reductions in ghrelin levels may be involved in the reductions in GH secretion and appetite observed in the elderly. However, only preliminary studies have been performed on the role of ghrelin in elderly subjects. In this study, we sought to clarify the physiologic implications of the age-related alterations in ghrelin secretion by determining plasma ghrelin levels and other clinical parameters in healthy elderly subjects. Subjects were > or = 65 years old, corresponding to the SENIEUR protocol, had not had a resection of the upper gastrointestinal tract and had not been treated with hormones. One hundred and five volunteers (49 men and 56 women) were admitted to this study (73.4 +/- 6.3 years old). Plasma levels of acylated ghrelin in elderly female subjects positively correlated with serum IGF-I levels and bowel movement frequency an…
14749134	Serotonin modulation of cerebral glucose metabolism in normal aging.	aging	2004-02-??	Age-related alterations in serotonin function may increase the vulnerability to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders in late life. The neuroendocrine and cerebral metabolic response to the acute administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (40mg, IV), was measured in 17 normal control subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate changes in serotonin function with normal aging. The citalopram-induced change in cerebral metabolism was positively correlated with age in the right precuneus, right paracentral lobule, and left middle temporal gyrus and negatively correlated with age in the left anterior cingulate gyrus, right inferior and middle frontal gyri, right insula, and right inferior parietal lobule. The positive correlations in mainly posterior brain regions indicate that normal aging is associated with an increase in metabolism after citalopram administration, whereas the negative correlations in mainly anterior brain regions indi…
20843948	Changes in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) throughout the life span: a population-based study of 1027 healthy males from birth (cord blood) to the age of 69 years.	aging	2010-12-??	CONTEXT: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is secreted by immature Sertoli cells, triggers the involution of the fetal Müllerian ducts. AMH is a testis-specific marker used for diagnosis in infants with ambiguous genitalia or bilateral cryptorchidism.    AIM: The aim of the study was to describe the ontogeny of AMH secretion through life in healthy males.    SETTING: This was a population-based study of healthy volunteers.    PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS included 1027 healthy males from birth (cord blood) to 69 yr. A subgroup was followed up longitudinally through the infantile minipuberty [(in cord blood, and at 3 and 12 months), n=55] and another group through puberty [(biannual measurements), n=83].    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum AMH was determined by a sensitive immunoassay. Serum testosterone, LH, and FSH were measured, and pubertal staging was performed in boys aged 6 to 20 yr (n=616).    RESULTS: Serum AMH was above the detection limit in all samples with a marked variation acc…
11757878	Context processing in older adults: evidence for a theory relating cognitive control to neurobiology in healthy aging.	aging	2001-12-??	A theory of cognitive aging is presented in which healthy older adults are hypothesized to suffer from disturbances in the processing of context that impair cognitive control function across multiple domains, including attention, inhibition, and working memory. These cognitive disturbances are postulated to be directly related to age-related decline in the function of the dopamine (DA) system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A connectionist computational model is described that implements specific mechanisms for the role of DA and PFC in context processing. The behavioral predictions of the model were tested in a large sample of older (N = 81) and young (N = 175) adults performing variants of a simple cognitive control task that placed differential demands on context processing. Older adults exhibited both performance decrements and, counterintuitively, performance improvements that are in close agreement with model predictions.
29233718	Right anterior cerebellum BOLD responses reflect age related changes in Simon task sequential effects.	aging	2018-??-31	Participants are slower to report a feature, such as color, when the target appears on the side opposite the instructed response, than when the target appears on the same side. This finding suggests that target location, even when task-irrelevant, interferes with response selection. This effect is magnified in older adults. Lengthening the inter-trial interval, however, suffices to normalize the congruency effect in older adults, by re-establishing young-like sequential effects (Aisenberg et al., 2014). We examined the neurological correlates of age related changes by comparing BOLD signals in young and old participants performing a visual version of the Simon task. Participants reported the color of a peripheral target, by a left or right-hand keypress. Generally, BOLD responses were greater following incongruent than congruent targets. Also, they were delayed and of smaller amplitude in old than young participants. BOLD responses in visual and motor regions were also affected by the …
11158007	Human glucocorticoid feedback inhibition is reduced in older individuals: evening study.	aging	2001-02-??	We have previously shown that when tested in the morning, older men and women, pretreated with metyrapone to block endogenous cortisol synthesis, exhibit delayed suppression of plasma ACTH in response to cortisol infusion. To confirm this finding and to determine whether aging-related changes in feedback responsiveness are exaggerated near the time of the circadian nadir in adrenocortical secretion, we performed a similar study in the evening. Healthy young (20-35 yr, n = 22) and old (>65 yr, n = 21) men and women were administered metyrapone orally (750 mg) at 1600 and 1900 h, followed by a cortisol infusion of 0.06 mg/kg/h for 150 min. Blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals for 4 h following infusion onset for measurement of plasma ACTH, cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and corticosteroid binding globulin. When corrections were made for differences in circulating cortisol concentrations achieved among age and gender subgroups, feedback inhibition of ACTH was found to be significantl…
7593343	Age dependency of changes in cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation during brain activation: a near-infrared spectroscopy study.	aging	1995-11-??	We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to study noninvasively the influence of aging on changes in the local concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin ([HbO2]), reduced hemoglobin ([HbR]), and total hemoglobin ([HbT] = [HbR] + [HbO2]) during activation of brain function. Young subjects (n = 12; age, 28 +/- 4 years) performing calculation tasks showed an increase in [HbO2] [mean (arbitrary units) +/- SD, 2.36 +/- 1.07] and [HbT] (2.24 +/- 1.13) in the frontal cortex, while [HbR] (-0.11 +/- 0.48) decreased. Elderly subjects (n = 17; age, 52 +/- 10 years) showed a significantly lower mean increase (p < 0.05) in [HbO2] and [HbT] levels (1.21 +/- 1.38 and 0.72 +/- 1.41, respectively). Regression analysis supports the hypothesis of an age-dependent decline in the activation-induced local increase in [HbO2] (y = -0.241x + 20.062; r = -0.431, p < 0.05) as well as [HbT] (y = -0.346x + 22.496; r = -0.568, p < 0.05). We conclude that NIRS is a promising approach for studying changes in Hb oxygena…
19085240	Influence of aging on biological properties of periodontal ligament cells.	aging	2008-??-??	The majority of patients eligible for periodontal regenerative therapies are aged subjects. Since periodontal ligament cells (PDLC) are essential for periodontal regeneration, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of cellular aging on PDLC, including genes associated with extracellular matrix metabolism and growth-associated factors. PDLC cultures were obtained from subjects aged 15 to 20 years and subjects aged more than 60 years. Proliferation, cell viability, mineralization assays, and mRNA levels were assessed for type I and III collagen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and-8, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and-2. Data analysis demonstrated that aging negatively influenced cell proliferation and mineral nodule formation (p < 0.05). Gene expression analysis further showed that mRNA levels for bFGF, PDGF-1, and TIMP-2 were not affected by aging (p > 0.05). In addition, mR…
26086247	Uncoupling of Elastin Complex Receptor during In Vitro Aging Is Related to Modifications in Its Intrinsic Sialidase Activity and the Subsequent Lactosylceramide Production.	aging	2015-??-??	Degradation of elastin leads to the production of elastin-derived peptides (EDP), which exhibit several biological effects, such as cell proliferation or protease secretion. Binding of EDP on the elastin receptor complex (ERC) triggers lactosylceramide (LacCer) production and ERK1/2 activation following ERC Neu-1 subunit activation. The ability for ERC to transduce signals is lost during aging, but the mechanism involved is still unknown. In this study, we characterized an in vitro model of aging by subculturing human dermal fibroblasts. This model was used to understand the loss of EDP biological activities during aging. Our results show that ERC uncoupling does not rely on Neu-1 or PPCA mRNA or protein level changes. Furthermore, we observe that the membrane targeting of these subunits is not affected with aging. However, we evidence that Neu-1 activity and LacCer production are altered. Basal Neu-1 catalytic activity is strongly increased in aged cells. Consequently, EDP fail to pro…
25923484	Intake of antioxidants and subsequent decline in physical function in a racially/ethnically diverse population.	aging	2015-05-??	OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress is considered a risk factor for physical function (PF) decline with aging. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between antioxidant intake and change in PF over a 5-year period.    DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey is a population-based longitudinal study including 5,502 racially/ethnically diverse and randomly selected participants aged 30-79 years.    MEASUREMENTS: In total, 2828 persons aged 30-79 years completed the validated Block Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and participated in the follow-up study. Change in PF from baseline (2002-2005) to follow-up (2006-2010) was assessed using the validated SF-12 questionnaire. Linear models were used to examine the association between energy-adjusted quartiles of vitamins C, E and carotenoids and change in PF.    RESULTS: A low intake (first quartile) of vitamin E was associated with a greater decline in PF compared with the highest quartile,…
11322415	Gender- and age-related differences in corneal topography.	aging	2001-04-??	PURPOSE: To investigate gender- and age-related differences in the corneal topography of a normal population.    METHODS: One hundred thirty-two topographic examinations were collected from 100 patients ranging in age from 23 to 83 years (average, 57.35+/-17.38 years). Data were segregated by gender and further divided into younger (less than 50 years) and older (50 years or more) age groups. The topographic indices of Surface Regularity Index, Surface Asymmetry Index, Irregular Astigmatism Index, Standard Deviation of Corneal Power, Corneal Eccentricity Index, Coefficient of Variation of Corneal Power, Simulated Keratometry 1 and 2, and Average Corneal Power were examined. The astigmatism pattern and corneal irregularity were determined and compared with respect to gender and age.    RESULTS: The corneas of older men were flatter than those of older women (p < 0.001). The vertical corneal meridian, but not the horizontal meridian, showed statistically significant gender-related change…
12574671	Iron and ascorbic acid concentrations in human dermis with regard to age and body sites.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to processes relating to cutaneous aging. Iron catalyses ROS formation whereas ascorbic acid (AA) plays a fundamental role in defending the organism against undesirable ROS action.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to determine the ex vivo iron and AA concentrations in human dermis from different age groups to better understand their role.    METHODS: Skin fragments were collected from 66 female patients during surgical operations and were grouped according to age: group I (<15 years, before puberty, n = 12), group II (15-50 years, adults, n = 42), and group III (>50 years, advanced age adults, n = 12). Two sites were investigated: the abdomen (unexposed areas) and face (exposed sites). Iron and AA were collected from human dermis by microdialysis and assessed by atomic absorption spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively.    RESULTS: Iron concentrations in the dermis were significantly higher in group …
24584261	Social gradient in allostatic load among Danish men and women in late midlife.	aging	2014-02-??	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study is to describe the prevalence of allostatic load (AL) among Danish men and women in late midlife, and if there is a social gradient in AL.    METHOD: A total of 5,420 participants from the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank (CAMB) aged 48 to 63 years (68.5% men, 31.5% women) underwent a health examination including standardized measures of height, weight, body fat, and blood pressure in 2009-2011. AL (range 0-14) was established by summing the scores of the poorest quartile for each of 14 biological variables related to the metabolic and immune systems.    RESULTS: We found a social gradient in AL in late midlife among men and women living in Denmark.    DISCUSSION: AL may be a potential biomarker for early aging in countries with a strong social welfare system. It is important for intervention studies to be aware of this type of biological vulnerability already present in late midlife.
26051931	Interleukin-6 as a first-rated serum inflammatory marker to predict mortality and hospitalization in the oldest old: A regression and CART approach in the BELFRAIL study.	aging	2015-09-??	BACKGROUND: Certain inflammatory biomarkers increase with age, provide information about general burden of illness and could cause or reflect any collateral damage to healthy cells and organs. However, comparative studies to predict adverse outcomes are missing. Therefore, our study validated and identified the principal prognostic marker to predict important adverse outcomes in the oldest old from an extensive battery of serum inflammatory markers.    METHODS: A large battery of potential 'inflammaging' markers (IL-1α, IL1-β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, EGF, VEGF, MCP-1, usCRP, prealbumin) was assessed in a representative sample of 415 heterogenic individuals 80years of age or older in the BELFRAIL study. Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards and CART analyses determined the overall prognostic value of these markers for predicting all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality as well as hospitalization.    RESULTS: Serum IL-6 and usCRP levels were strongly ass…
8979154	Neutrophil migration, oxidative metabolism, and adhesion in elderly and young subjects.	aging	1996-12-??	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate neutrophil functions in the elderly.    METHODS: We investigated the PMN migration in vivo and PMN superoxide production and adhesion in response to a variety of compounds; PMN have been isolated both from blood and from a skin experimental exudate (obtained by Senn's skin window technique) of 25 normal elderly and of 25 normal young control subjects.    RESULTS: No difference was found in PMN migration in vivo (62.9 +/- 21.3 x 10(6) and 65.5 +/- 9.1 x 10(6) PMN/cm2/24 hours in elderly and young subjects respectively), neither were different the adhesion under basal condition and after some stimuli and the superoxide production in basal condition and in response to STZ and PMA in two groups. In elderly subjects superoxide production, in response to fMLP, markedly resulted lower than in young controls both by circulating PMNs (3.6 +/- 2.7 and 9.3 +/- 3.3 nMOLES O2-/10(6) PMN respectively, p < 0.0001) and by exudate PMNs (13.6 +/- 4.3 and 19.4 +/- 6 nMOLES O2-/10(6…
15486096	Analysis of bidirectional pattern synchrony of concentration-secretion pairs: implementation in the human testicular and adrenal axes.	aging	2005-02-??	The hypothalamo-pituitary-testicular and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axes are prototypical coupled neuroendocrine systems. In the present study, we contrasted in vivo linkages within and between these two axes using methods without linearity assumptions. We examined 11 young (21-31 yr) and 8 older (62-74 yr) men who underwent frequent (every 2.5 min) blood sampling overnight for paired measurement of LH and testosterone and 35 adults (17 women and 18 men; 26-77 yr old) who underwent adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol measurements every 10 min for 24 h. To mirror physiological interactions, hormone secretion was first deconvolved from serial concentrations with a waveform-independent biexponential elimination model. Feedforward synchrony, feedback synchrony, and the difference in feedforward-feedback synchrony were quantified by the cross-approximate entropy (X-ApEn) statistic. These were applied in a forward (LH concentration template, examining pattern recurrence in tes…
20433829	Localization of low molecular weight crystallin peptides in the aging human lens using a MALDI mass spectrometry imaging approach.	aging	2010-07-??	Low molecular weight (LMW) peptides, derived from the breakdown of the major eye lens proteins, the crystallins, accumulate in the human lens with age. These LMW peptides are associated with age-related lens opacity and cataract, with some shown to inhibit the chaperone activity of alpha-crystallin. However, the mechanism(s) giving rise to the production of these peptides, as well as their distribution within the lens, are not well understood. In this study, we have mapped the distribution of these crystallin-derived peptides present in human lenses of different ages using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). Our data showed that most of these LMW peptides emerge in the lens at early middle-age, with peptides greater than 1778 Da in mass being confined to the water insoluble fractions, and to a lesser extent the water soluble fractions of older lenses. MALDI-IMS analyses showed that four peptides, derived from alphaA-, alphaB- and gammaS-cr…
19527329	A new source of aging?	aging	2009-06-??	There has been a considerable increase in understanding how skin ages, along with significant progress toward the correction and prevention of the visible signs of aging. However, there are still many unknown factors regarding why we age - and why we all seem to age differently. An area of high interest is the biological or intrinsic processes that affect our appearance over time. This article describes a recent discovery of a membrane bound enzyme proven to be present in skin and increases its activity as biological age increases. The enzyme is located on the external surface of both fibroblast and keratinocytes, and generates free radicals. Therefore, as we age there appears to be a biological mechanism that further increases the production of free radicals. Additionally, there appears to be a relationship between activity of the enzyme and appearance. Data showed that subjects who look younger than their biological age had lower enzyme activity and conversely, subjects who looked ol…
8819096	Age-related tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation defect in human T lymphocytes activated through CD3, CD4, CD8 or the IL-2 receptor.	aging	1996-07-17	Although transmembrane signaling defect has been recognized as one of the major functional alterations involved in immune senescence, its biochemical nature as well as its precise molecular localization are still unknown. The available data indicate that an early step in the signaling cascade may be affected during the aging process. Because protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are ubiquitously implicated in the initiation of physiological signals, they appear as prime candidates for age-related changes. The present investigation examined the effect of age on the activity of PTK associated with CD3, CD4, CD8 or the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) in human T lymphocytes. By comparison with cells derived from young individuals, anti-CD3-activated T lymphocytes from elderly donors were more susceptible to herbimycin A, a PTK inhibitor known to prevent signal transduction by the T cell antigen receptor. This increased sensitivity of cells from senescent organisms to PTK inhibitors is most likely related t…
18846469	Protective role of tea catechins on erythrocytes subjected to oxidative stress during human aging.	aging	2009-??-??	Antioxidant effect of tea catechins has been shown in many epidemiological studies. In the present study we report the protective mechanism of tea catechins (EGCG, ECG, EGC, EC) on various oxidative stress parameters, which are elevated during aging in humans. We hereby report the in vitro effect of tea catechins on erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and on membrane sulphydryl (-SH) group in humans. Results show an age-dependent increase in erythrocyte MDA level and a decrease in GSH and membrane-SH group concentration. We report that tea catechins show significant protection to erythrocyte against oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). The effect was more pronounced in older age group compared to lower age group. The findings suggest a possible role of tea catechins as anti-aging compounds.
10360687	The mechanisms of simultaneous stereoinversion, racemization, and isomerization at specific aspartyl residues of aged lens proteins.	aging	1999-03-15	Proteins have been considered to consist exclusively of L-amino acids in living tissues. However, we found biologically uncommon D-aspartyl (Asp) residues at specific sites in alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin from the aged human lens (mean age: 80 years). In alphaB-crystallin, the Asp-36 and Asp-62 residues are highly racemized (D/L ratios: 0.92 for Asp-36; 0.54 for Asp-62). More interestingly, the configuration of the Asp-58 and Asp-151 residues in alphaA-crystallin is inverted to the D-isomer (D/L ratio: 3.1 for Asp-58, 5.7 for Asp-151). A D/L ratio > 1.0 is not considered to be due to racemization, but rather is thought to result from stereoconfiguration inversion. Our report was the first observation that inversion occurred in the configuration of amino acids in vivo during the natural aging process. We also found that these enantiomers were simultaneously isomerized to form beta-Asp residues. We propose that the mechanism of D- and beta-Asp formation in the protein depends on the pri…
11229429	Contrasting effects of L-arginine on insulin-mediated blood flow and glucose disposal in the elderly.	aging	2001-02-??	Insulin increases skeletal muscle blood flow in healthy young subjects by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. Impairment of this mechanism may contribute to the insulin resistance of normal aging. We tested the hypothesis that L-arginine, the endogenous precursor for NO synthesis, would augment insulin-mediated vasodilation and in so doing increase insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) in healthy elderly subjects. Experiments were conducted on healthy young (n = 9; age, 24 +/- 1 years; body mass index, 24 +/- 1 kg/m2) and old (n = 9; age, 77 +/- 2 years; BMI, 25 +/- 1 kg/m2) subjects. Each underwent two euglycemic clamp studies. On both occasions, insulin was infused from 0 to 120 minutes (young, 40 mU/m2/min; old, 34 mU/m2/min). On 1 day, insulin was continued and L-arginine (7.5 mg/kg/min) was coinfused from 120 to 240 minutes. On the second study day, the insulin infusion from 120 minutes onward was adjusted in each subject to match corresponding plasma concentrations during t…
2148706	The effect of aging on the D1 dopamine receptors in human frontal cortex.	aging	1990-10-01	Dopaminergic pathways to the cerebral cortex may be involved in cognitive function. We examined the effect of aging on the D1 dopamine receptors, and their high-agonist affinity (RH) sites, in postmortem human frontal cortex (n = 32; age range, 19-88 years). With aging, there was a significant decrease in the densities of the D1 dopamine receptors, and their RH sites, in human frontal cortex. The age-related reduction of cortical dopaminergic neurotransmission might contribute to the decline in cognitive abilities of elderly persons.
14580865	The effect of age and gender on cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and markers of bone metabolism.	aging	2003-10-??	BACKGROUND: Aging has been associated with various alterations of immune functions, the musculoskeletal system and a decline of sex hormone levels. Estradiol has a central role in the regulation of bone turnover and also modulates the production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 and -6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We therefore studied the effect of age and gender on cytokine production by mononuclear cells and markers of bone metabolism.    METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from young and elderly subjects; intracellular detection of cytokine production after stimulation with ionomycine and PMA (T cells) or LPS (monocytes) was performed by four color flow cytometry. Sex hormone levels and markers of bone metabolism were measured by RIA or ELISA:    RESULTS: When we compared elderly to young women we found an increased proportion of T cells that were positive for interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, -4, -10 and -13. Also the percentage of cells producing interleu…
15998772	Relationship of volumetric bone density and structural parameters at different skeletal sites to sex steroid levels in women.	aging	2005-09-??	CONTEXT: Although estrogen clearly plays a central role in regulating bone mass in women, studies in men have suggested that there may be a threshold bioavailable (bio) estradiol (E2) level below which aging men begin to lose bone and that the threshold for estrogen deficiency in cortical bone may be considerably lower than that in trabecular bone. There are no data testing this in women.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone geometry by quantitative computed tomography and relate these to circulating bio E2 and bio testosterone levels.    DESIGN: We studied a cross-sectional, age-stratified population sample of 235 women (age, 21-97 yr).    RESULTS: vBMD/structural parameters were not related to sex steroid levels in young premenopausal women (age, 20-39 yr) with a median bio E2 level of 17 pg/ml (63 pmol/liter). By contrast, bio E2 and bio testosterone levels were both significantly associated with trabecular and cortical vBMD and c…
27425570	Are neuroticism and extraversion related to morning cortisol release in healthy older people?	aging	2016-??-??	The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is a discrete component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) function that has been widely related to both health and some personality traits. There is evidence that neuroticism and extraversion affect health and well-being and play a damaging or protective role, respectively. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between these personality dimensions and morning cortisol concentrations in people aged 55 or older. To do so, morning saliva samples were collected on two consecutive weekdays from a total of 160 older men and women. Neuroticism and extraversion were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, short form (EPQ-RS). Our results showed that neuroticism was negatively related to overall morning cortisol concentrations (AUC) (i.e., area under the curve with respect to the ground in cortisol levels), but not to the CAR. When we explored sex as a moderator, neuroticism was related to a CAR of inc…
3376053	Platelets and aging. II--Plasma lipoproteins and fatty acid profiles.	aging	1988-03-01	Lipid composition of both plasma and platelets were investigated in sixteen old (78-94 years) and eight young (25-35 years) subjects. No age-related change was noted in plasma total and HDL cholesterol whereas a slightly increase of triglycerides was observed in the elderly population. Level of apo AI tended to decrease while apo AII decreased significantly in the elderly. These results led to a higher apo AI/apo AII ratio in elder subjects. However, no difference was detected in the level of apo B. In contrast, several modifications appeared in fatty acid composition of plasma lipids. Primarily, monounsaturated fatty acids content was increased while level of linoleic acid (and arachidonic acid in phospholipids) decreased in each class of plasma lipids of elderly subjects. In platelets from the elderly, we found an enhancement of monounsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidyl-inositol (PI), -ethanolamine (PE) and -choline (PC). The decrease of linoleic acid was detected in PC while the r…
1420407	Effect of cholinergic tone on growth hormone-releasing hormone-induced secretion of growth hormone in normal aging.	aging	1992-09-??	Aging is associated with an impairment in the GH response to GHRH and to several other stimuli of GH secretion. We evaluated the effect of pyridostigmine (PD) or placebo pretreatment (Protocol A: placebo or 120 mg PD orally at 8 a.m.; Protocol B: placebo or 60 mg PD twice orally at 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.) on GH responsiveness to GHRH (1 micrograms/kg BW bolus i.v. at 9 a.m.) in 15 normal elderly males (65-92 years) and in 14 normal young adults (20-37 years). GH response to GHRH was significantly reduced in elderly subjects compared to young adults (p < 0.05). PD (Protocol A) increased GH release in both elderly and young subjects. In elderly men, PD enhanced GH response to GHRH. The phenomenon was more evident when PD was administered according to Protocol B (p < 0.01). The area under the curve of GH was significantly greater after PD plus GHRH than it was after placebo plus GHRH (p < 0.01). In young adults, PD induced an increase in GH responsiveness to GHRH when administered according to…
9203529	Apparent absence of aging and gender effects on serotonin 1A receptors in human neocortex and hippocampus.	aging	1997-05-30	The effects of gender, aging and gender x age on the binding of the 5-HT1A receptor high-affinity agonist [3H]8-hydroxy-2(di-N-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT), were evaluated and compared in tissues of human prefrontal, temporal, parietal, occipital cortex and hippocampus obtained from 21 autopsy subjects. The results revealed no variation with age or gender in either the [3H]8-OH-DPAT maximum binding capacity (Bmax) or dissociation constant (Kd) values. On the other hand, when separate correlations to subject ages were performed for men and women, aging effects on [3H]8-OH-DPAT Bmax and Kd were detected: in men, a significant age-dependent decrease in Kd values was observed in the occipital cortex; in women, the Bmax significantly decreased with aging in the parietal cortex and hippocampus, while increasing in occipito-cortical membranes. Overall, the present study reveals that, although neither gender nor aging 'per se' seem to modify the 5-HT1A receptor binding, gender may reve…
9434634	Deregulation of collagen phagocytosis in aging human fibroblasts: effects of integrin expression and cell cycle.	aging	1997-12-15	Intracellular degradation of collagen by phagocytosis in fibroblasts is essential for physiological remodeling of the extracellular matrix in a wide variety of connective tissues but imbalances between degradation and synthesis can lead to loss of tissue collagen. As aging is associated with loss of dermal and periodontal collagen and with increased lysomomal enzyme content in fibroblasts, we examined the regulation of collagen phagocytosis by integrin expression and the cell cycle in an in vitro fibroblast aging model. Two different fibroblast lines (CL1; CL2) at the fourth subculture were passaged up to replicative senescence to model aging processes in vitro. Cells were incubated with collagen-coated or BSA-coated green fluorescent beads for 3 h to assess alpha 2 beta 1-integrin-mediated or nonspecific phagocytosis, respectively. Single-cell suspensions were stained with DAPI and sulforhodamine 101 to separate cycling G1 and noncycling G0 cells. Staining for alpha 2-integrin, bead i…
16143826	Aggrecan, aging and assembly in articular cartilage.	aging	2005-10-??	The primary function of articular cartilage to act as a self-renewing, low frictional material that can distribute load efficiently at joints is critically dependent upon the composition and organisation of the extracellular matrix. Aggrecan is a major component of the extracellular matrix, forming high molecular weight aggregates necessary for the hydration of cartilage and to meet its weight-bearing mechanical demands. Aggregate assembly is a highly ordered process requiring the formation of a ternary complex between aggrecan, link protein and hyaluronan. There is extensive age-associated heterogeneity in the structure and molecular stoichiometry of these components in adult human articular cartilage, resulting in diverse populations of complexes with a range of stabilities that have implications for cartilage mechanobiology and integrity. Recent findings have demonstrated that aggrecan can form ligands with other matrix proteins. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms f…
1521581	Identification of a 9 kDa gamma-crystallin fragment in human lenses.	aging	1992-06-??	The degraded polypeptides (M(r) less than 14 kDa) were isolated by a preparative SDS-PAGE method from water soluble (WS) and water insoluble (WI) proteins of human lenses from donors of ages between 5 and 75 years. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the presence of a major 9 kDa polypeptide species that showed an age-related increase in levels in WS-polypeptide preparations. In order to identify the parent crystallin of the 9 kDa polypeptide, the immunoreactivities of the WS- and WI-degraded polypeptides to immuno-affinity-purified anti-human alpha-, beta- and gamma-crystallin antibodies were determined by the Western blot method. The WS- and WI-9 kDa polypeptides showed immunoreactivity to only the anti-gamma-crystallin antibody suggesting it to be a fragment of gamma-crystallin. A 9 kDa species was purified by Sephadex G-50 chromatography from the WS-protein fraction of lenses from 20-30-year-old donors. The purified polypeptide showed a single protein band during SDS-PAGE and also an apparent…
16621902	Insulin differentially regulates monocyte and polymorphonuclear neutrophil functions in healthy young and elderly humans.	aging	2006-07-??	CONTEXT: Insulin can regulate immune cell function. Aging is associated with various degrees of insulin resistance together with reduced immune cell activity.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated the hypothesis that blood monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are less responsive to the action of insulin in elderly subjects. DESIGN-INTERVENTION: We evaluated the effect of hyperinsulinemia (0.7 mU/kg(-1) fat-free mass per minute(-1)) on monocyte and PMN activity using a 4-h euglycemic clamp technique.    PARTICIPANTS: Eight young (24 +/- 6 yr old) and nine elderly (69 +/- 4 yr old) healthy volunteers participated in the study.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monocyte and PMN receptor expression and density were measured using flow cytometric detection. PMN chemotaxis toward formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was evaluated using a two-compartment chamber. PMN and monocyte phagocytosis was determined by measuring the engulfment of opsonized particles. Microbicidal functions were determined based on…
20647348	Frontiers in the use of biomarkers of health in research on stress and aging.	aging	2010-09-??	Assessment of biomarkers that reflect objective indicators of physiological processes has become increasingly popular in psychological research on stress and aging. The current article reviews biomarkers of the neuroendocrine and immune systems, including issues related to measurement and normative age-related changes. We also discuss how exposure to stressors can provoke changes in these biomarkers and propose that stressful experiences may accelerate age-related declines in these systems. We recommend that future research examining physical health and aging incorporate dynamic and multivariate methods for assessing links between stressors and biomarkers.
221563	Effect of donor age on the binding and degradation of low density lipoproteins by cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells.	aging	1979-07-??	The ability of human arterial smooth muscle cells growing in tissue culture to bind, incorporate and degrade low density lipoproteins (LDL) was studied as a function of cell donor age from 5 to 71 years. LDL binding to cell surface receptors did not change with donor age. However, LDL degradation was significantly decreased in cells from older donors. These results may be relevant to the enhanced accumulation of cellular cholesterol and LDL observed in the aging human artery. Thus, impaired LDL degradation by arterial smooth muscle cells may be one of several factors involved in the accelerated development of atherosclerosis with aging.
7049632	Glucose intolerance and aging.	aging	????-??-??	Glucose tolerance is known to decrease with advancing age. This decline begins in the third or fourth decade of life and is progressive throughout the entire adult life span. The primary cause of this age-related impairment in glucose metabolism results from tissue unresponsiveness to insulin. The plasma insulin response to glucose shows little change with age. Several factors, including decreased physical activity and decreased lean body mass, probably contribute to the insulin resistance. The aging process per se, however, appears to have its own deleterious effect on tissue sensitivity to insulin.
15606793	Age-related loss of naïve T cells and dysregulation of T-cell/B-cell interactions in human lymph nodes.	aging	2005-01-??	In this study we analysed the effects of age on T and B lymphocytes in human lymph nodes by comparing lymphocyte subsets in paraffin sections from lymph node tissue taken from healthy young and elderly people. We demonstrate that the relative number of CD8(+) T cells decreases with age but that the relative number of CD4(+) T cells does not. There is also a very pronounced age-dependent loss of CD45RA(+) naive T cells. The number and size of follicles and the relative number of CD20(+) B cells are similar in young and elderly donors. For polymerase chain reaction analysis of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire the TCR-gamma gene rearrangements were used as a marker of clonality. This is a reliable tool to detect not only clonal TCR-gammadelta populations but also TCR-alphabeta populations. Young donors with clonal T-cell expansions in their lymph node tissue do, however, have a higher number of CD20(+) B cells, a higher relative size of germinal centres compared to the follicle mantle…
10749525	Long-term changes in body potassium concentration and dose from 40K for a Japanese adult male group.	aging	2000-04-??	Total body potassium has been measured for a Japanese adult male group using two whole-body counters. The total body potassium data were analyzed to present the longitudinal data on body potassium concentration in aging individuals. The data for each individual showed that potassium concentration decreased linearly with age from 30 y to 60 y of age. The average decrease rate was -0.0154 +/- 0.0049 g K kg body wt(-1) y(-1). On the other hand, a subject group for each of the 23 years (1975-1998) of the study was divided into three age groups. The same age groups were followed with the course of time to analyze changes in potassium concentration due to other factors besides age. The follow-up study of the same age groups indicated that the average potassium concentration decreased with the course of the 23-y study and that the decrease was due to other factors besides age. The decrease in the average potassium concentration for study subjects is the major cause of the decrease in the aver…
10634362	Effects of aging on adrenal function in the human: responsiveness and sensitivity of adrenal androgens and cortisol to adrenocorticotropin in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.	aging	2000-01-??	We sought to determine the effects of aging on several aspects of adrenal steroidogenesis in the hopes of characterizing the possible causes of adrenal androgen deficiency in elderly women. To this end, we quantified basal morning concentrations of cortisol (F), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DS), and androstenedione (A4) and then evaluated the effects of overnight dexamethasone (DEX) suppression followed by adrenal responses to graded hourly infusions of ACTH, ranging from 20-1280 ng/1.5 m2 x h. Finally, we performed a standard 0.25-mg ACTH bolus stimulation test, with sampling at 1 h thereafter. Basal serum levels of DHEA, DS, and A4 were significantly reduced (approximately 50% each) in a group of 35 healthy postmenopausal women, 55-68 yr old, compared to those in 30 healthy, regularly menstruating women, 20-25 yr old. Post-DEX levels of these C19 steroids also were significantly lower in the older women than in the younger women; the percent decrease…
21769992	Functional and structural correlates of the aging brain: relating visual cortex (V1) gamma band responses to age-related structural change.	aging	2012-09-??	The gamma band response is thought to be a key neural signature of information processing in the mammalian brain, yet little is known about how age-related maturation influences the γ-band response. Recent MRI-based studies have shown that brain maturation is accompanied by clear structural changes in both gray and white matter, yet the correspondence of these changes to brain function is unclear. The objective of this study was to relate visual cortex (V1) γ-band responses to age-related structural change. We evaluated MEG measured γ-band responses to contrast gratings stimuli and structural MRIs from participants observed from two separate research centers (MEG lab at CUBRIC, Cardiff University, UK, and the Lurie Family Foundations MEG Imaging Center, (CHOP) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). Pooled participant data (N = 59) ranged in age from 8.7 to 45.3 years. We assessed linear associations between age and MEG γ-band frequency and amplitude, as well as between age and MR…
2298850	Production and metabolic clearance of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in men: effect of advancing age.	aging	1990-02-??	To determine whether aging alters the metabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] in men, we measured the serum concentrations, MCRs, and production rates of 1,25-(OH)2D in healthy old (age, 72 +/- 5 yr; n = 9) and young men (age, 34 +/- 5 yr; n = 9) consuming a constant metabolic diet and in whom the glomerular filtration rate was greater than 1.2 mL/s.1.73 m-2. The results indicate that when dietary calcium and phosphorus are normal and glomerular filtration rate is not reduced, the serum concentrations, MCRs, and production rates of 1,25-(OH)2D in old men [83 +/- 22 pmol/L; 0.62 +/- 0.10 mL/s.70 kg ideal BW (IBW); 51 +/- 12 fmol/s.70 kg IBW, respectively] and young men (90 +/- 20 pmol/L; 0.56 +/- 0.09 mL/s.70 kg IBW; 52 +/- 13 fmol/s.70 kg IBW, respectively) are equivalent. Indices of serum PTH, however, were elevated in the elderly men. These results suggest that aging per se has little or no effect on the serum concentration, MCR, or production rate of 1,25-(OH)2D in men. …
14671163	Ghrelin levels correlate with insulin levels, insulin resistance, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with gender, menopausal status, or cortisol levels in humans.	aging	2003-12-??	The gut peptide, ghrelin, may participate in the control of energy homeostasis and pituitary hormone secretion in humans, stimulating both food intake and, at pharmacological doses, ACTH and cortisol secretion. Meal consumption and weight loss regulate ghrelin levels, but less is known about the relationship of ghrelin to body composition, aging, menopausal status, and lipid metabolism. Therefore, 60 adult men and women of widely varying ages and weights were characterized in terms of body composition and levels of ghrelin, glucose, insulin, lipids, and cortisol. Fasting ghrelin levels correlated positively with age and negatively with BMI and fat cell size, but were not related to fat mass, intraabdominal fat, or lean mass. Fasting ghrelin levels correlated most strongly with insulin levels (r = -0.39; P = 0.002), insulin resistance as determined by the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (r = 0.38; P = 0.003), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.33; P = 0.…
15271723	Changes in thrombelastograph variables associated with aging.	aging	2004-08-??	Aging is associated with hypercoagulability. To assess thrombelastography (TEG) variables associated with aging, 132 adult patients of various ages undergoing orthopedic surgery for fracture repair had venous blood samples withdrawn for testing of recalcified TEG before the induction of anesthesia. Age was weakly correlated with all TEG variables: r time (R) (r = -0.45, P < 0.001; R = 19.5 - 0.09 x age), k time (K) (r = -0.49, P < 0.001; K = 6.5 - 0.04 x age), maximum amplitude (MA) (r = 0.25, P < 0.01; MA = 53.3 + 0.07 x age), and alpha (r = 0.52, P < 0.001; alpha = 52.8 + 0.2 x age). The correlation was stronger for men than for women. Only R was significantly correlated with age when the women were separately analyzed. Part of the correlation may be attributable to a concurrent decrease in hemoglobin with aging, but age remained an independent predictor of R, K, and alpha on forward stepwise linear multiple regression analysis. Aging was weakly associated with changes in TEG variabl…
24227680	Age-related changes of hyoid bone position in healthy older adults with aspiration.	aging	2014-06-??	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Aspiration, the passage of a bolus below the vocal folds, increases morbidity and mortality in the elderly by increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other conditions. We hypothesized that altered position of the hyoid bone associated with aging may negatively affect airway protection during swallowing (i.e., aspiration) in older adults.    STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.    METHODS: We re-reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans of the head from 40 older adults (65-80 years old), comprised of 20 aspirators and 20 nonaspirators, obtained from a previous cohort study. In addition, CT scans of the head from 40 young adults (20-40 years old) were retrieved from a medical records database. Three-dimensional reconstruction and 2-dimensional sagittal views were used to measure the distance between the mandible and hyoid bone. Comparisons between age groups, genders, and aspiration status were made.    RESULTS: Older adults had a larger distance between the hy…
11227736	Possibility of age regulation of the natriuretic peptide C-receptor in human platelets.	aging	2001-01-??	Natriuretic peptide binding sites on platelets have been hypothesized to act as clearance receptors; however, there is no clear definition of the function of this receptor. The aim of the study was: 1) to characterize natriuretic peptide receptors in human platelets by original competition study; 2) to evaluate a possible age modulation of these binding sites, since a delayed clearance of ANP in the elderly has been observed. The binding of 125I-ANP to intact platelets was completely inhibited by h-ANP, h-BNP, h-CNP and c-ANP, the selective ligand of the clearance receptor. IC50 values were 0.089+/-0.029, 0.703+/-0.104 and 1.19+/-0.13, 3.84+/-0.04 nmol/l, mean+/-SE, respectively (p<0.001 for IC50 value of h-ANP compared to the other natriuretic peptides). This observation on the receptor selectivity of natriuretic peptides in human platelets provides new evidence for the presence of the clearance receptor on platelets. In control subjects the Kd was 34.6+/-4.0 pmol/l and Bmax 13.6+/-0.…
23890349	Dietary protein intake is associated with lean body mass in community-dwelling older adults.	aging	2013-08-??	Lean body mass (LBM) is important to maintain physical function during aging. We hypothesized that dietary protein intake and leisure-time physical activity are associated with LBM in community-dwelling older adults. To test the hypothesis, participants (n = 237; age, 65-92 years) did 3-day weighed food records and reported physical activity. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Protein intake was 0.98 ± 0.28 and 0.95 ± 0.29 g/kg body weight in male and female participants, respectively. Protein intake (in grams per kilogram of body weight) was associated with LBM (in kilograms); that is, the differences in LBM were 2.3 kg (P < .05) and 2.0 kg (P = .054) between the fourth vs the first and the fourth vs the second quartiles of protein intake, respectively. Only a minor part of this association was explained by increased energy intake, which follows an increased protein intake. Our study shows that dietary protein intake was positively associated with LB…
26901223	Docosahexaenoic Acid and Cognition throughout the Lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2016-02-17	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the predominant omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in the brain and can affect neurological function by modulating signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, myelination, membrane receptor function, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, membrane integrity and membrane organization. DHA is rapidly accumulated in the brain during gestation and early infancy, and the availability of DHA via transfer from maternal stores impacts the degree of DHA incorporation into neural tissues. The consumption of DHA leads to many positive physiological and behavioral effects, including those on cognition. Advanced cognitive function is uniquely human, and the optimal development and aging of cognitive abilities has profound impacts on quality of life, productivity, and advancement of society in general. However, the modern diet typically lacks appreciable amounts of DHA. Therefore, in modern populations, maintaining optimal levels o…
3455620	Effect of age on circulating immunoreactive and bioactive parathyroid hormone levels in women.	aging	1987-10-??	Although levels of serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) increase with age in women, this could be caused by retention of non-biologically active PTH fragments by the aging kidney. In 102 normal women, aged 30 to 89 yr, serum iPTH increased with age by 58% (r = 0.33, p less than 0.001) with antiserum GP-1M (which has midmolecule specificity) and 43% (r = 0.32, p less than 0.001) with antiserum CH-12M (which may have whole molecule specificity); urinary cAMP/GFR excretion increased by 29% (r = 0.22, p less than 0.05). The results of these assays were validated by comparison with serum levels of biologically active PTH (BioPTH) in immunoextracts of serum followed by renal adenylate cyclase assay in a selected subgroup of 25 of the women. Serum BioPTH correlated with serum iPTH assessed by antiserum GP-1M (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) and antiserum CH-12M (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) but not with urinary cAMP. The data are consistent with an increase of parathyroid function with …
20456092	In vivo measurement of the water content in the dermis by confocal Raman spectroscopy.	aging	2010-05-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Dermal water plays an important role in the physical properties of the skin. Recently, researchers have attempted to directly measure the dermal water content in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging, near infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. However, these methods have limitations. Although confocal Raman spectroscopy has been developed to measure the water content in the skin, no reports have suggested that this instrument can measure the dermal water content. This report describes a method for measuring the dermal water content in vivo using confocal Raman spectroscopy.    METHODS: We used a confocal Raman spectrometer and adjusted the laser exposure time and depth increments according to the skin depth. Age-related changes in the dermal water content of the forearm were examined in 30 young and 30 elderly male subjects. Diurnal changes in the dermal water content of the forearm were examined in 12 elderly male subjects.    RESULTS: Adjusting the exposu…
2535364	DNA extraction from bloodstains in respect to age and stained substrate.	aging	1989-??-??	The amount and the quality of DNA that could be extracted from bloodstains equivalent to 200 microliters blood were examined after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 days of storage under dry or humid conditions at room temperature. DNA was also extracted from two days old 200 microliters bloodstains on different stain carriers. The amount of DNA that could be extracted showed a dependency on all the parameters that were examined. On carriers with a rough surface structure, where the blood can soak in, the resolving of leukocytes was impaired and the DNA recovery rate was low, e.g. carpeting and suede. The DNA yield was higher for substrates with a smooth surface, e.g. paper, glass and smooth leather. The aging experiments revealed that for the stains stored under dry conditions, there was no decrease in the DNA yield for stains on glass, while the amount of DNA that could be extracted became less for older stains on cotton. Under humid conditions the DNA yield was high and did not decrease fo…
3034809	Imipramine receptors in human platelets: effect of age.	aging	1987-??-??	Imipramine receptors were studied in platelets from six healthy young subjects (age between 24 and 38 years), five newborns, and six healthy elderly persons (age between 70 and 81 years). Binding parameters, the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) and the apparent dissociation constant (Kd), were determined by Scatchard's analysis. Level of differences between young subjects and the other groups was determined by Student's t-test. Bmax (mean +/- SD) was 1162 +/- 138 (young persons), 564 +/- 65 (newborn), and 508 +/- 98 (elderly persons) fmol/mg protein. The figure for the young was different from that of the newborn (p less than 0.001) and the elderly (p less than 0.01). Kd (means +/- SD) was 1.78 +/- .69 (young persons), 0.68 +/- 0.13 (newborn), and 0.80 +/- 0.27 nM in the elderly. Kd in the volunteers was different from that in the newborn or the elderly subjects (p less than 0.01). Imipramine receptors in platelets appear to be influenced by development and aging.
17478731	Direct evidence of endothelial oxidative stress with aging in humans: relation to impaired endothelium-dependent dilation and upregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB.	aging	2007-06-08	Aging is associated with impaired vascular endothelial function, as indicated in part by reduced endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). Decreased EDD with aging is thought to be related to vascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, but direct evidence is lacking. We studied 95 healthy men: 51 young (23+/-1 years) and 44 older (63+/-1 years). EDD (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) was approximately 50% lower in older versus young men (3.9+/-0.3% versus 7.6+/-0.3%, P<0.01; n=42 older/n=51 young). Abundance of nitrotyrosine (quantitative immunofluorescence), an oxidatively modified amino acid and marker of oxidative stress, was higher in endothelial cells (ECs) obtained from the brachial artery (1.25+/-0.12 versus 0.61+/-0.11 nitrotyrosine intensity/human umbilical vein EC [HUVEC] intensity, P=0.01; n=11 older/n=11 young) and antecubital veins (0.55+/-0.04 versus 0.34+/-0.03, P<0.05; n=19 older/n=17 young) of older men. Flow-mediated dilation was inversely related to arterial EC nit…
21164043	Changes in salivary amino acid composition during aging.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: it has been suggested that the features of saliva reflect the physiological and psychological state of primates as well as subprimates, however, studies revealing the relationship between aging and the concentrations of salivary amino acids are limited. In order to better understand their physiological role, age-related changes of salivary amino acids were investigated.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: forty-five participants including 5 children [6.60 ± 1.67 (5-9) years old], 20 adults [46.55 ± 14.68 (23-64) years old), and 20 senior citizens [71.60 ± 4.27 (66-82) years old] took part in this study. Whole saliva (one sample per each person) was collected in the daytime (10:00-11:00 or 14:00-15:00). Salivary amino acids were recovered after deproteinization with 5% trichloroacetic acid and determined by an amino acid analyzer.    RESULTS: glycine was the most abundant amino acid in the saliva. Glycine and lysine levels increased significantly (p<0.05) with aging, regardless of gen…
17951075	Gender differences and age-related white matter changes of the human brain: a diffusion tensor imaging study.	aging	2008-01-15	Cerebral white matter undergoes various changes with normal aging. This study investigated the association between age, gender, and the global and regional fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 145 adults (30 to 80 years old) using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. We studied sixteen regions of interest in both hemispheres to search for regions that display age- and gender-related white matter changes and also performed a complementary voxel-based analysis without any hypothesis a priori. On a global scale, our results indicate that the full brain FA was negatively correlated with age. The regional analysis showed that the anterior corpus callosum, the bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule, and the posterior periventricular regions had the most significant age-related FA decrease. On the other hand, the FA in the temporal and occipital regions was not correlated with age. However, in contrast to males, females overall had a significantly lower F…
30390247	Muscle Mass, Quality, and Composition Changes During Atrophy and Sarcopenia.	aging	????-??-??	Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and muscle strengh reach their peak in 20s to 40s of age in human life and then decrease with advancing age. The decrease rate of muscle strength or power was twice to four times as large as that of the SMM. Thus, the normalized muscle force (muscle strength divided by SMM) also decreases in aging. It depends on the number of factors in skeletal muscle tissues and neuromuscular system. In human study, SMM cannot be measured directly without dissection so that all of the methodologies are indirect methods to assess SMM, even computing tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, ultrasonography, anthropometry, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are used as secondary indirect methods to estimate SMM. Recent researches show muscle composition changes in aging, and in particular, the ratio of muscle cell mass (MCM) against SMM decrease and relative expansion of extracellular water (ECW) and extracellular space is observed wi…
24069317	MR volumetric study of piriform-cortical amygdala and orbitofrontal cortices: the aging effect.	aging	2013-??-??	INTRODUCTION: The piriform cortex and cortical amygdala (PCA) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are considered olfactory-related brain regions. This study aims to elucidate the normal volumes of PCA and OFC of each age groups (20.0-70.0 year old), and whether the volumes of PCA and OFC decline with increasing age and diminishing olfactory function.    METHODS: One hundred and eleven healthy right-handed participants (54 males, 57 females), age 20.0 to 70.0 years were recruited to join this study after excluding all the major causes of olfactory dysfunction. Volumetric measurements of PCA and OFC were performed using consecutive 1-mm thick coronal slices of high-resolution 3-D MRIs. A validated olfactory function test (Sniffin' Sticks) assessed olfactory function, which measured odor threshold (THD), odor discrimination (DIS), and odor identification (ID) as well as their sum score (TDI).    RESULTS: The volume of OFC decreased with age and significantly correlated with age-related dec…
2021131	Plasma amino acid concentrations in healthy elderly men and women.	aging	1991-05-??	Postabsorptive plasma concentrations of the large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) were measured in 74 elderly (age 71 +/- 8 y) and 138 young (age 26 +/- 5 y) healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of valine, leucine, and isoleucine were significantly lower in young females than in young males. This gender-related difference was not observed among elderly subjects because aging was associated with a significant rise in plasma LNAAs in females but not in males. Multiple-regression analysis of plasma amino acid concentrations from female subjects revealed a significant and positive effect of age on plasma valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine but not on plasma tryptophan or methionine. Tryptophan was the only amino acid to exhibit a significant response to age in males, consisting of a 14% decline in the elderly subjects. Percentile ranges are presented for young and elderly females and males for each of the amino acids.
22499763	Plasma beta amyloid level and depression in older adults.	aging	2013-01-??	BACKGROUND: Older adults with depression have an increased risk of developing dementia. Low plasma beta-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and Aβ42/Aβ40 have emerged as promising biomarkers of dementia. The association between depression and plasma Aβ is unclear.    METHODS: In this longitudinal study of 988 community-dwelling elders from the Health Aging and Body Composition study, depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale 10-item version. We determined the association between Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 tertile and depression at baseline and over 9 years. We also stratified the models to determine if apolipoprotein E e4 allele status modified the associations.    RESULTS: Mean baseline age was 74.0 ± 3.0 years, 51 (5.2%) participants had depression, 545 (55.2%) were women, 531 (53.7%) were black, and 286 (30.7%) had one or more apolipoprotein E e4 allele. At baseline, there was no association between Aβ42/Aβ40 or Aβ42 and depression. Over 9 years, 220 (23.5%) participa…
312834	Subpopulations of human T lymphocytes. X. Alterations in T, B, third population cells, and T cells with receptors for immunoglobulin M (Tmu) or G (Tgamma) in aging humans.	aging	1979-04-??	Peripheral blood from 120 healthy subjects, of whom 59 were young (35.5 +/- 9.6 years) and 61 aging (69.2 +/- 4.2 years), was examined for the proportions and numbers of lymphocyte populations, with a battery of surface markers. Absolute lymphocyte count and T,B and third population cells were comparable in both groups. Tgamma cell proportions were significantly (p less than 0.001) increased in aging subjects when compared with the young subjects. However, this difference was more significant (p less than 0.001) when aged females were compared with the young females as compared to aged males vs young males (p less than 0.05). When data were anlayzed for absolute numbers of Tmu and Tgamma cells, a similar significant decrease in Tmu, and increase in Tgamma cells were observed. Interestingly, when these data were anlayzed according to gender, significant differences in Tmu and Tgamma cell number were observed between young and old females but not between young and old men. Implications o…
19699215	The relationship between episodic long-term memory and white matter integrity in normal aging.	aging	2010-01-??	It has been proposed that episodic long-term memory (LTM) declines in normal aging and may be affected by disruption of white matter networks. This was explored in 104 healthy adults aged 50-90 years in the GENIE study; white matter integrity was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in large regions of interest, with additional measures of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), normalized brain and hippocampal volumes. LTM was compared with executive function, working memory and information processing speed. LTM correlated significantly with DTI, WMH and whole brain volume, but not with hippocampal volume. Using linear regression, only DTI measures explained the variance (approximately 19%) in LTM; mediational analyses explored the extent to which other cognitive functions mediate the association between DTI changes and memory. The results suggest that reduced LTM performance in normal aging is related to reduced integrity of a distributed network dependent on white matter pathw…
8144824	Seven consecutive days of exercise lowers plasma insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge in sedentary elderly.	aging	1994-04-??	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of 1 and 7 consecutive days of exercise on glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.    DESIGN: Intervention group assessed at baseline and after 1 and 7 days of exercise.    SETTING: Academic medical institution.    PARTICIPANTS: Nine healthy 60 to 80-year-old men and women.    INTERVENTION: Seven days of 50 minutes of exercise at 70% VO2 max.    MEASUREMENTS: Body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin levels and responses to an oral glucose challenge at baseline and after 1 and 7 days of exercise.    MAIN RESULTS: Fasting plasma insulin levels and plasma insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge were reduced by 15% and 20%, respectively, with 7 consecutive days of exercise that resulted in no change in body weight or body composition. No changes in glucose or insulin levels or responses to the oral glucose challenge were evident after a single day of exercise.    CONCLUSION: The hyperinsulinemia associated with aging…
21929288	Cell signaling and receptors in toxicity of advanced glycation end products (AGEs): α-dicarbonyls, radicals, oxidative stress and antioxidants.	aging	2011-10-??	Considerable attention has been paid to the toxicity of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), including relation to various illnesses. AGEs, generated nonenzymatically from carbohydrates and proteins, comprises large numbers of simple and more complicated compounds. Many reports deal with a role for receptors (RAGE) and cell signaling, including illnesses and aging. Reactive oxygen species appear to participate in signaling. RAGE include angiotensin II type 1 receptors. Many signaling pathways are involved, such as kinases, p38, p21, TGF-β, NF-κβ, TNF-α, JNK and STAT. A recent review puts focus on α-dicarbonyl metabolites, formed by carbohydrate oxidation, and imine derivatives from protein condensation, as a source via electron transfer (ET) of ROS and oxidative stress (OS). The toxic species have been related to illnesses and aging. Antioxidants alleviate the adverse effects.
8143888	Accumulation of new quinolones in the blood of elderly patients.	aging	????-??-??	The correlation between serum levels of five new quinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin), age and 24 h creatinine clearance was studied in 180 patients. One of five new quinolones was orally administered, before transurethral resection of the prostate, at the dosage of 200 mg three times daily for 3 consecutive days. Serum levels were checked 5.5 h or about 17 h after the final administration. Creatinine clearance was found to be negatively correlated with aging (P < 0.001). After oral administration, the level of certain accumulated new quinolones in serum increased with the age of patients (P < 0.001-0.1). This tendency was more marked for ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and enoxacin than for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The investigators concluded that the level of accumulated new quinolones in serum with aging is correlated to the 24 h urinary excretion rate of each new quinolone. These results indicate that ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and enoxacin, whic…
12818346	Macular pigment density and distribution: comparison of fundus autofluorescence with minimum motion photometry.	aging	2003-07-??	Macular pigment (MP) distribution profiles were measured for 18 subjects using a Moreland anomaloscope modified for motion photometry. The total amount of MP within the central 7 degrees was estimated from the distribution profile by numerical integration. Fundus autofluorescence images were obtained for eight of these subjects using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Peak optical density of MP increased with the total amount present, but the correlation was weakened by inter-subject differences in MP distribution. The mean MP distribution derived from mean grey-scale profiles of fundus autofluorescence images correlated closely with that obtained psychophysically (r=0.96). Autofluorescence imaging provides a fast non-invasive method for assessing MP in vivo.
9284734	Endogenous glucose production following injury increases with age.	aging	1997-09-??	To evaluate the influence of aging on the increase in endogenous glucose production that follows injury, we studied 22 fully resuscitated, clinically stable, previously healthy patients aged < or = 30 yr or > or = 60 yr admitted to hospital following injury, and 11 healthy volunteers in the same age groups. Endogenous glucose production was determined using a primed constant infusion of D-glucose-6,6-2d2. Urine cortisol and C-peptide were markedly higher in patients than volunteers (both P < 0.01), and urine C-peptide was lower in older than in younger patients (P < 0.05). Urine cortisol increased as a function of the interaction of age and Injury Severity Score (ISS) (r2 = 0.40, P < 0.001). Intracellular water was markedly lower and extracellular water greater in patients compared with volunteers (both P < 0.001), reflecting the loss of body cell mass and expansion of the extracellular space following injury. Endogenous glucose production (milligrams per minute per liter intracellular…
25691285	Effect of retinoic acid and vitamin D3 on osteoblast differentiation and activity in aging.	aging	2016-01-??	Several studies have evidenced that in aging, osteoblast functional activity is impaired: osteoblast proliferation is slower and matrix deposition is less efficient. Because peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and fatty acids are important inhibitory signals in osteoblast development, we have investigated in human primary osteoblasts obtained from patients of different ages, the influence of retinoic acid and calcitriol on enzymes involved in differentiative (PPARγ2, β-catenin, and insulin-like growth factor 1) and metabolic (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) intracellular pathways, and on transglutaminase 2, as enzyme fundamental for stabilizing the newly deposited extracellular matrix in bone. Retinoic acid and calcitriol influenced, respectively, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, and an increase in PPARγ2 expression was observed following retinoic acid administration, whereas a decrease was observed following calcitriol administration. Aging widely…
20865313	Neurocognitive consequences of HIV infection in older adults: an evaluation of the "cortical" hypothesis.	aging	2011-08-??	The incidence and prevalence of older adults living with HIV infection is increasing. Recent reports of increased neuropathologic and metabolic alterations in older HIV+ samples, including increased cortical beta-amyloid, have led some researchers to suggest that aging with HIV may produce a neuropsychological profile akin to that which is observed in "cortical" dementias (e.g., impairment in memory consolidation). To evaluate this possibility, we examined four groups classified by HIV serostatus and age (i.e., younger ≤40 years and older ≥50 years): (1) Younger HIV- (n = 24); (2) Younger HIV+ (n = 24); (3) Older HIV- (n = 20); and (4) Older HIV+ (n = 48). Main effects of aging were observed on episodic learning and memory, executive functions, and visuoconstruction, and main effects of HIV were observed on measures of verbal learning and memory. The interaction of age and HIV was observed on a measure of verbal recognition memory, which post hoc analyses showed to be exclusively attri…
23873965	Markers of human skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control: effects of age and aerobic exercise training.	aging	2014-04-??	Perturbations in mitochondrial health may foster age-related losses of aerobic capacity (VO2peak) and skeletal muscle size. However, limited data exist regarding mitochondrial dynamics in aging human skeletal muscle and the influence of exercise. The purpose of this study was to examine proteins regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, VO2peak, and skeletal muscle size before and after aerobic exercise training in young men (20 ± 1 y) and older men (74 ± 3 y). Exercise-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurred independent of age, whereas the improvement in VO2peak was more pronounced in young men. Aerobic exercise training increased proteins involved with mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, and fission, independent of age. This is the first study to examine pathways of mitochondrial quality control in aging human skeletal muscle with aerobic exercise training. These data indicate normal aging does not influence proteins associated with mitochondrial health or the ability to r…
15670619	Anti-oxidant gene expression imbalance, aging and Down syndrome.	aging	2005-02-04	The expression of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) genes have been detected in human skin fibroblast cells for 2 year normal child (control), 50 year old normal male and female and a 1 year old Down Syndrome (DS) male and female with established trisomy karyotype using the RT-PCR technique. Differential expression of these genes is quantified individually against a beta-Actin gene that has been employed as an internal control. The immunoblotting of cell lysate proteins with polyclonal antibodies exhibit SOD1 (16 kD), SOD2 (40 kD), GPx (23 and 92 kD), CAT (64 kD), and Actin (43 kD) as translational products. The results demonstrate that the enhancement in the level of mRNAs encoding SOD1 in DS male and female, as well as aged male and female are 51, 21, 31 and 50% respectively compared to the normal child (control). In SOD2, DS male and female display higher (176%) and lower (26%) levels of e…
11830354	Telomere shortening with aging in human thyroid and parathyroid tissue.	aging	2002-04-??	Progressive telomere shortening with aging was studied using normal thyroid tissue specimens from 46 human subjects aged between 0 and 98 yr and normal parathyroid tissue specimens from 21 human subjects aged between 0 and 83 yrs. There has hitherto been no information documented about telomere length in such thyroid and parathyroid tissues. Age-related shortening at rates of 91 and 92 base pairs (bp) per year, respectively, were observed. Telomere lengths of normal thyroid tissues were 16.53 +/- 1.10 (mean +/- SE), 14.31 +/- 0.80, 11.27 +/- 0.68 and 8.73 +/- 1.08 kbp for age groups less than 2, 20-50, 51-80 and more than 80 yr. Telomere lengths of normal parathyroid tissues were 15.80 +/- 1.46 (mean +/- SE), 15.36 +/- 0.86 and 10.93 +/- 0.78 kbp for age groups less than 4, 20-50 and 51-80 yr. Telomere shortening occurred after 50 yr of age in thyroid and parathyroid tissues. Human thyroid and parathyroid tissues do not seem to show the rapid reduction in telomere length early in life …
11870011	Low testosterone levels in elderly men with dysthymic disorder.	aging	2002-03-??	OBJECTIVE: A decline in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis function is often seen in elderly men, and dysthymic disorder is common. Symptoms of both HPG axis hypofunction and dysthymic disorder include dysphoria, fatigue, and low libido. The authors compared total testosterone levels in three groups of elderly men.    METHOD: Total testosterone levels were measured in subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (N=13) or dysthymic disorder (N=32) and a comparison group (N=175) who had participated in an epidemiological study of male aging and had scored below the median on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, a well-validated, self-report depression symptom inventory.    RESULTS: There were no differences among the three groups in measured demographic variables, including age and weight. Median testosterone levels varied for those with dysthymic disorder (295 ng/dl), major depressive disorder (425 ng/dl), and no depression (423 ng/dl). A test…
7925749	Changes of ovarian hormonal function with aging.	aging	????-??-??	Striking changes of ovarian function occur with aging. These changes begin subtly with reductions of fecundability being observed after age 25. The transition from reproductive to postreproductive life is characterized by menstrual irregularity including anovulation, or short luteal phases. The most prominent hormonal changes at the menopause are drastic reductions of estradiol and progesterone secretion by the ovary, reflecting the cessation of folliculogenesis and ovulation. Elevations of gonadotropins and reduction of inhibin levels also reflect the loss of folliculogenesis and ovulation. There are accompanying decreases of ovarian androgen secretion; however, the postmenopausal gonad directly secretes more testosterone after, than before, the menopause.
15748785	Age-related metabolic changes in the upper brainstem tegmentum by MR spectroscopy.	aging	2005-07-??	Several neurodegenerative disorders have a profound metabolic and structural impact on the brainstem. MR spectroscopy provides metabolic information non-invasively and has the potential to characterize the changes associated with normal aging and differentiate them from neurodegenerative alterations. The present work was aimed at studying the upper brainstem tegmentum at the midbrain and pontine levels in 57 adult normal volunteers, aged 23-79 years, with long-echo time proton MR spectroscopy to evaluate possible regional differences and the effect of age. Higher ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/total creatine (Cr) and choline-containing compounds (Cho)/Cr were observed in the pons compared to the midbrain, resulting from higher net NAA and Cho content. In the midbrain, there was a linear decline of NAA and Cho with age in subjects over 50, most probably related to neuronal tissue loss. In the pons, such an aging effect was not observed, with subjects over 50 showing higher Cr and Ch…
27447627	Inflammaging and Frailty Status Do Not Result in an Increased Extracellular Vesicle Concentration in Circulation.	aging	2016-07-20	In the last decades extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key players for intercellular communication. In the case of inflammation, several studies have reported that EV levels are increased in circulation during inflammatory episodes. Based on this, we investigated whether aging results in elevated EV number, as a basal proinflammatory status termed "inflammaging" has been described in aged individuals. Moreover, we also hypothesized that frailty and dependence conditions of the elderly could affect EV concentration in plasma. Results showed that inflammaging, frailty or dependence status do not result in EV increase, at least in the total number of EVs in circulation. These results open a new perspective for investigating the role of EVs in human aging and in the inflammaging process.
8622788	Influence of aging on the seasonal rhythm of the vasopressin-expressing neurons in the human suprachiasmatic nucleus.	aging	????-??-??	The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is considered to be a major component of the biological clock implicated in the temporal organization of a variety of physiological, endocrine, and behavioral processes. There is now a great deal of evidence indicating that many of these rhythms are progressively disturbed during senescence. The present study was aimed at investigating the influence of aging on the seasonal rhythm of the vasopressin (VP)-expressing neurons in the human SCN. To that end, brains obtained at autopsy of 48 human subjects, ranging in age from 6 to 91 years, were studied. Subjects were divided into two age groups, viz. "young subjects" (up to 50 years) and "elderly subjects" (over 50 years). It is shown that the number of VP-immunoreactive neurons in the human SCN exhibits a marked annual oscillation in young but not in elderly people. Whereas in young subjects low VP-immunoreactive neuron numbers were found during the summer (May-July) and peak values in autumn (S…
27583846	Using optical coherence tomography to assess the role of age and region in corneal epithelium and palisades of vogt.	aging	2016-08-??	Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to observe the morphology and epithelial thickness (ET) of the palisades of Vogt (POV), and to evaluate the role of age and region on these structures.One hundred twelve eyes of 112 healthy subjects were enrolled and divided into 4 groups: A (0-19), B (20-39), C (40-59), and D (≥60 years old). RTvue-100 OCT was applied on the cornea and the limbus. The morphology of the subepithelial stroma underneath the epithelium of POV was classified into typical and atypical types. Maximum ET of POV was measured manually from OCT images.The positive rate of typical POV in superior, nasal, temporal, and inferior limbus was: Group A: 100%, 69.2%, 65.4%, 100%; Group B: 100%, 73.5%, 61.8%, 94.1%; Group C: 95.8%, 41.7%, 37.5%, 83.3%; Group D: 67.9%, 0%, 3.6%, 25%, showing a significant decreasing tendency with age. The maximum ET of POV in superior, nasal, temporal, and inferior limbus was: Group A: 103.5 ± 10.1 um, 89.2 ± 9.7 um, 87.9 ± 13.6 um,…
12454908	Efficient principal component analysis for multivariate 3D voxel-based mapping of brain functional imaging data sets as applied to FDG-PET and normal aging.	aging	2003-01-??	Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-known technique for reduction of dimensionality of functional imaging data. PCA can be looked at as the projection of the original images onto a new orthogonal coordinate system with lower dimensions. The new axes explain the variance in the images in decreasing order of importance, showing correlations between brain regions. We used an efficient, stable and analytical method to work out the PCA of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of 74 normal subjects using [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as a tracer. Principal components (PCs) and their relation to age effects were investigated. Correlations between the projections of the images on the new axes and the age of the subjects were carried out. The first two PCs could be identified as being the only PCs significantly correlated to age. The first principal component, which explained 10% of the data set variance, was reduced only in subjects of age 55 or older and was related to lo…
30004553	The gut microbiota urolithin metabotypes revisited: the human metabolism of ellagic acid is mainly determined by aging.	aging	2018-08-15	Understanding individuals' response to dietary bioactives is crucial for personalized nutrition. We report here for the first time in a Caucasian cohort (5-90 years, n = 839) that aging is the main factor that determines the gut microbiota involved in the ellagic acid-ellagitannin metabolism (urolithin metabotypes), with potential consequences for human health.
19276848	Biomechanical and skeletal muscle determinants of maximum running speed with aging.	aging	2009-04-??	PURPOSE: Aging diminishes the ability to run fast, but the specific mechanisms responsible for this deterioration remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the age-related decline in sprint running ability through a cross-sectional examination of biomechanical and skeletal muscle characteristics in 77 competitive male sprinters aged 17-82 yr.    METHODS: Ground reaction force (GRF) and kinematic stride cycle parameters were measured during the maximum-velocity phase using a 9.4-m-long force platform. Knee extensor (KE) and ankle plantar flexor (PF) structural characteristics were investigated using ultrasonography and muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis). Force production characteristics of leg extensor muscles were determined by dynamic and isometric contractions.    RESULTS: The main findings were as follows: 1) the progressive age-related decline in maximum running velocity (Vmax) was mainly related to a reduction in stride length (Lstr) and an increase in ground c…
11377922	Neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(2) receptor mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of psychiatric subjects. Relationship of Y(2) subtype to suicidal behavior.	aging	2001-07-??	It has been hypothesized that the neuropeptide Y (NPY) system is involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorder. In this study, Y(1) and Y(2) receptor mRNA expression levels were analyzed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects affected with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia and compared to normal controls. No significant alterations in Y(1) or Y(2) mRNA expression levels were observed between the groups. However, the Y(2) mRNA expression was elevated in layer IV in subjects with suicide as a cause of death. For the Y(1) mRNA expression, there was a negative correlation with increasing subject age in the prefrontal cortex. Analysis of covariance revealed a significant elevation of the Y(1) mRNA expression levels in individuals with a current history of marijuana use but no other drug. In summary, the current results suggest distinct alterations of the prefrontal Y(1) and Y(2) neuronal populations in aging and suicide.
6801960	Detection of protein-calorie malnutrition in the elderly.	aging	1982-02-??	The geriatric population is an ever-increasing segment of our society. A careful review of the physical, anatomic, and biochemical changes which occur with aging indicates that measurements traditionally made to detect the presence of protein-calorie malnutrition may be inappropriate for the elderly due to a lack of specific norms for comparison. Changes that are normally seen with age may appear to be representative of a nutritional deficit if the observer is unfamiliar with the aging process. Methods of extrapolating existing nutritional assessment data for use in the geriatric population, development of norms specific for the aged, and study of nontraditional methods of evaluation should all be considered in an effort to improve nutritional assessment techniques for this population.
11431454	Age-related accumulation and spatial distribution of lipofuscin in RPE of normal subjects.	aging	2001-07-??	PURPOSE: To characterize the age-related accumulation of lipofuscin in a population of normal subjects, resolve differences in estimated accumulation rates obtained in previous studies, and characterize the spatial distribution of lipofuscin in the normal fundus.    METHODS: Spectrophotometric measurements were made at the fovea and 7 degrees temporal to the fovea in 145 normal subjects (age range, 15-80 years). Spatial distribution along the four cardinal meridians was measured in selected subjects by both spectrophotometry and autofluorescence imaging. To minimize contributions of extraneous fluorophores, macular pigment, and melanin, all measurements used excitation at 550 nm, integrating emission between 650 and 750 nm.    RESULTS: Lipofuscin fluorescence increased linearly until age 70, then declined. The rate of accumulation was significantly slower in the fovea than at the temporal site; accumulation rates in vivo were greater than previously observed in microscopic studies. Flu…

In an attempt to examine the effect of prolonged physical activity on the function of the GH/IGF-1 axis during the aging process in man, we have evaluated basal and GHRH (GHRH-29: 1 microgram/kg i.v. as a bolus) stimulated GH secretion as well as basal plasma IGF-1 levels in a group of 25 healthy runners (50-60 years, mean age 55.5 +/- 0.6) and 24 age-matched relatively sedentary normal controls (mean age 55.8 +/- 0.7). The runners had a minimum distance in kilometers of 26 km/week for at least 15 years, and competed in distances ranging from 16 km to the marathon. In runners, GHRH induced an increase of GH which was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that observed in the age-matched controls. Baseline IGF-1 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in trained runners (171 +/- 8.4 micrograms/1) compared to the controls (91.1 +/- 5.5 micrograms/1). These data show that in middle-age prolonged physical activity increases the function of the GH/IGF-1 axis. To clarify the possible me…
23334084	Longitudinal elastic properties and porosity of cortical bone tissue vary with age in human proximal femur.	aging	2013-04-??	Tissue level structural and mechanical properties are important determinants of bone strength. As an individual ages, microstructural changes occur in bone, e.g., trabeculae and cortex become thinner and porosity increases. However, it is not known how the elastic properties of bone change during aging. Bone tissue may lose its elasticity and become more brittle and prone to fractures as it ages. In the present study the age-dependent variation in the spatial distributions of microstructural and microelastic properties of the human femoral neck and shaft were evaluated by using acoustic microscopy. Although these properties may not be directly measured in vivo, there is a major interest to investigate their relationships with the linear elastic measurements obtained by diagnostic ultrasound at the most severe fracture sites, e.g., the femoral neck. However, before the validity of novel in vivo techniques can be established, it is essential to understand the age-dependent variation in t…
15472218	Role of sympathetic neural activation in age- and habitual exercise-related differences in the thermic effect of food.	aging	2004-10-??	The thermic effect of food (TEF) declines with advancing age in adult humans but is enhanced in the habitually exercising state. The responsiveness of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has been implicated in these differences in TEF. We tested the hypotheses that 1) the reduction in TEF with aging is associated with an attenuated SNS response to acute energy intake; and 2) the greater TEF observed in endurance exercise-trained adults is associated with an augmented SNS response. Four groups of healthy men were studied: 16 young and 11 older sedentary men and nine young and 10 older habitually exercising men. Metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry, ventilated hood), skeletal muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; peroneal microneurography), and plasma norepinephrine and plasma epinephrine concentrations were measured before and for up to 4 h after ingestion of a carbohydrate drink (2.5 g/kg fat-free mass). TEF was approximately 50% greater in young compared with older men (P < 0.05) …
17002558	On the increasing fragility of human teeth with age: a deep-UV resonance Raman study.	aging	2006-12-??	UNLABELLED: UV resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) using 244-nm excitation was used to study the impact of aging on human dentin. The intensity of a spectroscopic feature from the peptide bonds in the collagen increases with tissue age, similar to a finding reported previously for human cortical bone.    INTRODUCTION: The structural changes that lead to compromised mechanical properties with age in dentin and bone are under intense study. However, in situ analyses of the content and distribution of the mineral phase are more highly developed at present than equivalent probes of the organic phase.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five human molars were divided into three groups: young/normal (23.3 +/- 3.8 years); aged/transparent (74.3 +/- 6.0 years), which had become transparent because of filling of the tubule lumens with mineral deposits; and aged/nontransparent (73.3 +/- 5.7 years). Control experiments were performed by demineralizing normal dentin.    RESULTS: Spectral features ca…
12548289	Mapping cortical change across the human life span.	aging	2003-03-??	We used magnetic resonance imaging and cortical matching algorithms to map gray matter density (GMD) in 176 normal individuals ranging in age from 7 to 87 years. We found a significant, nonlinear decline in GMD with age, which was most rapid between 7 and about 60 years, over dorsal frontal and parietal association cortices on both the lateral and interhemispheric surfaces. Age effects were inverted in the left posterior temporal region, where GMD gain continued up to age 30 and then rapidly declined. The trajectory of maturational and aging effects varied considerably over the cortex. Visual, auditory and limbic cortices, which are known to myelinate early, showed a more linear pattern of aging than the frontal and parietal neocortices, which continue myelination into adulthood. Our findings also indicate that the posterior temporal cortices, primarily in the left hemisphere, which typically support language functions, have a more protracted course of maturation than any other cortica…
15962837	Senile seminal vesicle amyloid is derived from semenogelin I.	aging	2005-04-??	Senile seminal vesicle amyloid (SSVA), one of the most common forms of localized amyloidosis, is associated with the male aging process. Although it had been posited that the amyloidogenic component originated from exocrine cells and that, on the basis of immunohistochemistry, that the amyloid was composed of lactoferrin, the nature of SSVA was never established definitively. To address this issue, we have used our microanalytic techniques to characterize the structure of the congophilic green birefringent protein extracted from 5 such amyloid-containing specimens. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that in all cases, the fibrils were composed mainly of polypeptide fragments identical in sequence to the N-terminal portion of the major secretory product of seminal vesicles, namely semenogelin I (SgI). Although lactoferrin was detected in 3 instances, the trace amount and seemingly intact form of this molecule indicated that it was not the amyloidogenic molecule. The SgI nature of the …
16625938	Physiological reactivity to cognitive stressors: variations by age and socioeconomic status.	aging	2006-??-??	The present study focused on age and SES differences in stress reactivity in response to cognitively challenging tasks. Specifically, we assessed within-person trajectories of cortisol, a steroid hormone released by the adrenal gland in response to stressors, before, during, and after exposure to cognitively challenging tasks. We extend the current literature by simultaneously examining age and SES differences in physiological reactivity. Findings suggest that age and SES both play an important role in reactivity, such that it was the older adults with higher SES who were the most physiologically reactive to cognitive stressors. Implications of these findings for cognitive aging research are discussed.
3181333	Age-related increase in concentration and aggregation of degraded polypeptides in human lenses.	aging	1988-10-??	Proteins from human lenses of various ages were separated into three fractions based on their solubility; water-soluble (WS), water-insoluble-urea-soluble (WI-US) and water-insoluble-urea-insoluble (WI-UI). The SDS-PAGE of these fractions showed increasing quantities of degraded polypeptides (mol. wt; Mr less than 18 kDa) with aging. On separation of degraded polypeptides from the rest of lens crystallins by gel-filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions, the polypeptides showed an age-related concentration increase in the WS and WI-US fractions, which constituted 12-14% and 17-18% of the total proteins respectively. The degraded polypeptides from WI-US fractions of lenses from 50-yr-old donors exhibited five polypeptides ranging in Mr between 3- and 18 kDa. The degraded polypeptides isolated from WS and WI-US fractions of lenses of various ages self-aggregated on storage to protein moieties with Mr ranging between 18- and greater than 1500 kDa. An antiserum was raised again…
22938712	Biosynthetic pathway to neuromelanin and its aging process.	aging	2012-11-??	Using model compounds of the melanic component of neuromelanin (NM) prepared by tyrosinase oxidation at various ratios of dopamine (DA) and cysteine (Cys) under physiological conditions, we examined a biosynthetic pathway to NM and its aging process by following the time course of oxidation to NM and the subsequent structural modification of NM under various heating conditions. Chemical degradation methods were applied to the synthetic NM. 4-Amino-3-hydroxyphenylethylamine (4-AHPEA) and thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid (TTCA) were used as markers of benzothiazine and benzothiazole units, respectively. By following the time course of the biosynthetic pathway of synthetic NM, we found that neurotoxic molecules are trapped in NM. An aging simulation of synthetic NM showed that benzothiazine units in NM are gradually converted to benzothiazole during the aging process. Thus, natural NM was found to be similar to aged (heated) NM prepared from a 2:1 molar ratio of DA and Cys.
3703758	Trace elements in nutrition of the elderly. 1. Established RDAs for iron, zinc, and iodine.	aging	1986-05-01	Trace elements play a poorly understood role in human metabolism and nutrition. In the elderly, the normal effects of aging further complicate an understanding of trace element nutriture. The RDA standards established to date for the elderly have important limitations in that "healthy" persons 51 years of age and older constitute a single, regrettably imprecise category. Although any minor elemental constituent of the body is considered to be a trace element, only 16 are currently believed to be of biologic importance to humans. A recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established for only three of these--iron, zinc, and iodine.
25746208	Poor levels of agreement between serum and saliva testosterone measurement following exercise training in aging men.	aging	2015-06-??	Testosterone (T) is a biologically important androgen that demonstrates a widely-known natural decline with advancing age. The use of salivary T (sal-T), as a determinant of systemic T, has shown promising results in recent years. However, the strength of the salivary-serum T relationship may be affected by measurement method and binding capacity with salivary proteins. The potential influence exercise may impact on this relationship is unstudied in aging men. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to examine the relationship of the delta change (Δ) in sal-T with Δserum T following six weeks exercise training. Fifteen sedentary (SED) males (aged 60.4 ± 5.0 years of age) and 20 lifelong exercising (LE) males (60.4 ± 4.7 years of age) were participated. Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed sal-T did not correlate with total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), bioactive T (bio-T), or free T (free-T) at week 0 or week 6. Δsal-T did not correlate with …
25660207	The impact of executive capacity and age on mechanisms underlying multidimensional feature selection.	lifespan, aging	2015-04-??	This study examined the role of executive capacity (EC) and aging in multidimensional feature selection. ERPs were recorded from healthy young and old adults of either high or average EC based on neuropsychological testing. Participants completed a color selective attention task in which they responded to target letter-forms in a specified color (attend condition) while ignoring letter-forms in a different color (ignore condition). Two selection negativity (SN) components were computed: the SN(Color) (attend-ignore), indexing early color selection, and the SN(Letter) (targets-standards), indexing early letter-form selection. High EC subjects exhibited self-terminating feature selection; the processing of one feature type was reduced if information from the other feature type suggested the stimulus did not contain the task-relevant feature. In contrast, average EC subjects exhaustively selected all features of a stimulus. The self-terminating approach was associated with better task acc…
11211954	Age-related modifications in human unstimulated whole saliva: a biochemical study.	aging	2000-12-??	Human whole saliva contains a number of antimicrobial agents, and lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory IgA and peroxidase are among the best known. Peroxidase catalyzes a reaction involved in the inhibition of bacterial growth and metabolism, and the prevention of hydrogen peroxide accumulation, thus protecting proteins from the action of oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To better understand the role played by the oxidative stress in the aging process, we studied the relationship between total protein content, peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) content of human unstimulated whole saliva in 169 healthy subjects subdivided into groups according to age. Our results show a significant decrease in peroxidase activity with age. Moreover, the increase in saliva lipid peroxide levels indicates an enhanced free radical production that may contribute to tissue damage. On the other hand, findings concerning human unstimulated whole saliva NO content showed a sig…
26468005	Inverse relationship of Rho kinase and myosin-light chain kinase expression in the aging human detrusor smooth muscle.	aging	2015-10-15	BACKGROUND: Rho kinase (ROCK) and myosin-light chain kinase (MLCK) are key enzymes in smooth muscle contraction. Previous data have suggested that ROCK contribution to human detrusor contraction is increasing with age. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptional expression of Rho kinase isoforms (ROCK1 and ROCK2) as well as MLCK in the aging human detrusor smooth muscle obtained from resected tissue.    METHODS: Small pieces of macroscopically healthy human detrusor smooth muscle (urothelium-free) were prepared for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Transcript expression (mRNA level) of the target genes ROCK1, ROCK2 and MLCK was normalized to three common reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β-actin, phosphoglycerate kinase 1).    RESULTS: We found that across all ages the expression level of ROCK (i.e. ROCK1 and ROCK2 together) was almost equal to that of MLCK in the human bladder. Further, ROCK2 showed a significantly…
10089218	Influence of skeletal site of origin and donor age on osteoblastic cell growth and differentiation.	aging	1999-04-??	Bone loss with aging may be due, at least in part, to inadequate bone formation. Moreover, the process of bone aging is known to follow a different pattern throughout the skeleton. In this study, we examined the cell proliferation rate (area under the cell growth curve, AUC) and the secretion of C-terminal type I procollagen (PICP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OC) in primary cultures of osteoblastic cells from human trabecular bone. Osteoblastic cells were obtained for 168 donors (100 women and 68 men). Ninety-eight bone samples were obtained from subjects undergoing knee arthroplastia, 52 aged 50-70 years (64 +/- 5) and 46 over age 70 (73 +/- 2). Another 70 bone samples were obtained from subjects undergoing hip arthroplastia; 51 were 50-70 years old (64 +/- 4) and 19 were over 70 (75 +/- 5). Osteoblastic cells from the older donors had a lower proliferation rate and OC secretion than those from younger subjects. However, ALP secretion was higher in the former subject…
8963671	Age-dependent increases in protein kinase C-alpha beta immunoreactivity and activity in the human brain: possible in vivo modulatory effects on guanine nucleotide regulatory G(i) proteins.	aging	1996-02-26	In the postmortem human brain (20 specimens of frontal cortex, Brodmann area 9) the abundance of immunoreactive protein kinase C (PKC-alpha beta) and the activity of PKC (calcium, phosphatidylserine, and phorbol ester-dependent enzymes) were determined to study the effect of aging (range 1 month to 89 years) on this regulatory enzyme. Also, the abundance of immunoreactive G protein subunits (G alpha i1/2, G alpha i3, G alpha o, G alpha s and G beta) were assessed in parallel to investigate possible relationships with PKC-alpha beta. The abundance of PKC-alpha beta was positively correlated with aging (r = 0.62, n = 20, P < 0.005). Moreover, PKC activity also showed a significant positive correlation with the age of the subject at death (r = 0.55, n = 14, P < 0.05). Because of the known in vitro modulatory role of PKC-alpha beta on G(i) proteins, the existence of an in vivo effect of brain PKC-alpha beta on various G proteins was assessed through correlation analyses. In the brain of th…
17525986	Hemodynamic response to visual stimulation in newborn infants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.	aging	2008-04-??	Brain activity is associated with physiological changes, which alter the optical properties of tissue. These changes can be detected by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Aim of the study was to determine changes in cerebral oxygenation in response to stimulation in the visual cortex in newborn infants during spontaneous sleep in the first days of life. We used an in-house developed multichannel NIRS imaging instrument, the MCP-II, to measure changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) in specific brain areas. In 10 out of 15 subjects, a significant increase in O(2)Hb and/or a significant decrease in HHb were found in one or more channels over the occipital cortex. During stimulation, O(2)Hb increased by a mean of 0.98 mumol/l, HHb decreased by a mean 0.17 mumol/l, and total-Hb increased by a mean of 0.81 mumol/l. The hemodynamic response to visual stimulation in the occipital cortex in newborn infants is similar to adults. The increase in O(2)Hb and th…
21641616	In healthy young and elderly adults, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity (HPA AR) varies with increasing pharmacological challenge and with age, but not with gender.	aging	2011-10-??	BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity (HPA AR) is the key indicator of the psychophysiological response to stress. The HPA AR may vary with age and gender. To investigate these factors concurrently, the aims of the present study were to observe HPA AR (plasma ACTH and plasma cortisol) in response to a pharmacological challenge (dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone test: DEX/CRH-test) and as a function of age and gender.    METHOD: 19 young (10 females and 9 males; mean age = 24.05 years) and 23 elderly (11 females and 12 males; mean age = 71.61 years) healthy volunteers took part in the study. To assess HPA AR, participants underwent the combined DEX/CRH test applied with the following DEX doses: 0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 mg, respectively.    RESULTS: A dose-dependent response was observed in young adult participants, but not in elderly participants. With increasing DEX doses, ACTH and cortisol values decreased in young adult participants, while the decrea…
11701726	Semiquantification of hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone output in women: evidence for sexual dimorphism in the mechanism of the somatopause.	aging	2001-11-??	The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the decline of GH with aging (somatopause) are uncertain. We recently found that the age-dependent diminution of the hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) output contributes to the somatopause in men. As the regulatory mechanisms of GH secretion are sexually dimorphic, we assessed the suppressibility of spontaneous and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion by graded doses of a specific competitive GHRH receptor antagonist in nine young (20-27 yr old) and eight elderly (65-77 yr old) healthy nonobese women to semiquantify hypothalamic GHRH output. Nocturnal mean GH was lower in elderly women (2.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.2 microg/liter; P = 0.01). Graded boluses of GHRH-44 resulted in similar GH responses in both populations (P = 0.28). Graded infusions of GHRH antagonist inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the GH responses to GHRH in both groups (P = 0.0001-0.04). The dose-inhibition curve for the lowest GHRH bolus dose was shifted to the left compared …
3541894	The action of human articular-cartilage metalloproteinase on proteoglycan and link protein. Similarities between products of degradation in situ and in vitro.	aging	1986-07-01	Interleukin 1 stimulation of human articular cartilage in organ culture produced the concomitant release of proteoglycan fragments and latent metalloproteinase. The released fragments ranged in size from that of almost intact proteoglycan subunits to the product of limiting digestion generated by the activated metalloproteinase. None of the fragments possessed the ability to interact with hyaluronic acid. Analysis of proteoglycan aggregate digested with the activated metalloproteinase showed that isolated hyaluronic acid-binding regions were produced from the proteoglycan subunits, and that the two higher-Mr link-protein components (Mr 48,000 and 44,000) were converted into the lowest-Mr component (Mr 41,000). Link protein extracted from cartilage under stimulation with interleukin 1 showed a similar conversion. These results suggest that interleukin 1 stimulates the release of latent metalloproteinase from chondrocytes and that a proportion of the enzyme is activated in situ in the ca…
20437187	Influence of Lβ-, Dα- and Dβ-Asp isomers of the Asp-76 residue on the properties of αA-crystallin 70-88 peptide.	aging	2010-11-??	Proteins have been considered to consist exclusively of L-amino acids in living tissues. However, our previous studies showed that two specific aspartyl (Asp) residues in αA- and αB-crystallins from human eye lenses invert to the D-isomers to a high degree during aging. The reaction is also accompanied by isomerization into a form containing β-Asp (isoaspartate) residues. The appearance of D- and β-Asp in a protein potentially induces large changes to the higher order structure of the protein as well as to its function. However, it remains unclear whether the formation of the Asp isomer is the direct trigger of the change to the higher order structure and function. In this study, in order to clarify the effect of the inversion to D-isomers in a protein, we synthesized peptides corresponding to the 70-88 (KFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK) fragment of human αA-crystallin and its corresponding diastereoisomers in which Lα-Asp was replaced with Lβ-Asp, Dα-Asp, and Dβ-Asp at position 76 and compared the…
15247018	Algae extract protection effect on oxidized protein level in human stratum corneum.	aging	2004-06-??	Modification of proteins by reactive oxygen species is implicated in different disorders. The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase in charge of intracellular protein turnover and of oxidized proteins degradation. Consequently, proteasome function is very important in controlling the level of altered proteins in eukaryotic cells. Evidence for a decline in proteasome activity during skin photo-aging has been provided in Bulteau et al. in 2002. The ability of a lipid algae extract (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) to stimulate 20S proteasome peptidase activities was described by Nizard et al. in 2001. Furthermore, keratinocytes treated with Phaeodactylum tricornutum extract and then UVA and UVB irradiated, exhibited a sustained level of proteasome activity comparable to the one of nonirradiated cells. The level of modified proteins can be quantified by measurement of protein carbonyl content (Oxyblot technique), which has been shown to increase with aging and other disorders. In this paper…
15870126	Effects of aging on cytochrome b5 expression in the human adrenal gland.	aging	2005-07-??	CONTEXT: Aging in humans is characterized by a selective decline in circulating levels of adrenal androgens. The results of in vivo studies are suggestive of reduced adrenal 17,20-lyase activity in aging men and women.    OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether there are changes in the distribution and/or expression of cytochrome B5 (CytB5), an accessory protein important in the regulation of 17,20-lyase activity, in the adrenals of aging humans.    DESIGN: Comparison between younger and older adrenal glands.    SETTING: The study was conducted in a University Center.    PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Adrenal glands obtained at autopsy after sudden death as a result of trauma from 46 young (age 20-40 yr) and 26 older (age 50-91 yr) humans were obtained and fixed within 24 h postmortem.    INTERVENTIONS: Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and also were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for CytB5. All sections were quantitatively evaluated using an image…
27097372	microRNA-496 - A new, potentially aging-relevant regulator of mTOR.	lifespan, aging	2016-??-??	Recent findings strongly support a role for small regulatory RNAs in the regulation of human lifespan yet little information exists about the precise underlying mechanisms. Although extensive studies on model organisms have indicated that reduced activity of the nutrient response pathway, for example as a result of dietary restriction, can extend lifespan through the suppression of the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), it still is subject of debate whether this mechanism is operative in humans as well. Here, we present findings indicating that human microRNA (miR)-496 targets 2 sites within the human mTOR 3'UTR. Coexpression of miR-496 with different fusion transcripts, consisting of the luciferase transcript and either wild-type mTOR 3'UTR or mTOR 3'UTR transcript with the miR-496 binding sites singly or combined mutated, confirmed this prediction and revealed cooperativity between the 2 binding sites. miR-496 reduced the mTOR protein level in HeLa-K cells, and th…
11173673	The effects of strength training on sarcopenia.	aging	2001-02-??	In the past decade strength training has been investigated extensively as a means of reversing the muscle mass loss that occurs with aging (sarcopenia). High intensity resistance training (HIRT) has led to increased protein synthesis, along with muscle hypertrophy measured at the whole body, whole muscle, and muscle fibre levels, in older adults. Typically, the strength increments associated with HIRT have been much larger than the hypertrophic response. However, most HIRT periods have been quite short. Less is known about the long-term hypertrophic response to HIRT in older adults. In order to lessen the effects of sarcopenia, HIRT should continue over the long term in older adults, to improve functional performance and health.
3700982	Reduced serum calcium and inorganic phosphate levels in normal elderly women.	aging	1986-05-??	Because published data on the effect of normal aging on serum calcium and phosphate levels are scanty and contradictory, we measured these parameters in 36 normal women over the age of 65 and compared these values with those obtained previously and concurrently in younger women. We found a significant decline in both serum calcium and phosphate levels after the age of 65. We also measured corrected total serum calcium, serum ultrafiltrable calcium, and serum ionized calcium levels in all of the elderly women and in 29 of the younger women and concluded that the decline in total serum calcium levels seen with aging was attributable in part to decreased levels of protein bound calcium but that there was also a slight reduction of ionic calcium levels. Data obtained in elderly women with proven parathyroid adenomas are included to illustrate how the recognition of these age related changes in total serum calcium levels may aid in the identification of slight but clinically important hyper…
9592686	Phenotypic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells during aging: insulin effect on migration.	aging	1998-??-??	We examined the mechanisms by which insulin may be atherogenic during aging. We postulated that an increase in insulin secretion during aging produces growth factor effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), promoting these cells to synthesize collagen and to migrate. We have previously demonstrated that insulin stimulates collagen synthesis and release in senescent VSMCs that were obtained from a human organism with high levels of insulin secretion. Using the same experimental model, we now study the effects of insulin on VSMC migration. We demonstrate that insulin has a chemoattractant effect on VSMCs which occurs through insulin binding to its own specific receptors as opposed to its effect on collagen production. Blocking the insulin receptor significantly eliminates the insulin effect on cell migration. At the same molarity, the chemotactic effect of insulin is less pronounced than that of insulin-like growth factor-1. In spite of different mechanisms, there is a remarkable …
18398454	Acetylation regulates WRN catalytic activities and affects base excision DNA repair.	aging	2008-04-09	BACKGROUND: The Werner protein (WRN), defective in the premature aging disorder Werner syndrome, participates in a number of DNA metabolic processes, and we have been interested in the possible regulation of its function in DNA repair by post-translational modifications. Acetylation mediated by histone acetyltransferases is of key interest because of its potential importance in aging, DNA repair and transcription.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we have investigated the p300 acetylation mediated changes on the function of WRN in base excision DNA repair (BER). We show that acetylation of WRN increases in cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), suggesting that acetylation of WRN may play a role in response to DNA damage. This hypothesis is consistent with our findings that acetylation of WRN stimulates its catalytic activities in vitro and in vivo, and that acetylated WRN enhances pol beta-mediated strand displacement DNA synthesis more than unacetylated WRN. Furtherm…
20622276	The features of the full blood analysis in the gerontological age groups in the North-West area of Azerbaijan.	longevity	2010-06-??	The present work is devoted to the study of full blood test analysis in the geriatric age group in the North-West part of Azerbaijan, where level of longevity is not studied. The results of our analysis showed that in all three gerontological age groups living in these regions level of hemoglobin and quantity erythrocytes was below the norm. The low level of blood hemoglobin and the quantity of erythrocytes in all gerontological age groups is indicative of anemia in these areas. No deviations from the norm were observed in the levels of leukocytes and platelets. In the analysis of the data showing the dynamics blood sedimentation test in regard to age, in all gerontological age groups of these regions this index was identical and tended to approach the highest normal level. On the basis of our analyses it is possible notice that coagulation time in the studies age groups was shorter and slightly differed from the normal index. All these processes substantially affect the longevity inde…
26881118	Multisession Anodal tDCS Protocol Improves Motor System Function in an Aging Population.	aging	2016-??-??	OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of five consecutive, daily 20-minute sessions of M1 a-tDCS on motor learning in healthy, cognitively intact, aging adults.    DESIGN: A total of 23 participants (51 to 69 years old) performed five consecutive, daily 20-minute sessions of a serial reaction time task (SRT task) concomitant with either anodal (n = 12) or sham (n = 11) M1 a-tDCS.    RESULTS: We found a significant group × training sessions interaction, indicating that whereas aging adults in the sham group exhibited little-to-no sequence-specific learning improvements beyond the first day of training, reproducible improvements in the ability to learn new motor sequences over 5 consecutive sessions were the net result in age-equivalent participants from the M1 a-tDCS group. A significant main effect of group on sequence-specific learning revealed greater motor learning for the M1 a-tDCS group when the five learning sessions were averaged.    CONC…
1953989	The molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase in cerebrospinal fluid of normal subjects--effect of aging.	aging	1991-??-??	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is increased in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during aging. The present study investigated whether the relative amounts of different molecular forms of CSF-AChE are also affected during aging. Thus, the CSF samples of healthy human subjects (age range 20-79 years, n = 23) were analyzed for sedimentation forms of AChE activity. Five different forms of AChe activity were detected in human CSF. The relative amount of tetrameric and dimeric globular forms, which are the main forms of AChE in CSF, were not related with age. Furthermore, the relative amount of monomeric globular and asymmetric forms which are minor forms of AChE in CSF did not seem to be related to age. Since total CSF-AChE activity is increased during aging, it seems to be due to the increased amounts of the tetrameric and dimeric forms of enzyme activity.
18593825	The decline of serum testosterone levels in community-dwelling men over 70 years of age: descriptive data and predictors of longitudinal changes.	aging	2008-10-??	OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess longitudinal changes in serum testosterone levels, explore relationships with aging, genetic-, health-, and lifestyle-related factors, and investigate predictors of changes in healthy elderly men.    DESIGN: Population-based, longitudinal, 4-year observational study in 221 community-dwelling men aged 71-86 years at baseline.    METHODS: Hormone levels assessed by immunoassay, anthropometry, questionnaires on general health, and genetic polymorphisms. Predictors of changes in testosterone levels explored using linear mixed-effects modeling for longitudinal analyses.    RESULTS: Total testosterone (TT), free testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone (BioT) levels decreased with aging, decreases in BioT being most marked. No changes in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or estradiol (E(2)), while LH and FSH levels increased during follow-up. Subjects who gained weight displayed a greater decline in TT levels, mainly due to decreasing SHBG le…
16912661	Differential associations for menopause and age in measures of vitamin K, osteocalcin, and bone density: a cross-sectional exploratory study in healthy volunteers.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To distinguish the effects of midlife aging from early postmenopause on vitamin K measures, bone formation biomarkers, and bone density.    DESIGN: Cycling older volunteers (CO; 40-52 years, n = 19) were compared to cycling young (CY; 20-30 years, n = 21) and untreated, age-matched women in the early postmenopause years (EPM; 40-52 years, mean years PM = 2.8 +/- 0.5, n = 19). We assessed sex steroids, vitamin status (phylloquinone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, retinol), osteocalcin (OC), percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), and bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and hip with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.    RESULTS: CO women had similar estradiol and vitamin status as CY women, but lower OC (0.64 +/- 0.04 vs 0.97 +/- 0.08 nmol/L, P = 0.01) and BMD at the total hip (1.0038 +/- 0.032 vs 1.1126 +/- 0.030 g/cm2, P = 0.02). In the two older groups, BMD was similar at all sites, but OC was elevated in the EPM women (1.10 +/- 0.10 vs 0.64 +/- 0.04 nmol/L, EPM vs CO…
12038641	The X-ray attenuation characteristics and density of human calcaneal marrow do not change significantly during adulthood.	aging	2002-05-??	Changes in the material characteristics of bone marrow with aging can be a significant source of error in measurements of bone density when using X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. In the context of computed tomography, dual-energy computed techniques have been used to correct for changes in marrow composition. However, dual-energy quantitative computed tomography (DE-QCT) protocols, while increasing the accuracy of the measurement, reduce the precision and increase the radiation dose to the patient in comparison to single-energy quantitative computed tomography (SE-QCT) protocols. If the attenuation properties of the marrow for a particular bone can be shown to be relatively constant with age, it should be possible to use single-energy techniques without experiencing errors caused by unknown marrow composition. Marrow was extracted by centrifugation from 10 mm thick frontal sections of 34 adult cadaver calcanei (28 males, 6 females, ages 17-65 years). The density and energy-depe…
12714244	B cells in the aged: CD27, CD5, and CD40 expression.	aging	2003-04-??	Ageing is characterized by numerous changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. In the present paper we have focused on B cells carrying the surface markers CD27, CD5 and CD40. CD27 is considered a marker of primed (memory) cells and its engagement promotes the differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells. CD5 is expressed on B1 cells, which are considered to be responsible for T cell-independent antibody production other than autoantibodies. The CD40 molecule binds CD40L (CD154) and is necessary for T-dependent antibody responses. Here we show that the absolute number of CD5+ and CD40+ B cells is decreased in the elderly, while CD27+ B lymphocytes only marginally decrease in centenarians. However, there is a decrease of the percentage of CD5+ B cells, an increase of CD27+ B cells, while CD40 does not change significantly. These data, together with the increased number of NK cells during aging, suggest different regulation of antibody production in the elderly which might be another e…
25453742	Cerebral autoregulation in response to posture change in elderly subjects-assessment by wavelet phase coherence analysis of cerebral tissue oxyhemoglobin concentrations and arterial blood pressure signals.	aging	2015-02-01	This study aims to assess the dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) in response to posture change using wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of cerebral tissue oxyhemoglobin concentrations (Delta [HbO2]) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals in healthy elderly subjects. Continuous recordings of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and ABP signals were obtained from simultaneous measurements in 16 healthy elderly subjects (age: 68.9±7.1 years) and 19 young subjects (age: 24.9±3.2 years). The phase coherence between Delta [HbO2] and ABP oscillations in six frequency intervals (I, 0.6-2 Hz; II, 0.15-0.6 Hz; III, 0.05-0.15 Hz; IV, 0.02-0.05 Hz, V, 0.0095-0.02 Hz and VI, 0.005-0.0095 Hz) was analyzed using WPCO. The sit-to-stand posture change induces significantly lower WPCO in interval III (F=5.50 p=0.025) in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects. However, the stand-to-sit posture change induces higher WPCO in intervals II (F=5.25 p=0.028) and V (F=6.22 p=0.018) in the elderly subjec…
16497961	Gender differentials in cognitive impairment and decline of the oldest old in China.	longevity	2006-03-??	OBJECTIVE: Research in China has shown that women are significantly disadvantaged in cognitive functioning in old age. This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining gender differentials in the odds of having cognitive impairment at baseline and during follow-up among the Chinese oldest old, as well as the potential pathways linking gender and the likelihood of having cognitive impairment.    METHODS: Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the researcher estimated logistic and multinomial regression models of cognitive impairment for a nationwide sample of people aged 80-105 years old (N = 8,291).    RESULTS: Among the Chinese oldest old, women were at higher risk than men for having cognitive impairment both at baseline and during 2-year follow-up, controlling for age, activities of daily living disability, and rural residence. Women's disadvantages in socioeconomic status, social network, and participation in leisure activities p…
14577057	Interacting mediators of allostasis and allostatic load: towards an understanding of resilience in aging.	aging	2003-10-??	Individual differences in the aging process can be conceptualized as an accumulation of wear and tear of daily experiences and major life stressors that interact with the genetic constitution and predisposing early life experiences. The neuroendocrine system, autonomic nervous system, and immune system are mediators of adaptation to challenges of daily life, referred to as allostasis, meaning "maintaining stability through change." Physiological mediators such as adrenalin from the adrenal medulla, glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, and cytokines from cells of the immune system act upon receptors in various tissues and organs to produce effects that are adaptive in the short run but can be damaging if the mediators are not shut off when no longer needed. When release of the mediators is not efficiently terminated, their effects on target cells are prolonged, leading to other consequences that may include receptor desensitization and tissue damage. This process has been named "all…
15583371	Cumulative lead exposure and prospective change in cognition among elderly men: the VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2004-12-15	Lead exposure has been found to affect cognitive function in several different populations. Whether chronic low-level environmental exposure to lead results in cognitive decline among adults has not been examined. The authors assessed the relation between biomarkers of lead exposure and change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort of elderly US men. Bone lead was measured with K-shell x-ray fluorescence. A total of 466 men aged 67.4 (standard deviation, 6.6) years took the MMSE on two occasions that were an average of 3.5 (standard deviation, 1.1) years apart during the period 1993-2001 and had bone lead concentrations measured during the period 1991-2002. A one-interquartile range (20 microg/g of bone mineral) higher patella bone lead concentration was associated with a change in MMSE score of -0.24 (95% confidence interval: -0.44, -0.05) after adjustment for age, education, smoking, alcohol intake, and time between MMSE tests. This effe…
20380907	Capturing the serial nature of older drivers' responses towards challenging events: a simulator study.	aging	2010-05-??	Older drivers' ability to trigger simultaneous responses in reaction to simulated challenging road events was examined through crash risk and local analyses of acceleration and direction data provided by the simulator. This was achieved by segregating and averaging the simulator's primary measures according to six short time intervals, one before and five during the challenging events. Twenty healthy adults aged 25-45 years old (M=29.5+/-4.32) and 20 healthy adults aged 65 and older (M=73.4+/-5.17) were exposed to five simulated scenarios involving sudden, complex and unexpected maneuvres. Participants were also administered the Useful Field of View (UFOV), single reaction time and choice reaction time tests, a visual secondary task in the simulator, and a subjective workload evaluation (NASA-TLX). Results indicated that the challenging event that required multiple synchronized reactions led to a higher crash rate in older drivers. Acceleration and orientation data analyses confirmed t…
7521340	Aging is associated with decreased suppression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 by insulin.	aging	1993-11-??	We determined whether aging influences circulating insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations and, if so, whether this effect is explained by altered regulation of IGFBP-1 by insulin. Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, and IGFBP-1 were measured in 94 healthy volunteers, ages 24-93 yr. To determine the effect of aging on insulin-induced suppression of IGFBP-1, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 10 older (72-92 yr) and 10 younger (24-58 yr) nonobese subjects, matched for sex and body mass index. For all ages combined, the mean glucose level (+/- SE) averaged 4.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/L, and there was no significant change with aging. Fasting insulin and IGFBP-1 concentrations increased with advancing age (r = 0.37, P < 0.001 for age vs. insulin and r = 0.47, P < 0.001 for age vs. IGFBP-1). However, there was no correlation between insulin and IGFBP-1 concentrations. In multiple linear regression analysis, the age-related increase in IGFBP-1 was inde…
20959083	Stiffening of human skin fibroblasts with age.	aging	2010-10-20	Changes in mechanical properties are an essential characteristic of the aging process of human skin. Previous studies attribute these changes predominantly to the altered collagen and elastin organization and density of the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that individual dermal fibroblasts also exhibit a significant increase in stiffness during aging in vivo. With the laser-based optical cell stretcher we examined the viscoelastic biomechanics of dermal fibroblasts isolated from 14 human donors aged 27 to 80. Increasing age was clearly accompanied by a stiffening of the investigated cells. We found that fibroblasts from old donors exhibited an increase in rigidity of ∼60% with respect to cells of the youngest donors. A FACS analysis of the content of the cytoskeletal polymers shows a shift from monomeric G-actin to polymerized, filamentous F-actin, but no significant changes in the vimentin and microtubule content. The rheological analysis of fibroblast-populated collagen gels demo…
22728018	Accumulation of annexin A5 at the nuclear envelope is a biomarker of cellular aging.	aging	2012-07-??	Cellular senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest induced by short telomeres or oncogenic stress in vitro and in vivo. Because no single of the established biomarkers can reliably identify senescent cells, the application of new ones may aid the diagnosis of aged cells. Here we show that annexin A5 accumulates at the nuclear envelope during replicative and drug-induced cellular senescence in primary human fibroblasts. This new cellular aging phenotype that we have termed SA-ANX5 (senescence-associated accumulation at the nuclear envelope of annexin A5) is as efficient and quantitative as the well-established senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay and p21 immunoreactivity. SA-ANX5 is also observed in aged human skin where is exclusively detected in DNA damage foci-positive/Ki-67-negative cells. We also observed that depletion of annexin A5 by siRNA in human fibroblasts accelerates premature senescence through the p38MAP kinase pathway. These observations establish SA-AN…
26924924	Adjusting to a sudden “aging” of the lens.	lifespan	2016-03-??	Color perception is known to remain largely stable across the lifespan despite the pronounced changes in sensitivity from factors such as the progressive brunescence of the lens. However, the mechanisms and timescales controlling these compensatory adjustments are still poorly understood. In a series of experiments, we tracked adaptation in observers after introducing a sudden change in lens density by having observers wear glasses with yellow filters that approximated the average spectral transmittance of a 70-year-old lens. Individuals were young adults and wore the glasses for 5 days for 8 h per day while engaged in their normal activities. Achromatic settings were measured on a CRT before and after each daily exposure with the lenses on and off, and were preceded by 5 min of dark adaptation to control for short-term chromatic adaptation. During each day, there was a large shift in the white settings consistent with a partial compensation for the added lens density. However, there w…
24676321	Plasma vitamin D levels and cognitive function in aging women: the nurses' health study.	aging	2014-04-??	BACKGROUND: Vitamin D may play a role in preserving cognitive function. However, there is a paucity of prospective studies on the relationship between vitamin D and cognition with aging. The aim of this study was to examine the association between plasma levels of vitamin D and subsequent cognitive function.    METHODS: This is a prospective study including 1,185 women aged 60-70 years from the Nurses' Health Study, who had plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels measured in 1989-1990 and completed an initial Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status approximately 9 years later. Subsequently, three follow-up cognitive assessments were conducted at 1.5-2.0 years intervals. We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression to model initial cognitive function, and mixed linear regression to model change in cognitive function over time.    RESULTS: Lower vitamin D levels were associated with significantly worse cognitive function 9 years later. For example, the mean global composite score averagin…
17522351	Age-related increase of insoluble, phosphorylated small heat shock proteins in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2007-05-??	Among mammalian heat shock proteins (Hsps), small Hsps (sHsps) are constitutively expressed in skeletal muscles. We investigated age-related changes of phosphorylation and cellular distribution of representative sHsps (Hsp27 and alphaB-crystallin) in human vastus lateralis muscle under resting conditions. We also examined upstream kinases which may be responsible for phosphorylation of sHsps, namely p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2. The study groups consisted of nine young (15-38 years old) and nine aged (51-79 years old) patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. sHsps protein levels were higher in the insoluble fraction of aged muscles. The phosphorylated states of sHsps were enhanced in both the soluble and insoluble fraction of aged patients. The phosphorylated form of each upstream kinase was elevated in aged patients. Ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in the insoluble fractions of aged mus…
11993715	Study of the paraoxonase and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activities with aging.	aging	????-??-??	The purpose of this study was to investigate, with aging, the activity of two enzymes associated to HDL and responsible for its anti-atherogenic activity; paraoxonase (PON1) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). Ninety-five subjects aged between 26 and 77 years were recruited for the study. The prevalence of phenotype A, AB, and B in our subjects group was 69.47,21.05 and 9.47% respectively. Plasma as well as HDL paraoxonase activity decreased significantly with aging (r =-0.218, P < 0.039) and (r = -0.280, P < 0.006) respectively. PAF-AH activity was unchanged with aging however, we noted a negative correlation between PAF-AH and PON1 activity in HDL (r = -0.243, P < 0.02) and in LDL vs HDL (r =-0.462, P < 0.001).
16860994	Hemostasis and aging.	aging	2006-11-??	Many changes in the vasculature, hemostasis and endothelium, including alterations of platelets, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, occur during aging. While the increasing hypercoagulability observed with aging may account for the higher incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular disorders in the elderly, the lack of genetic protective factors against thrombosis in healthy centenarians suggests that little is yet known about the age-associated changes of hemostasis. The complex inter-relationships between inherited and acquired factors influencing the hemostatic system during aging are discussed in this review.
20547889	Sphingolipid distribution changes with age in the human lens.	aging	2010-09-??	The formation of an internal barrier to the diffusion of small molecules in the lens during middle age is hypothesized to be a key event in the development of age-related nuclear (ARN) cataract. Changes in membrane lipids with age may be responsible. In this study, we investigated the effect of age on the distribution of sphingomyelins, the most abundant lens phospholipids. Human lens sections were initially analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. A distinct annular distribution of the dihydrosphingomyelin, DHSM (d18:0/16:0), in the barrier region was observed in 64- and 70-year-old lenses but not in a 23-year-old lens. An increase in the dihydroceramide, DHCer (d18:0/16:0), in the lens nucleus was also observed in the older lenses. These findings were supported by ESI mass spectrometry analysis of lipid extracts from lenses dissected into outer, barrier, and nuclear regions. A subsequent analysis of 18 lenses ages 20-72 years revealed that sphingomyelin levels increased with age …
30006643	CT-based tissue segmentation to assess knee joint inflammation and reactive bone formation assessed by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG and <sup>18</sup>F-NaF PET/CT: Effects of age and BMI.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the role of computed tomography (CT)-based segmentation methodology to semi-quantify the degree of inflammation and reactive bone formation in the knee joints by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) and F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/CT (F-NaF PET/CT) imaging, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of aging and body mass index (BMI) on these biological responses.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we examined a total of 97 subjects who had undergone both F-FDG and F-NaF PET/CT scanning. The mean age was 49.3±14.9 (21-75) and the mean BMI was 26.7±4.3 (17.7-42.0). Whole joint compartments and osseous compartments were segmented on fused PET/CT images using a 3D-growing algorithm with an adjustable upper/lower Hounsfield Units (HU) thresholds and manual tools. The metabolic activity and volume of each compartment was measured, values from the osseous compartment were subtracted from the whole…
8687046	Tandem duplications and large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA are early molecular events of human aging process.	aging	1996-06-15	Large-scale deletions and tandem duplications of mtDNA, which were originally identified in the patients with KSS or CPEO, have recently been found, although with lower abundance, in various tissues of aged individuals. By use of PCR techniques with back-to-back primers, we demonstrated for the first time that small tandem duplications occur in the D-loop of mtDNA in an age-dependent manner in human tissues. A total of 10 types of such tandem duplications were identified and confirmed by primer-shift PCR and DNA sequencing. Based on the sequence characteristics of the junction sites, we classified these small tandem duplications into 3 groups. Most of the tandem duplications were found to occur at hot spots containing poly C runs, and the number of C residues exhibited wide variations in type I, II, V, VI, VII, and VIII duplications. These observations suggest that these tandem duplications may be generated through similar recombination mechanisms. Among them, type I, II, III, IV and I…
9479068	Developmental and aging changes of Bak expression in the human brain.	aging	1998-02-02	The gene bak regulates apoptosis. To explore its role in the human central nervous system, we examined the distribution of its protein product, Bak, in the brains at various ages, by immunochemical and immunohistochemical means. Western blotting revealed that Bak expression in the cerebrum and cerebellum is high in the brains of the fetuses and elderly subjects, but low in those of young adults. Immunostaining of the cerebellum localized Bak immunoreactivity to Purkinje cells, which was strong in the fetal period and senescence, but undetectable from infancy to adolescence. These results suggest that bak regulates neuronal death associated with the development and aging of the central nervous system.
12213557	Antioxidant pathways in human aged skeletal muscle: relationship with the distribution of type II fibers.	aging	????-??-??	Type II fiber loss and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage are hallmarks of muscle aging. The aim of this study was to analyze whether there exists a relationship between age-dependent changes in cellular antioxidant capacity and type II fiber loss in aged human skeletal muscles. Forty-five male and female subjects ranging in age from 65 to 90 year-old were divided into +40 and -40% type II fiber groups. We measured both total and Mn superoxide dismutase (total and MnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) and catalase (CAT) activities. We also measured the reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and lipid peroxide (LPO) levels. Total SOD activity was lower in the -40% type II fiber group than in the +40% group; MnSOD tended to be lower but data are not statistically consistent. Both GSHPx and CAT activities remained unchanged; as did GSH, GSSG and GSH/GSSG ratio. Finally, muscle samples with -40% type II fibers had a significantly higher LPO content compared to …
15886406	Age-related peculiarities of breathing regulation and antioxidant enzymes under intermittent hypoxic training.	aging	2003-09-??	Aging is associated with changes in breathing regulation, particularly, in respiratory sensitivity to hypoxic stimuli. One theory of aging holds that reactive oxygen species play a key role in this process. These species have also been implicated in the carotid body O2 sensing. In the present study we investigated hypoxic ventilatory responses (HVR) and antioxidant enzymes activity in healthy young and elderly people under a 14-day adaptation to intermittent hypoxic training (IHT). The elderly demonstrated decreased HVR and blood catalase (CAT) activity on a background of strong negative correlation between the levels of end-tidal CO(2) tension and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The adaptation to IHT resulted in increased HVR and SOD activity in both groups, and decreased CAT activity in young persons compared with its augmentation in the elderly. Increased SOD activity testifies to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species during IHT. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen speci…
15737671	Molecular aging in human prefrontal cortex is selective and continuous throughout adult life.	aging	2005-03-01	BACKGROUND: Aging leads to morphologic and functional changes in the brain and is associated with increased risk for psychiatric and neurological disorders.    METHODS: To identify age-related transcriptional changes in the human brain, we profiled gene expression in two prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas in postmortem samples from 39 subjects, ranging in age from 13 to 79 years.    RESULTS: Robust transcriptional age-related changes were identified for at least 540 genes. Gene expression correlates of aging were highly specific, and the large majority of the 22,000 transcripts investigated were unaffected by age. Across subjects, changes were progressive throughout adult life and accurately predicted chronological age. Age-upregulated transcripts were mostly of glial origin and related to inflammation and cellular defenses, whereas downregulated genes displayed mostly neuron-enriched transcripts relating to cellular communication and signaling.    CONCLUSIONS: Continuous changes in gene ex…
15529019	Spontaneous low-frequency oscillations decline in the aging brain.	aging	2004-10-??	It is well known that aging leads to a degeneration of the vascular system. Hence, one may hypothesize that spontaneous oscillations decrease in the cerebral microvasculature with aging. Accordingly, the authors investigated the age dependency of spontaneous oscillations in the visual cortex during rest and functional activation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used because it is particularly sensitive to the microvasculature. Visual stimulation led to an increase of oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and a decrease of deoxyhemoglobin, without any influence of age. Peaks of normalized power spectral density were detected for spontaneous low-frequency (0.07 to 0.11 Hz) and very-low-frequency (0.01 to 0.05 Hz) oscillations, with a higher amplitude for oxyhemoglobin than for deoxyhemoglobin. Spontaneous low-frequency oscillations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin declined strongly with aging during both rest and visual stimulation. Reduction of spontaneous low-frequency oscilla…
26458289	The vitamin D status and its effects on life quality among the elderly in Jinan, China.	aging	????-??-??	A challenge for researchers is that vitamin D has many functions in the body, and vitamin D status across the world is not optimistic. There was little data regarding insufficient vitamin D status and its adverse effect on health of elderly Chinese people. So we selected 686 subjects (310 men and 376 women) aged 60-89 years to explore the correlation between vitamin D status and their life quality in a community-based osteoporosis prevention study at Qianfoshan Hospital of Shandong University from 2009 to 2010. All subjects were divided into three groups: vitamin D adequacy [serum 25(OH)D ≧ 75 nmol/L], hypovitaminosis D (50-74.9 nmol/L), and vitamin D insufficiency (<50 nmol/L). Participants were requested to complete SF-36 health survey. The regression models were used to evaluate respectively the association between 25(OH)D levels and parameters of SF-36. As a result, serum 25(OH)D levels were 58.60 nmol/L in male [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 56.7-60.5 nmol/L] and 54.17 nmol/L …
28683378	A prospective study of associations among helping, health, and longevity.	longevity, aging	2017-??-??	How does helping behavior contribute to the health and the longevity of older helpers? From an evolutionary perspective, the ultimate cause may be rooted in ancestral parenting and grandparenting. These activities may have generalized to a neural and hormonal caregiving system that also enabled prosocial behavior beyond the family. From a psychological perspective, helping others may be associated with healthy aging, which, in turn, contributes to longevity as a proximate cause. Yet little is known about the extent to which mediating factors such as the health benefits of helping behaviors translate into enhanced longevity, particularly in regard to grandparenting. To fill this gap, we conducted mediation analyses (structural equation models) to examine whether grandparenting and supporting others in the social network contributed directly or indirectly (through better health 5-6 years later) to the longevity of older helpers. We drew on longitudinal data from the Berlin Aging Study (N…
9330974	Cortisol enhances non-REM sleep and growth hormone secretion in elderly subjects.	aging	????-??-??	Aging is accompanied by a continuous decline in slow wave sleep (SWS) and in growth hormone (GH) secretion, particularly during the sleeping period. Because short-term pulsatile administration of cortisol increases GH release and SWS in young adults, we wondered whether similar effects can be induced also in elderly men. Hourly injections of cortisol between 1700 and 600 h increased stage 2 and SWS and decreased rapid eye movement sleep. Spectral analysis revealed significant increases in delta and theta power. Cortisol infusions increased the GH secretion prior to sleep onset, but remained largely unchanged during sleep. Thus, sleep EEG and GH release are modulated by cortisol administration in a manner similar to that in young subjects, but to a lesser extent. The stimulatory effect of cortisol on both GH release and SWS points to a mechanism involving glucocorticoid-enhanced production and release of GH-releasing hormone that activates pituitary GH release and simultaneously antagon…
22345276	Enumeration of human peripheral blood dendritic cells throughout the life.	aging	2012-06-??	Human aging is associated with immunosenescence, a process characterized by alterations in numerical and functional features of immune system components. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main antigen-presenting cells, playing a pivotal role in adaptive and innate immunity. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of human circulating DCs throughout the life, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the physiological background underlying the aging of immune system. Cytofluorimetric analysis of peripheral blood samples by all-aged healthy population showed a significant decrease of circulating DCs and of their two main subsets among age. This reduction was limited to the plasmacytoid cell subtype when young and old subjects were analyzed separately. The analysis of circulating Treg cell number in a cohort of the subjects showed a significant reduction with increasing age and a positive significant correlation to myeloid or plasmacytoid absolute numbers. In conclusion, this work provid…
12773225	An integral view of the neuroendocrine aspects of male sexual dysfunction and aging.	aging	2003-04-??	Age is the most important factor associated with sexual dysfunction. The traditional thinking explained this association by the neurovascular events developing with the aging process. More recently, central neuro-endocrine mechanisms resulting from apoptosis in the hypothalamic areas involved in both the production of sex hormones and the control of sexual processes have added a new dimension to human sexuality. This evidence is still controversial but of unquestionable importance in our understanding of endocrine alterations and sexual shortcomings associated with aging.
19643185	Anatomical atlas-guided diffuse optical tomography of brain activation.	aging	2010-01-01	We describe a neuroimaging protocol that utilizes an anatomical atlas of the human head to guide diffuse optical tomography of human brain activation. The protocol is demonstrated by imaging the hemodynamic response to median-nerve stimulation in three healthy subjects, and comparing the images obtained using a head atlas with the images obtained using the subject-specific head anatomy. The results indicate that using the head atlas anatomy it is possible to reconstruct the location of the brain activation to the expected gyrus of the brain, in agreement with the results obtained with the subject-specific head anatomy. The benefits of this novel method derive from eliminating the need for subject-specific head anatomy and thus obviating the need for a subject-specific MRI to improve the anatomical interpretation of diffuse optical tomography images of brain activation.
11053067	Synovial fluid chondroitin sulphate epitopes 3B3 and 7D4, and glycosaminoglycan in human knee osteoarthritis after exercise.	aging	2000-11-??	OBJECTIVE: Walking exercise alleviates some symptoms, such as pain, in patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, a major concern is that weightbearing exercise on osteoarthritic joints may exacerbate articular cartilage degradation. Loading of proteoglycan depleted articular cartilage in vitro increased expression of the chondroitin sulphate epitope 3B3, suggesting that loading may influence metabolism of osteoarthritic cartilage. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of walking exercise on articular cartilage metabolism in patients with knee OA, as reflected by changes in concentrations of synovial fluid markers.    METHODS: Thirty elderly patients with knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II to IV) were randomly allocated to control (n = 15) and 12 week exercise (n = 15) groups. Synovial fluid obtained from 21 of the patients at time zero and after 12 weeks was examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the chondroitin sulphate epitopes 3B3 an…
19959767	Age and sex influence the balance between maximal cardiac output and peripheral vascular reserve.	aging	2010-03-??	We evaluated the influence of age and sex on the relationship between central and peripheral vasodilatory capacity. Healthy men (19 younger, 12 older) and women (17 younger, 17 older) performed treadmill and knee extensor exercise to fatigue on separate days while maximal cardiac output (Q, acetylene uptake) and peak femoral blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound) were measured, respectively. Maximal Q was reduced with age similarly in men (Y: 23.6 +/- 2.7 vs. O: 17.4 +/- 3.5 l/min; P < 0.05) and women (Y: 17.7 +/- 1.9 vs. O: 12.3 +/- 1.6 l/min; P < 0.05). Peak FBF was similar between younger (Y) and older (O) men (Y: 2.1 +/- 0.5 vs. O: 2.2 +/- 0.7 l/min) but was lower in older women compared with younger women (Y: 1.9 +/- 0.4 vs. O: 1.4 +/- 0.4 l/min; P < 0.05). Maximal Q was positively correlated with peak FBF in men (Y: r = 0.55, O: r = 0.74; P < 0.05) but not in women (Y: r = 0.34, O: r = 0.10). Normalization of cardiac output to appendicular muscle mass and peak FBF to quadriceps mas…
2647500	Human lens membrane proteinase: purification and age-related distributional changes in the water-soluble and insoluble protein fractions.	aging	1989-02-??	A proteinase from human lens membrane was purified by a procedure previously developed for a similar proteinase from bovine lenses (Srivastava, 1988a). The purification of the human proteinase was achieved by solubilization of the enzyme from membranes with 2% sodium deoxycholate followed by two consecutive passages through an Agarose A-1.5 m column. The purified proteinase exhibited molecular weight of 38 kDa on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against bovine lens membrane proteinase, and used as a probe to examine distribution of the enzyme among water-soluble and insoluble proteins of human lenses of different ages. The antiserum had strict specificity to the human membrane proteinase as it showed immunoreaction to only the proteinase among human membrane proteins and crystallins. In addition, the antiserum also inhibited the proteinase activity on incubation. The Western blot of water-soluble proteins from 2-yr-old lens showed a 22 kDa immunoreactive prot…
9989940	Concurrent increase of oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation together with mitochondrial DNA mutation in human lung tissues during aging--smoking enhances oxidative stress on the aged tissues.	aging	1999-02-15	Although mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in human tissues has been established to associate with intrinsic aging, the impact of environmental factors on the formation and accumulation of mtDNA mutations and oxidative DNA damage in human tissues is poorly understood. We have investigated the levels of mtDNA with the 4977-bp deletion and A3243G point mutation, oxidative DNA damage (indicated by the formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-OH-dG), and lipid peroxides in lung tissues from smokers and nonsmokers of subjects of different ages. The results showed concurrent age-dependent increase of the 4977-bp deleted mtDNA (P < 0.001), 8-OH-dG (P < 0.05), and lipid peroxides (P < 0.05) in the human lung. In the group of subjects above 60 years old, smokers had more extensive DNA damage and lipid peroxidation than did the nonsmokers. However, the levels of mtDNA with the 4977-bp deletion and A3243G point mutation in the lung of smokers were not significantly different from those of …
10100932	The effect of modelling and remodelling on human vertebral body architecture.	aging	1998-12-??	Vertebral bone strength is determined by several factors: cortical thickness, bone size, trabecular bone density, and microarchitecture. All these factors change with age as a result of the two dynamic processes: remodelling and modelling. When the changes become pronounced, osteoporotic fractures occur. There is a different aging pattern for men and women: 1. Men achieve a higher peak bone mass than women (mainly because of a larger cross-sectional area of their bones); 2. Men have no accelerated bone loss in middle age; and 3. Men seem to be able to compensate for their loss of cancellous bone strength by increasing their vertebral cross-sectional area with age. The general pattern, for both men and women is, though, that of an extreme (70-80%) decline in whole vertebral body strength during normal aging. The accompanying decline in bone density is much less pronounced (35-45%). This clearly illustrates the power relationship between bone density and strength. However, the role of ch…
11028769	Separation of erythrocytes into age-related fractions by density or size? Counterflow centrifugation.	aging	2000-07-??	During the process of aging red blood cells become denser and smaller. Counterflow centrifugation separates particles of lower density and smaller diameter from those of higher density and bigger diameter. Thus, the question arises: which property of the red cells, density or size, governs the age-related separation by counterflow centrifugation? It is shown that it is the size which dominates the balance between sedimentation and streaming. Age-related separation of human red blood cells by counterflow centrifugation (elutriation) was analysed by the standard hematological parameters (hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), hemoglobin A1c and the membrane protein ratio 4.1a/(4.1a+4.1b). Red blood cells with a high hemoglobin A1c content and a high 4.1a/(4.1a+4.1b) ratio were found in the early fractions of the elutriation. This proves that old cells make up early fractions, while the "youngsters" constitute later…
9060972	Salivary cortisol levels and stress reactivity in human aging.	aging	1997-03-??	BACKGROUND: While homeostatic mechanisms are generally believed to become less efficient in the aging organism, evidence for changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function is inconclusive. Previous studies report higher, lower, or unchanged basal cortisol levels in human aging. Delayed recovery of glucocorticoids to baseline following stress exposure has been observed in aging rats, but the generalizability of these findings to humans remains unclear.    METHODS: Salivary-free cortisol was measured at home and in response to a laboratory speech task in 56 healthy men and women in three age groups (range 43-86 yr).    RESULTS: Higher basal cortisol levels were observed in older age groups. Gender, recent life stress, and current distress showed no relationship to basal levels. The magnitude of cortisol responses to the speech task differed by age, with the smallest responses in the oldest group. This pattern was robust in men, with the youngest subjects (40-59 yr) showing both the l…
29293550	Test-retest reliability of myelin imaging in the human spinal cord: Measurement errors versus region- and aging-induced variations.	aging	2018-??-??	PURPOSE: To implement a statistical framework for assessing the precision of several quantitative MRI metrics sensitive to myelin in the human spinal cord: T1, Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR), saturation imposed by an off-resonance pulse (MTsat) and Macromolecular Tissue Volume (MTV).    METHODS: Thirty-three healthy subjects within two age groups (young, elderly) were scanned at 3T. Among them, 16 underwent the protocol twice to assess repeatability. Statistical reliability indexes such as the Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were compared across metrics quantified within different cervical levels and white matter (WM) sub-regions. The differences between pathways and age groups were quantified and interpreted in context of the test-retest repeatability of the measurements.    RESULTS: The MDC was respectively 105.7ms, 2.77%, 0.37% and 4.08% for T1, MTR, MTsat and MTV when quantified over all WM, while the standard-deviation across subjects was 70.5ms, 1.34%, 0.20% and 2.44%. Even t…
16621168	Age-related changes in brain activation during a delayed item recognition task.	aging	2007-05-??	To test competing models of age-related changes in brain functioning (capacity limitation, neural efficiency, compensatory reorganization, and dedifferentiation), young (n=40; mean age=25.1 years) and elderly (n=18; mean age=74.4 years) subjects performed a delayed item recognition task for visually presented letters with three set sizes (1, 3, or 6 letters) while being scanned with BOLD fMRI. Spatial patterns of brain activity corresponding to either the slope or y-intercept of fMRI signal with respect to set size during memory set encoding, retention delay, or probe stimulus presentation trial phases were compared between elder and young populations. Age effects on fMRI slope during encoding and on fMRI y-intercept during retention delay were consistent with neural inefficiency; age effects on fMRI slope during retention delay were consistent with dedifferentiation. None of the other fMRI signal components showed any detectable age effects. These results suggest that, even within the…
8156175	UVA irradiation stimulates the synthesis of various matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cultured human fibroblasts.	aging	1993-03-??	UVA irradiation leads to photoaging including clinical features such as wrinkle formation, reduced recoil capacity and blister formation of the skin. Besides synthesis of the extracellular matrix, its regulated degradation by various matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) determines the amount and the composition of the extracellular matrix within the dermis and the basement membrane of the dermo-epidermal junction. In this study we therefore ascertained whether UV irradiation could modulate the synthesis of MMPs with substrate specificities for dermal (collagen I, III, V) and basement membrane compounds (collagen IV, VII, proteoglycans, laminin) and whether synthesis of the counteracting tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) was also affected. Following UVA irradiation specific mRNAs of MMPs 1, 2 and 3 were induced concomitantly up to 5-fold compared to mock irradiated controls. In contrast, TIMP-1 mRNA levels remained unaltered. Immunoprecipitation indicated that after UVA irradi…
23508416	Association between blood pressure and DNA methylation of retrotransposons and pro-inflammatory genes.	aging	2013-02-??	BACKGROUND: Methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression that changes with age, but its contribution to aging-related disorders, including high blood pressure (BP), is still largely unknown. We examined the relation of BP to the methylation of retrotransposon sequences of DNA and of selected candidate genes.    METHODS: This investigation included 789 elderly participants in the Normative Aging Study, ranging in age from 55 to 100 years, who had longitudinal measurements of DNA methylation. In these subjects' DNA we measured the proportion of methylated sites in retrotransposable sequences and in pro-inflammatory genes, expressed as the percent of 5-methylated cytosines (%5mC) among all cytosines. From one to four methylation measurements were made for each subject between 1999 and 2009. We fit mixed-effects models, using repeated measures of BP as the outcome and DNA methylation as the explanatory variable, adjusting for confounding variable…
12687640	Different effect of age on dopamine transporters in the dorsal and ventral striatum of controls and alcoholics.	aging	2003-06-15	It is generally agreed that there is a deterioration in brain dopamine (DA) system with aging. The role of the mesolimbic DA in brain ethanol reinforcement is well established, with nucleus accumbens (NAC) serving as a major terminal area of this system, whereas dorsal striatum is more associated with motor control. The aim of this study was to compare putative age-related alterations of dopamine transporters (DAT) in dorsal and ventral striatum of healthy controls and alcoholics. We studied the effect of age on DAT in caudate (NC), putamen (Pu), and nucleus accumbens (NAC) of eight type 1 and 2 alcoholics and 10 healthy controls by using [(125)I]PE2I as a radioligand for postmortem human whole hemisphere autoradiography. In the type 1 alcoholic group age and DAT density did not correlate significantly with any of the structures studied. The mean densities of DAT declined significantly with age in controls and type 2 alcoholics in dorsal striatum (NC, Pu) (range of correlation coeffici…
23690102	Association of vitamin D receptor with longevity and healthy aging.	longevity, aging	2013-05-07	Longevity is a multifaceted trait in which variety of genes and environmental factors are involved. Newly, the role of vitamin D has been revived regarding its potential advantage on delaying the aging process. Vitamin D exerts its effect through vitamin D receptor (VDR). VDR-FokI is the only polymorphism which alters the VDR length. We examined the frequency of FokI genotypes in old age population as compared to young adults to determine the discerning genotype of FokI polymorphism leading to longer living. In addition, to highlight the position of FokІ polymorphism in quality of life; a cognitive function assessment was performed. 728 participants participated in this study of which 166 individuals were elderly residents of Kahrizak Charity Foundation. The rest were participants of Iranian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (IMOS). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and VDR genotype was detected by the polymerase chain reaction. The participants in the elderly group underwen…
9545946	Osteocalcin expression in young and aged dental pulps as determined by RT-PCR.	aging	1997-06-??	Dental pulps were obtained from third molars of young adults (17-25 yr) or from molar teeth of individuals > 50 yr of age and examined for the expression of osteocalcin (OC) mRNA by RT-PCR. OC was selected as a determinant of pulp vitality, because it has long been associated with the production of hard tissue matrix in teeth and bone. For comparative purposes, the expression of OC in each pulp was normalized relative to its housekeeping gene-product GAPDH by the establishment of a OC/GAPDH ratio. This study demonstrated that OC expression, presumably by cells of odontoblast lineage, does not diminish relative to the extant cell population. Our findings suggest, despite a reduction in volume and cell numbers, that the pulps of aging teeth retain a capacity for dentin deposition and a potential for caries and trauma resistance.
1648847	Effect of age on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenergic responsiveness.	aging	1991-05-??	Beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists are among the most widely used classes of agents in the US today. Heterogeneity in pharmacologic response among humans exists. This article reviews the influence of age on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor responses. Evidence obtained in humans indicates that beta-adrenergic receptor numbers on peripheral blood cells may differ, although the direction of the change is not consistent among laboratories. Drug-induced regulation of receptors either up or down appears to be similar among age groups. The affinity of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites for isoproterenol decreases with aging. Events distal to the receptor recognition site itself exhibit age-related differences, presumably due to a decrease in the coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase. Mechanisms of decreased catecholamine responsiveness during aging remain to be defined. The precise definition of these alterations may contribute useful insights into the changes t…
8852933	The cytoskeleton in ATP-depleted erythrocytes: the effect of shape transformation.	aging	1996-02-24	Erythrocyte aging, accompanied by reduced deformability and low ATP level, is considered to be among the factors limiting the survival of old erythrocytes. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of reversible erythrocyte shape changes of discocyte-echinocyte-discocyte, following ATP-depletion and repletion with adenosine of normal human erythrocytes, on the cytoskeletal network. The effect becomes evident from electron microscopical observations on Triton-treated erythrocyte membranes. The two-dimensional lattice of spectrin-actin junction polygons increases in size in ATP-depleted erythrocytes. This may be due to the spectrin elasticity permitting an expansion of the skeletal lattice. The observations demonstrate alterations in the configuration of the filamentous units visualized in the cytoskeleton during the process of reversible erythrocyte shape changes, a capacity which is limited in aged human erythrocytes.
11530074	Role of Fas-ligand in age-related maculopathy not established.	aging	2001-09-??	PURPOSE: Fas-ligand expression on retinal pigment epithelium is hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on human ocular neovascularization.    METHODS: We studied Fas-ligand expression in the aging retinal pigment epithelium and in early and late stages of age-related maculopathy. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against Fas-ligand was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of 23 human eye bank eyes (aged 45 to 96 years) and 12 eyes with exudative age-related maculopathy.    RESULTS: Fas-ligand expression in retinal pigment epithelium was not related to age or to the presence of early age-related maculopathy. Furthermore, Fas-ligand expression in retinal pigment epithelium was similar in subretinal and subretinal pigment epithelium choroidal neovascular membranes.    CONCLUSION: It appears to be unlikely that Fas-ligand expressed on retinal pigment epithelium controls the extension of choroidal neovascular membranes from subretinal pigment epithelium to subretinal.
4083569	Aortic connective tissue in ageing--a biochemical study.	aging	1985-12-??	The biochemical analysis of samples of aortic connective tissue was carried out in 22 subjects from 9 to 84 years old. Aortic samples were taken at necropsy performed after sudden or, more often, traumatic death. The results suggest that aging of the aorta is accompanied by an increase both in collagen content and in total sugar content when expressed as mg/cm2 while the elastin content, when expressed in the same way, does not undergo any variation.
22103306	Dopaminergic and cholinergic modulations of visual-spatial attention and working memory: insights from molecular genetic research and implications for adult cognitive development.	aging	2012-05-??	Attention and working memory are fundamental for selecting and maintaining behaviorally relevant information. Not only do both processes closely intertwine at the cognitive level, but they implicate similar functional brain circuitries, namely the frontoparietal and the frontostriatal networks, which are innervated by cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways. Here we review the literature on cholinergic and dopaminergic modulations of visual-spatial attention and visual working memory processes to gain insights on aging-related changes in these processes. Some extant findings have suggested that the cholinergic system plays a role in the orienting of attention to enable the detection and discrimination of visual information, whereas the dopaminergic system has mainly been associated with working memory processes such as updating and stabilizing representations. However, since visual-spatial attention and working memory processes are not fully dissociable, there is also evidence of interac…
8964862	Changes in quantitative bone histomorphometry in aging healthy men.	aging	1996-06-??	Changes in bone mineral metabolism with aging in healthy men and the roles of various factors in the pathogenesis of age-related changes in quantitative bone histomorphometry in men are poorly defined. To clarify these changes and factors, serum and urinary biochemical parameters and iliac crest bone biopsies were evaluated in 43 healthy men, aged 20-80 yr. The static histomorphometric parameters, cancellous bone volume and osteoblast-osteoid interface, decreased by 40.0% and 19.2%, respectively, between 20-80 yr of age. The dynamic histomorphometric parameters, double and single labeled osteoid, also decreased by 18.6% and 18.0%, respectively, over this period. None of the other static or dynamic histomorphometric parameters changed with age in this population sample of healthy men. Univariate analysis of static bone histomorphometric parameters and biochemical parameters revealed significant correlations between osteoid surface and intact PTH (r = 0.37; P = 0.015); osteoclast surface…
1624142	Hyaluronic acid in progeria and the aged phenotype?	aging	1992-??-??	Hyaluronic acid (HA) is implicated in functions such as vascularity, morphogenesis, repair, and the general integrity of the extracellular matrix. Hence, it is considered possible that HA is involved in the most conspicuous features of the progeroid phenotype. However, it is not known whether the increase in HA excretion seen in progeria patients is due to a primary genetic defect or is a secondary effect due to some deeper problem. The phenomenon of 'normal' aging is suggested to have a more complex etiology and phenotype than progeria and the role of HA levels is less well-defined.
17009593	Reduced heat shock response in human mononuclear cells during aging and its association with polymorphisms in HSP70 genes.	longevity	2006-??-??	Age-dependent changes in heat shock response (HSR) were studied in mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocytes) collected from young (mean age = 22.6 +/- 1.7 years) and middle-aged (mean age = 56.3 +/- 4.7 years) subjects after 1 hour of heat shock at 42 degrees C. Genotype-specific HSR was measured by genotyping the subjects for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms, HSPA1A(A-110C), HSPA1B(A1267G), and HSPA1L(T2437C), 1 each in the 3 HSP70 genes. A significant age-related decrease in the induction of Hsp70 occurred after heat shock in both monocytes and lymphocytes. The noninducible and inducible forms of Hsp70 decreased 1.3-fold (P < 0.001) and 1.4-fold (P < 0.001), respectively, in the monocytes with age. In the young subjects, a positive association was found between HSPA1L(T2437C) polymorphism and HSR. CC carriers had a significantly lower induction than TT carriers in both monocytes (P = 0.015) and lymphocytes (P = 0.044). This polymorphism, which is present in the coding region of …
1279816	Age-related phenomena in the lumbar intervertebral discs. Lipofuscin and amyloid deposition.	aging	1992-10-??	In 69 lumbar intervertebral discs from 69 autopsies, lipofuscin was seen in discs from individuals older than 50 years of age and amyloids in the discs of individuals older than 40 years of age. In 261 intervertebral disc tissue specimens collected at the time of surgery for disc herniation, lipofuscin was seen in the discs of individuals older than 20 years of age and amyloids in the discs of individuals older than 15 years of age. It is speculated that amyloids and lipofuscin are a sign of aging in the intervertebral disc as in other tissues. Furthermore, amyloids and lipofuscin were seen in the operated discs of young individuals than in the autopsy cases.
17407150	Age-dependent telomere-shortening is repressed by phosphorylated alpha-tocopherol together with cellular longevity and intracellular oxidative-stress reduction in human brain microvascular endotheliocytes.	longevity, aging	2007-10-15	Cellular life-span of neonatal human brain microvascular endotheliocytes (HBME) was estimated by population doubling levels (PDLs) for serial subcultivations until spontaneous proliferation stoppage, and was 2.4-fold longer for continuous administration with the 6-O-phosphorylated derivative (TocP) of alpha-tocopherol (Toc), being bio-available owing to its water-solubility, or TocP plus 2-O-phosphorylated ascorbate (Asc2P), and 1.3-fold longer with Asc2P, at a dose of 150 microM, than for the non-administered control. Enlarged cell diameters indicative of cellular aging were repressed for TocP-administered cells as analyzed with a channelizer. Age-dependent shortening of telomeric DNA length (291 bp/PDL) was slowed markedly for TocP (165 bp/PDL) or TocP plus Asc2P, but slightly for Asc2P. Telomerase activity as assessed by the PCR-based TRAP method was detectable slightly at younger ages but no longer at middle ages for the non-administered cells, but, for TocP-administered cells, was…
23226360	An investigation of age-related iron deposition using susceptibility weighted imaging.	aging	2012-??-??	AIM: To quantify age-dependent iron deposition changes in healthy subjects using Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI).    MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 143 healthy volunteers were enrolled. All underwent conventional MR and SWI sequences. Subjects were divided into eight groups according to age. Using phase images to quantify iron deposition in the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus, the angle radian value was calculated and compared between groups. ANOVA/Pearson correlation coefficient linear regression analysis and polynomial fitting were performed to analyze the relationship between iron deposition in the head of the caudate nucleus and lenticular nucleus with age.    RESULTS: Iron deposition in the lenticular nucleus increased in individuals aged up to 40 years, but did not change in those aged over 40 years once a peak had been reached. In the head of the caudate nucleus, iron deposition peaked at 60 years (p<0.05). The correlation coefficients for iron dep…
7026617	Decreased sensitivity of old and progeric human fibroblasts to a preparation of factors with insulinlike activity.	lifespan, aging	1981-10-??	To determine whether old cells have a reduced response to a preparation of factors from human plasma with insulinlike activity (ILA), we analyzed the response to ILA of early and late passage human fibroblasts from young, old, and progeric donors in the acute stimulation of [3H]2-deoxy-D-glucose (2dG) uptake and the delayed stimulation of [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation into DNA. The ILA concentration required to produce equivalent, relative stimulation of TdR incorporation was increased two- to three-fold in late passage cells and cells from old and progeric donors (P less than 0.01). 50 and 95% of maximal stimulation (ILA50, ILA95) was achieved by 0.26 +/- 0.07 and 1.38 +/- 0.13 ng insulin equivalents/ml (mean +/- SD) respectively, in cells from young adults at early passage. Corresponding values were 0.54 +/- 0.05 and 2.90 +/- 0.25 in cells from old donors; greater than 0.9 +/- 0.1 and greater than 3.1 +/- 0.1 in cells from a 9-yr-old progeric donor; and 0.4 +/- 0.05 and 1.1 +/- 0…
2498177	Evaluation of whole blood filterability with increasing age in healthy men and women.	aging	????-??-??	Whole blood filterability, expressed as volume of red blood cells filtered per minute (VRBC), was evaluated in 53 healthy men and 56 healthy women; in each sex, subjects were divided into 4 groups according to their age: adult age (20-50 yr.), advanced adult age (51-60 yr); presenile age (61-70 yr.) and senile age (greater than 70 yr.). In addition, plasma fibrinogen, PCV, white cell and platelet total counts were measured and correlated with VRBC. Whole blood filterability and plasma fibrinogen levels were also correlated with age. VRBC and PCV decreased, whereas fibrinogen levels increased with increasing age. VRBC values showed a significant negative correlation with age and plasma fibrinogen values; a significant positive correlation was found between fibrinogen levels and age. No other examined parameter changed with increasing age nor correlated with VRBC values. These findings indicate that with aging there are modifications of some rheological parameters, such as an increase in…
16202481	Age and cholinergic effects on hemodynamics and functional coherence of human hippocampus.	aging	2006-10-??	Aging is normally associated with increased predictability of neurophysiological processes. To test the related prediction of age-related increase in the Hurst exponent, H, of functional MRI time series, and its possible cholinergic mechanisms, two groups of healthy participants (old [mean age = 65 years]; young [mean age = 22 years]; N = 11 per group) were scanned twice at rest, following placebo and a muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine 0.3 mg. Older age was associated with significant increase in H of fMRI time series in bilateral hippocampus. Similarly, scopolamine was associated with increased H in left hippocampus; and there was an age-by-drug interaction in medial temporal lobe whereby older participants specifically had increased H following scopolamine. Scopolamine also enhanced fronto-hippocampal low-frequency coherence, and this could be correlated with its effect on hippocampal H. Thus, increased persistence of hippocampal dynamics in older subjects is demonstrable …
26891153	Cognitive impairment and mortality among the oldest-old Chinese.	longevity	2016-??-??	OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between cognitive impairment status and all-cause mortality among the oldest-old Chinese.    METHODS: A total of 7474 survey participants 80 years of age and above came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey 1998-2012 waves. Baseline cognitive impairment status was assessed using the Chinese version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), with total score ranging from 0 to 30. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to examine the relationship between baseline cognitive impairment status in 1998 and subsequent all-cause mortality during 1998-2012, adjusting for various individual characteristics at baseline.    RESULTS: Compared with those with no or mild cognitive impairment (18 ≤ MMSE score ≤ 30) at baseline, participants with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (0 ≤ MMSE score ≤ 17) were 28% (95% confidence interval = 20%, 37%) more likely to die during the follow-up period from 1998 to 2012. A dose…
30538437	Role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging.	aging	2018-??-??	Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the role of miRNAs in the process of skeletal muscle aging.    Materials and methods: We analyzed the miRNA microarray datasets from 19 young and 17 old skeletal muscle samples by bioinformatic analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, followed by function and pathway enrichment analysis. The expression of miRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis.    Results: A total of 23 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in old muscle samples based on two platforms. Gene targets of upregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in the oxytocin signaling pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, and Notch signaling pathway. The target genes of downregulated miRNAs were significantly related to gap junction, salivary secretion, and estrogen signaling pathway. has-miR-19a and hsa-miR-34a were significant nodes in the miRNA regulatory network. has-miR-19a was closely related t…
20618451	Neuroendocrine-immune interactions in healthy aging.	aging	2011-01-??	AIM: The nervous, endocrine and immune systems are connected by shared neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines. The function of these systems shows patterns of circadian rhythmicity and a number of age-related changes in the 24-h hormonal and non-hormonal rhythms have been found in older human beings. The aim of this study was to evaluate integration among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems in the elderly.    METHODS: Cortisol and melatonin serum levels were measured and lymphocyte subpopulation analyses were performed on blood samples collected every 4 h for 24 h from 15 healthy young-middle-aged subjects (range 36-55 years, mean age±standard error [SE] 44.08±1.76) and 15 healthy old-aged subjects (range 67-79 years, mean age±SE 68.52±1.27).    RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the observed values of CD20 (total B cells higher in young-middle-aged subjects, P=0.02), CD25 (activated T cells with expression of the α-chain of interle…
20560902	Lifestyle impacts on the aging-associated expression of biomarkers of DNA damage and telomere dysfunction in human blood.	aging	2010-08-??	Cellular aging is characterized by telomere shortening, which can lead to uncapping of chromosome ends (telomere dysfunction) and activation of DNA damage responses. There is some evidence that DNA damage accumulates during human aging and that lifestyle factors contribute to the accumulation of DNA damage. Recent studies have identified a set of serum markers that are induced by telomere dysfunction and DNA damage, and these markers showed an increased expression in blood during human aging. Here, we investigated the influence of lifestyle factors (such as exercise, smoking, body mass) on the aging-associated expression of serum markers of DNA damage (CRAMP, EF-1alpha, stathmin, n-acetyl-glucosaminidase and chitinase) in comparison with other described markers of cellular aging (p16(INK4a) upregulation and telomere shortening) in human peripheral blood. The study shows that lifestyle factors have an age-independent impact on the expression level of biomarkers of DNA damage. Smoking an…
9038863	Aging alters calcium regulation of serum concentration of parathyroid hormone in healthy men.	aging	1997-01-??	We examined the effect of aging on the relationship between the concentrations of blood ionized calcium and of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in 22 healthy men [9 elderly (age 74 +/- 2 yr) and 13 young (age 39 +/- 1 yr)] in whom the glomerular filtration rate was > 70 ml/min. Throughout a 24-h period, serum concentrations of PTH in the elderly men were twice those in the young men, whereas blood ionized calcium did not differ between the two groups. With intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate, the minimum PTH concentration was two- to threefold higher in the elderly men. With infusion of NaEDTA. the maximum PTH concentration was 20% higher in the elderly men. The calcium set point for PTH release was higher in the elderly than in the young men (4.71 +/- 0.04 vs. 4.54 +/- 0.03 mg/dl, respectively, P < 0.005). In these healthy men, the age-related increase in serum PTH could not be attributed to a sustained decrease in concentration of either blood ionized calcium or 1,25-hydroxyvita…
24647599	A comparison of oncogene-induced senescence and replicative senescence: implications for tumor suppression and aging.	aging	2014-06-??	Cellular senescence is a stable proliferation arrest associated with an altered secretory pathway, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. However, cellular senescence is initiated by diverse molecular triggers, such as activated oncogenes and shortened telomeres, and is associated with varied and complex physiological endpoints, such as tumor suppression and tissue aging. The extent to which distinct triggers activate divergent modes of senescence that might be associated with different physiological endpoints is largely unknown. To begin to address this, we performed gene expression profiling to compare the senescence programs associated with two different modes of senescence, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and replicative senescence (RS [in part caused by shortened telomeres]). While both OIS and RS are associated with many common changes in gene expression compared to control proliferating cells, they also exhibit substantial differences. These results are discussed in li…
17416609	Rho kinase-mediated local cold-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction is augmented in aged human skin.	aging	2007-07-??	Cutaneous vasoconstriction (VC), a critical thermoregulatory response to cold, is generally impaired with aging. However, the effects of aging on local cooling-induced VC and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We tested whether aged skin exhibits attenuated localized cold-induced VC and whether Rho kinase-mediated cold-induced VC is augmented with age. Skin blood flow was monitored with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) on seven young and seven older subjects. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; LDF/mean arterial pressure) was expressed as percentage change from baseline (%DeltaCVC(base)). In protocol 1, two forearm skin sites were cooled to six temperatures (31.5-19 degrees C) for 10 min each or two temperatures (29 degrees C, 24 degrees C) for 30 min each, with no age differences in the magnitude of VC. In protocol 2, three forearm skin sites were instrumented for intradermal microdialysis and cooled to 24 degrees C for 40 min. During minutes 1-5, there was no age differen…
20507973	Sedentary aging increases resting and exercise-induced intramuscular free radical formation.	aging	2010-08-??	Mitochondrial free radical formation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying degenerative senescence, although human data are lacking. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine if resting and exercise-induced intramuscular free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation is indeed increased across the spectrum of sedentary aging. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis in six young (26 + or - 6 yr) and six aged (71 + or - 6 yr) sedentary males at rest and after maximal knee extensor exercise. Aged tissue exhibited greater (P < 0.05 vs. the young group) electron paramagnetic resonance signal intensity of the mitochondrial ubisemiquinone radical both at rest (+138 + or - 62%) and during exercise (+143 + or - 40%), and this was further complemented by a greater increase in alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone adducts identified as a combination of lipid-derived alkoxyl-alkyl radicals (+295 + or - 96% and +298 + or - 120%). Lipid hydroperoxides were also elevated at r…
3356119	Glipizide pharmacokinetics in young and elderly volunteers.	aging	1988-03-??	The effects of aging on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide were studied. Ten healthy young men (24.9 +/- 1.9 years of age) and 10 healthy older men (74.4 +/- 7.9 years of age) each ingested a single 5-mg tablet of glipizide after an overnight fast. Blood samples were obtained immediately before drug ingestion and at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes and at 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after drug ingestion. Serum samples were assayed for glipizide content by a modified high-pressure liquid chromatographic method. Clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, and half-life were estimated from the serum concentration-time curve data. Area under the concentration-time curve and area under the moments curve were calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The mean values for young and older subjects for time to peak concentration (2.1 versus 2.5 hours), peak concentrations (465 versus 399 micrograms/mL), elimination half-life (4.2 versus 4.0 hours), clearance (38.8 versus 38.1 mL/m…
9745445	Net increase in stimulatory input resulting from a decrease in inhibin B and an increase in activin A may contribute in part to the rise in follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone of aging cycling women.	aging	1998-09-??	Recent studies suggest that an age-related decline in ovarian inhibin B may play a role in the increase in follicular phase FSH in menstrual cycles of older women. Considering that the peripheral feedback regulation of FSH is dictated by the overall tone of inhibins, activins, and follistatins as well as estradiol, it is essential to determine the relative inputs of all of these regulators in assessing whether the collective peripheral input to FSH is one of inhibition or stimulation. To test the hypothesis that changes in the overall tone of peripheral feedback may contribute to this hallmark sign of aging, we compared the concentrations of dimeric inhibin A, inhibin B, activin A, and total and free follistatin in 7 young (mean age, 27.9 +/- 2.6 yr) and 10 older (mean age, 43.6 +/- 0.9 yr) cycling women during the follicular (FOLL; cycle day 6) and midluteal (ML; 7 days post-LH surge) phases of the menstrual cycle. Subjects were preselected on the basis of FOLL phase FSH levels (older…
12548613	Aberrant DNA methylation in pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.	aging	2003-02-01	BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of promoter-associated cystosine-guanine (CpG) islands is an epigenetic modification of DNA frequently observed in adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This epigenetic modification has been associated with gene silencing, malignant transformation, and aging. It is not known whether there are epigenetic differences between pediatric patients and adult patients with ALL.    METHODS: To investigate the methylation characteristics of pediatric patients with ALL and to determine whether DNA methylation can explain prognostic or biologic differences between pediatric and adult patients, the authors analyzed the methylation status of 7 promoter-associated CpG islands in 16 pediatric patients with ALL and compared them with the methylation characteristics of a cohort of adult patients with ALL. The genes analyzed included the estrogen receptor gene (ER), multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), p15, C-ABL, CD10, p16, and p73.    RESULTS: The mean me…
1719051	Age-related changes in mucins from human whole saliva.	aging	1991-10-??	The predominant mucins in human whole saliva, MG1 and MG2, serve to protect and to lubricate the oral cavity. In this study, both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivas were collected from two groups of subjects: young (18-35 years of age) and aged (65-83 years of age). The subjects were in apparent good health. Saliva samples from each subject were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Stains-all, and both MG1 and MG2 were quantitated by video-image densitometry. The protocol gave reproducible values for each mucin. The stimulated and unstimulated salivas from aged subjects showed significant reductions in concentrations of both MG1 and MG2, as quantitated in mucin dye-binding units. Possible associations of these reductions with the aging process are discussed.
21351153	Effects of aging on 5-HT(2A) R binding: a HRRT PET study with and without partial volume corrections.	aging	2011-12-??	OBJECTIVE: We explored whether prior findings of reduction in serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT(2A) R) binding with age could be replicated and whether high resolution research tomography (HRRT) for positron emission tomography could compensate for partial volume effects in the presence of age-related brain atrophy, which has been a traditional concern for radioligand PET studies in the elderly.    METHODS: We derived 5-HT(2A) R nondisplaceable binding potentials (BP(ND) ) in frontal, temporal, anterior-cingulate, insula, caudate and putamen volumes of interest (VOIs) for 28 healthy subjects (mean ± SD age = 43.9 ± 17.0 years, range: 19-78 years) using HRRT. Partial volume correction (PVC) was performed in the VOI analysis.    RESULTS: The 5-HT(2A) R BP(ND) s decreased with age, a relationship best described by an exponential-decay regression. The BP(ND) s were found to be consistent before and after PVC, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.84 and 95% confidence interval = 0.78-…
10051853	Lack of an effect of age on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis in isolated human adipocytes.	aging	1999-02-??	We examined the effect of age on the beta-adrenoceptor response in adipocytes that contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Twelve healthy young and 12 old subjects on a 150 mEq/24 h sodium diet underwent gluteal fat biopsies. Isolated adipocytes from all the subjects were stimulated with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol for glycerol release. In 13 of the subjects (7 young and 6 old), we also performed beta-adrenoceptor binding studies on adipocyte membranes. In addition in eight subjects (four young and four old), we also utilized a competitive binding assay to calculate the percent of beta-adrenoceptors that were of the beta 1 subtype. Our data showed that old subjects, when treated under identical conditions as the young subjects prior to fat biopsy, did not demonstrate any differences in the beta-adrenoceptor stimulated lipolysis. The Vmax of lipolysis was 10.6 +/- 1.4 nmoles glycerol/mg lipid/2 h in the young group and 9.9 +/- 1.1 in the old group. The concentratio…
17635419	Remodeling chromatin for senescence.	aging	2007-08-??	Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferation arrest that contributes to tumor suppression and, perhaps, tissue aging. Senescence is frequently accompanied by an increase in nuclear heterochromatin, which is thought to promote proliferation arrest. In this issue, Medrano and co-workers describe new insights into the protein complexes that regulate these changes in chromatin structure.
7278390	Variations in the stromal cell population of human bone marrow during aging.	aging	1981-01-??	Age-related variations in the stromal cell population of human bone marrow were studied by means of a cloning assay. It was found that these cells are heterogeneous both in division capacity and in morphology. Fibroblast-like progenitor cells could be distinguished from epithelial-like cells, having only a very limited division potential. A significant inverse correlation between the donor age and the number of progenitor cells could be demonstrated. This loss of progenitor cells during aging was compensated by an increase in the number of epithelial-like cells.
21322835	Megalin and androgen receptor gene expression in young and old human skeletal muscle before and after three sequential exercise bouts.	aging	2011-02-??	Androgen signaling occurs primarily via the androgen receptor. Megalin, a low-density lipoprotein endocytic receptor located in various mammalian tissues, has been recently shown to facilitate sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) steroid complexes across cell membranes. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if the megalin gene is expressed in human skeletal muscle and if present to determine how megalin and androgen receptor mRNA expression change in response to sequential exercise bouts with respect to aging. Ten younger (age: 18-25 years) and 10 older (age: 60-75 years) men completed 3 workouts (M, W, F) each consisting of 9 sets of lower-body exercises with 10 repetitions per set at 80% 1 repetition maximum. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were extracted at baseline (T1), 48 hours after workout 1 (T2) and 2 (T3), and 24 hours after workout 3 (T4), and blood samples were collected before and 5 minutes after each workout. Muscle was analyzed for megalin and androgen recept…
10026658	Effects of age and gender on cardiovascular responses to phenylephrine.	aging	1999-01-??	BACKGROUND: The age-associated impairment in left ventricular (LV) systolic function appears to be mostly detectable during exercise or sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that the decline in cardiac function could be unmasked by an acute increase in afterload induced by phenylephrine. We further sought to examine whether the deterioration in cardiac function is influenced by gender.    METHODS: We studied 17 young (20-31 years old) and 21 older healthy subjects (60-75 years old) who were given infusions of incremental doses of phenylephrine following cardiac muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine. Left ventricular systolic function was assessed with 2-D echocardiography.    RESULTS: The young subjects exhibited a paradoxical increase in heart rate in response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, but the older subjects did not (p < .01). The increase in systolic blood pressure in response to phenylephrine was influenced by age and gender (i.e., greater in the younger men and older…
12091401	Photoreactivity of aged human RPE melanosomes: a comparison with lipofuscin.	aging	2002-07-??	PURPOSE: To determine whether aging is accompanied by changes in aerobic photoreactivity of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) melanosomes isolated from human donors of different ages, and to compare the photoreactivity of aged melanosomes with that of RPE lipofuscin.    METHODS: Human RPE pigment granules were isolated from RPE cells pooled into groups according to the age of the donors. Photoreactivity was determined by blue-light-induced oxygen uptake and photogeneration of reactive oxygen species. Short-lived radical intermediates were detected by spin-trapping, hydrogen peroxide by an oxidase electrode, singlet oxygen by cholesterol assay, and lipid hydroperoxides by iodometric assay.    RESULTS: Blue-light photoexcitation of melanosomes resulted in age-related increases in both oxygen uptake and the accumulation of superoxide anion spin adducts. The efficiencies of these processes, however, were still significantly lower than that induced by photoexcited lipofuscin. During irradiat…
12519849	Testicular volume in relation to hormonal indices of gonadal function in community-dwelling elderly men.	aging	2003-01-??	Aging is accompanied by involutional changes in testicular function; limited data suggest a decrease in bilateral testicular volume (BTV). We studied BTV by ultrasonography in relation to serum gonadal hormones in 115 healthy elderly men (median age, 78 yr) and 42 young men (median age, 26.5 yr). Elderly men had a clearly smaller BTV (mean, 20.6 vs. 29.7 ml; P < 0.001), whereas serum inhibin B was slightly but significantly decreased (mean, 176.8 vs. 212.8 ng/liter; P = 0.04); lower values in the elderly were observed for bioavailable (Bio) testosterone (T), Bio 17 beta-estradiol, inhibin B/FSH (mean, 18 vs. 58 ng/mU; P < 0.001), and T/LH ratios. In the elderly and the young, respectively, BTV was associated with inhibin B (r = 0.53, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.01), FSH (r = -0.53, P < 0.001; r = -0.48, P < 0.01), and inhibin B/FSH ratio. Only in the old men was BTV significantly associated with LH (r = -0.32; P < 0.001), Bio T (r = 0.26; P < 0.01), and T/LH (r = 0.48; P < 0.001). In a …
24652877	Independent Living Oldest Old and Their Primary Health Provider: A Mixed Method Examination of the Influence of Patient Personality Characteristics.	aging	2015-10-??	This convergent mixed methods study examined 35 healthy, independent living individuals' (above 85 years) perceptions of their relationship with their primary health provider (PHP) and health practices. The relationship between PHP relationship perceptions and locus of control (LOC), resilience, and self-efficacy was explored through surveys and interviews. The majority indicated they visited their PHP just for preventative care; the number of PHP visits per year was significantly lower than reported for individuals above 85 by the CDC, possible reasons for this finding are provided. A positive relationship between LOC, resiliency, and self-efficacy for the oldest old was found. Few participants indicated their PHP had discussed normal changes with aging. This study has deepened understanding of the complexity inherent to the healthy oldest olds' relationship with their PHP. The findings suggest this relationship relates to the PHP's personal characteristics, the older adult patients' …
26917213	Supportive Family Environments Ameliorate the Link Between Racial Discrimination and Epigenetic Aging: A Replication Across Two Longitudinal Cohorts.	aging	2016-04-??	This study tested the hypothesis that supportive family environments during adolescence buffer exposure to racial discrimination, reducing its impact on biological weathering and its manifestation in cellular aging. Perceived racial discrimination, support in the family environment, and confounder variables were assessed for 3 consecutive years across adolescence in two independent cohorts of African American youth from rural Georgia. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected during young adulthood. Patterns of methylation were used to index the epigenetic ages of these cells and the extent to which they differed from participants' chronological ages. Among youth in supportive family environments, exposure to higher levels of racial discrimination did not forecast greater epigenetic aging. Among youth in less supportive family environments, exposure to higher levels of racial discrimination did forecast greater epigenetic aging. The associations emerged indepe…
1697597	Age-related changes in serum insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins in women.	aging	1990-09-??	Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations are reported to decline with advancing age. Five IGF-binding proteins (IGF-BPs) have recently been characterized in human serum, although their biological role beyond circulatory transport of IGF-I is unknown. We studied plasma IGF-I (by RIA) and serum IGF-BPs (by Western ligand blotting) in healthy elderly (n = 21) and healthy young (n = 22) women to determine if aging alters IGF-I and its high affinity BPs. Plasma IGF-I was significantly lower in the elderly than in the young group (0.78 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.11 U/ml; P less than 0.005). The number and size of IGF-BPs did not differ between age groups, but the IGF-BP binding ratios (binding of one BP fraction/binding of all fractions) for the BP-53 acid-stable complex (41.5K and 38.5K BPs), the 30K IGF-BP, and the 24K IGF-BP were all lower in the elderly than in the young group (P less than 0.01 for each fraction, elderly vs. young). In contrast, the 34K IGF-BP binding rati…
8399462	The effect of age on the level of human ABO blood group antibodies.	aging	1993-06-??	It is generally assumed that cellular and humoral immunity decline in aging humans. Although there have been reports that the naturally-occurring ABO antibodies also decline with age, some of the data are incomplete and others contradictory. Our study involved only healthy women of various ages and included assays of anti-A and anti-B titers in A, B, and O subjects. Statistical analyses of the data showed that while the antibody titers decreased with age, the amount of change was very small relative to the amount of variability among individuals and the variability attributable to blood type and season of the year. Comparisons with a previous study (1) from our laboratory showed that the changes due to aging were also small relative to the variability in titer scores within an individual over the course of a year. Based on this study, we conclude that the decrease in antibody titers with age is of doubtful clinical significance.
26170291	Self-control forecasts better psychosocial outcomes but faster epigenetic aging in low-SES youth.	aging	2015-08-18	There are persistent socioeconomic disparities in many aspects of child development in America. Relative to their affluent peers, children of low socioeconomic status (SES) complete fewer years of education, have a higher prevalence of health problems, and are convicted of more criminal offenses. Based on research indicating that low self-control underlies some of these disparities, policymakers have begun incorporating character-skills training into school curricula and social services. However, emerging data suggest that for low-SES youth, self-control may act as a "double-edged sword," facilitating academic success and psychosocial adjustment, while at the same time undermining physical health. Here, we examine this hypothesis in a five-wave study of 292 African American teenagers from rural Georgia. From ages 17 to 20 y, we assessed SES and self-control annually, along with depressive symptoms, substance use, aggressive behavior, and internalizing problems. At age 22 y, we obtained…
20064786	Interaction of stress, lead burden, and age on cognition in older men: the VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2010-04-??	BACKGROUND: Low-level exposure to lead and to chronic stress may independently influence cognition. However, the modifying potential of psychosocial stress on the neurotoxicity of lead and their combined relationship to aging-associated decline have not been fully examined.    OBJECTIVES: We examined the cross-sectional interaction between stress and lead exposure on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores among 811 participants in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort of older U.S. men.    METHODS: We used two self-reported measures of stress appraisal--a self-report of stress related to their most severe problem and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Indices of lead exposure were blood lead and bone (tibia and patella) lead.    RESULTS: Participants with higher self-reported stress had lower MMSE scores, which were adjusted for age, education, computer experience, English as a first language, smoking, and alcohol intake. In multivariable-adjusted tests for interaction, those with hi…
19359289	Frailty and type of death among older adults in China: prospective cohort study.	longevity	2009-04-09	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between frailty and type of death among the world's largest oldest-old population in China.    DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.    SETTING: 2002 and 2005 waves of the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey carried out in 22 provinces throughout China.    PARTICIPANTS: 13 717 older adults (aged >or=65).    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of death, categorised as being bedridden for fewer than 30 days with or without suffering and being bedridden for 30 or more days with or without suffering.    RESULTS: Multinomial analyses showed that higher levels of frailty significantly increased the relative risk ratios of mortality for all types of death. Of those with the highest levels of frailty, men were most likely to experience 30 or more bedridden days with suffering before death (relative risk ratio 8.70, 95% confidence interval 6.31 to 12.00) and women 30 or more bedridden days with no suffering (11.53, 17.84 to 16.96). Regardless of frailty, cent…
12516719	Age-related changes in the human optic nerve.	aging	2002-12-??	BACKGROUND: Recent morphologic research has demonstrated the presence of nerve fibres of different diameters in the human optic nerve. The purpose of this study was to investigate age-related changes in fibres of the human optic nerve.    METHODS: We studied the left optic nerve of 50 male cadaveric donors, 16 aged 18 to 22 years (mean 20 [standard deviation 1.2] years) and 34 aged 68 to 76 years (mean 72 [standard deviation 1.6] years). The samples were carefully harvested during autopsy from the intracranial portion of the optic nerve. Each nerve was cut into four 4-mm segments. After morphologic, histochemical and immunohistochemical staining, the optic nerve fibres were counted and measured. Each segment was evaluated under light microscopy for microanatomic details, glial cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. The protein content was determined under biochemical analysis. We performed morphometric analysis by examining the optic nerve images quantitatively.    …
2240630	Postoperative hypoxemia after nonabdominal surgery: a frequent event not caused by nitrous oxide.	aging	1990-12-??	We tested whether anesthesia that includes nitrous oxide (N2O) results in the development of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications, including hypoxemia. We also tested whether aging contributes to the development of such complications, particularly when anesthesia includes N2O. We randomly allocated patients having total hip replacements, carotid endarterectomies, or transsphenoidal hypophysectomies (total n = 270) to an anesthetic regimen with and without N2O (stratified within surgical group). A heat-and-moisture exchanger was included in the anesthetic circuit of all patients. Patients were monitored perioperatively and for 1 wk after surgery using intermittent and continuous pulse oximetry to determine oxyhemoglobin saturation. Intraoperatively, mean oxygen (O2) saturations were lower in patients given N2O, particularly older patients. Hypoxemia (O2 saturation less than 86%) developed in five patients receiving N2O and in one receiving O2. This difference was not…
14614361	Impaired spontaneous thrombolytic activity in elderly and in habitual smokers, as measured by a new global thrombosis test.	aging	2003-12-??	We used a new test (the Görög Thrombosis Test) for assessing the effect of aging, smoking and exercise habits on the overall thrombotic status including platelet reactivity and spontaneous thrombolytic activity of 30 healthy young males (mean, 21.1 +/- 0.4 years) and 34 elderly males (64.5 +/- 1.1 years). The occlusion time (OT) and the lysis time (LT) were measured from a single native blood sample. The OT is an index of platelet activation and subsequent occlusive thrombus formation by high shear stress, while the LT is an index of the resumption of blood flow due to thrombolysis. The LTs in the elderly group were significantly longer than in the young group (P < 0.001). The LTs of elderly smokers were significantly longer than those of non-smokers (P < 0.001). Exercise did not affect the LT significantly. Platelet reactivity to shear stress (OT) was not affected either by aging, smoking or exercise habits. Suppressed spontaneous thrombolytic activity in elderly males and smokers cou…
17241767	Aging thyroarytenoid and limb skeletal muscle: lessons in contrast.	aging	2008-07-??	Voice production is vital throughout life because it allows for the communication of basic needs as well as the pursuit and enjoyment of social encounters. Unfortunately, for many older individuals the ability to produce voice is altered. Structural and functional declines in the neuromuscular system occur with aging and likely contribute to the modification of voice. One specific target of the aging process is the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle, the primary muscle of voice production. The objectives of this overview article are to (1) share current findings related to the aging of limb skeletal muscle, (2) identify age-related morphological and physiological features of TA muscle, (3) compare and contrast age-related changes in TA with those in limb skeletal muscle, and (4) describe therapies for reversing sarcopenia in limb muscle and consider the applicability of these therapies for addressing vocal fold atrophy and age-related voice changes. The article shares current knowledge from th…
20483505	Cognitive performance in older males is associated with growth hormone secretion.	aging	2012-03-??	Decreases in GH secretion with age may contribute to cognitive changes associated with aging. We evaluated the relation between GH secretion and cognition in elderly males by assessing correlations between GH secretion and performance on cognitive tests in conjunction with recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. GH secretion of 17 elderly male participants was assessed by a GHRH-GHRP-6 test. Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive function. EEG/ERPs were recorded to assess on-line electrocortical correlates of sensory-cortical processing and selective attention. GH secretion was significantly correlated with target detections and speed of responding in the selection-potential task. Furthermore, GH peak was significantly correlated with the performance letter-digit span test. The present data confirm that cognitive performance in elderly males is associated with GH secretion, with respect to target dete…
2804672	Ontogenesis of monoamine oxidase-A and -B in the human brain frontal cortex.	aging	1989-10-09	The effect of several antemortem and postmortem factors (patients' age, sex, postmortem delay, storage time, laterality and brain weight) on both monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and -B (MAO-B) activity was investigated in the frontal cortex of human brains. The MAO-A activity decreases rapidly during the first two years of life and remains constant thereafter. In contrast, the MAO-B activity keeps unchanged during early childhood and raises during advanced age. These findings seem to be consistent with a genetic regulation and a variation in cell type assembling during brain development and aging.
17317886	Age-associated discrepancy between measured and calculated bioavailable testosterone in men.	aging	2007-04-??	BACKGROUND: Bioavailable testosterone (BT) concentration is considered the best marker for evaluating testicular function in men. The decrease of BT in older men is more pronounced than the decrease in total testosterone because of the parallel increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations. Measurement of BT is therefore crucial for the diagnosis of hypoandrogenism in the aging male population.    METHODS: We compared BT concentrations measured by a specific RIA after ammonium sulfate precipitation (BT(meas)) with those obtained by theoretical calculations (BT(cal)) in plasma samples from 694 young men (14 to 49 years old) and 51 older men (50 to 81 years old). We based theoretical calculations on Vermeulen's simplified mass equation using total testosterone and SHBG concentrations.    RESULTS: BT(cal) and BT(meas) correlated significantly in young (Pearson r = 0.87) and aging (r = 0.89) men, but the BT(cal):BT(meas) ratio differed markedly between the 2 groups (2.28 v…
26999237	Age-related Changes in Energy Intake and Weight in Community-dwelling Middle-aged and Elderly Japanese.	longevity, aging	2016-04-??	OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to describe trends in energy intake and weight change over 12 years according to age at first participation in the study.    DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.    SETTING: The National Institute for Longevity Sciences - Longitudinal Study of Aging (NILS-LSA), a community-based study.    PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 922 men and 879 women who participated in the first study-wave (age 40-79 years) and also participated in at least one study-wave from the second to seventh study-wave. Each study-wave was conducted biennially. For individuals, the entire follow-up period was 12 years.    MEASUREMENTS: Energy intake was calculated from 3-day dietary records with photographs. Weight and height were measured under a fasting state. To estimate linear changes in energy intake and weight over 12 years according to age at first study-wave, we used the mixed-effects model.    RESULTS: Mean (SD) follow-up time and number of study-wave visits were 9.5 (3.7) years …
15585874	Herpesvirus-specific CD8 T cell immunity in old age: cytomegalovirus impairs the response to a coresident EBV infection.	aging	2004-12-15	Aging in humans is associated with increased infections and the reduced proliferative capacity of T cells, part of the more global phenomenon termed immune senescence. The etiology of immune senescence is unknown but the accumulation of virus-specific memory T cells may be a contributory factor. We have examined CD8 T cell responses to two persistent herpesvirus infections, CMV and EBV, and to a recurrent virus infection, influenza, in different age cohorts of healthy donors using HLA-peptide tetramers and intracellular cytokine detection. Of these, CMV appears to be the most immunogenic, with the CD8 T cell response representing over 10% of the CD8 pool in many elderly donors. Interestingly, the effect of age upon EBV-specific responses depends upon donor CMV sero-status. In CMV seropositive donors, the magnitude of the EBV-specific immune response is stable with age, but in CMV seronegative donors, the response to EBV increases significantly with age. By contrast, the influenza-speci…
3440484	Free radical scavenging systems and the effect of peroxide damage in aged human skin fibroblasts.	aging	1987-??-??	One prominent theory of aging postulates an accumulation of cell damage resulting from nonenzymatic chemical reactions between important cellular components and free radicals. Fibroblast lines derived from skin biopsies of psychiatric patients ranging in age from 22 to 70 were evaluated soon after adaptation to culture. No significant correlation was found between donor age and the detoxification enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) or susceptibility to damage by oxygen metabolites as measured by cell viability or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage.
24981045	Is "efficiency" a useful concept in cognitive neuroscience?	aging	2015-02-??	It is common in the cognitive neuroscience literature to explain differences in activation in terms of differences in the "efficiency" of neural function. I argue here that this usage of the concept of efficiency is empty and simply redescribes activation differences rather than providing a useful explanation of them. I examine a number of possible explanations for differential activation in terms of task performance, neuronal computation, neuronal energetics, and network organization. While the concept of "efficiency" is vacuous as it is commonly employed in the neuroimaging literature, an examination of brain development in the context of neural coding, neuroenergetics, and network structure provides a roadmap for future investigation, which is fundamental to an improved understanding of developmental effects and group differences in neuroimaging signals.
16254589	Continuous expression of the homeobox gene Pax6 in the ageing human retina.	lifespan	2007-01-??	PURPOSE: In the past few years, the essential role of the homeobox gene Pax6 for eye development has been demonstrated unambiguously in a variety of species including humans. In humans, Pax6 mutations lead to a variety of ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment. However, little is known about PAX6 expression in the adult human retina. We have therefore investigated PAX6 levels and localization in the human retina at various ages.    METHODS: Adult human eyes of various ages (17-79 years) were obtained from the Zurich Eye Bank. PAX6 expression levels and patterns were analysed by Western blot analysis of total retinal protein and by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections, respectively.    RESULTS: PAX6 expression in the retina was detected up to 79 years of donor age and was predominantly localized to the ganglion cell layer and the inner part of the inner nuclear layer.    CONCLUSIONS: PAX6 remains distinctly expressed throughout the lifespan of the human retina s…
17692536	Aging, grey matter, and blood flow in the anterior cingulate cortex.	aging	2007-10-01	The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to be the neuroanatomical interface between emotion and cognition. Because effective emotion-cognition interactions are essential to optimal decision making, clarifying how the functionality of the ACC changes in older age using functional imaging holds great promise for ultimately understanding what contributes to the psychological changes occurring in late life. However, the interpretation of functional imaging studies is complicated by the fact that aging is associated with changes in grey matter volume and in the cerebral vasculature. In the present study, we obtained high-resolution structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data and quantitative blood flow images to examine the association between aging, blood flow, and grey matter volume in the ACC. Twenty-six healthy individuals between 25 and 79 years of age underwent quantitative [15O]water positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The ACC was traced onto tissue-classified imag…
12498746	Age-related differences in movement representation.	aging	2002-12-??	Repetitive movements have been used as motor activation tasks in the investigation of various neurological disorders. To determine the importance of an age-matched control group in such studies we investigated whether there are significant age-related changes in the pattern of cortical activation seen during simple repetitive movements. Sixteen right-handed healthy subjects were studied-8 young and 8 old. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while subjects performed a motor task or a nonmovement rest condition. Two continuous motor tasks, index finger abduction/adduction and wrist extension/flexion, were performed by each hand, paced using a metronome. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed with SPM '99. For the between-group comparisons, for each motor task, contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and premotor cortex had significantly greater activation in the Young group and caudal supplementary motor area had significantly greater activation in the Old group. Ipsi…
8906001	Immunohistochemical analysis of distribution of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in the postmenopausal endometrium.	aging	1996-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of sex steroid receptors (ER: estrogen receptor; PR: progesterone receptor) in the postmenopausal endometrium (PMEM) and the relationship to clinical data for studying its characters.    METHODS: The immunohistochemical reactivity of the PMEM was studied using monoclonal antibodies against ER and PR, in 33 postmenopausal patients.    RESULTS: The endometrium was thicker in patients who were postmenopausal for 1 to 10 years (1.48 +/- 1.31 mm) than in patients who were postmenopausal for more than 10 years (0.79 +/- 0.37 mm)(p < 0.05). Among the 33 postmenopausal endometrial samples, ER positivity was found in the glands in 26 cases (78.8%) and PR positivity was detected in 18 cases (54.5%). The average age of the patients with ER positive reactivity in the glands (61.69 +/- 7.26 years) was significantly lower than that of the patients with ER negative reactivity (66.00 +/- 3.56 years)(p < 0.05). Furthermore, the endometrial thickness of the patients …
1660842	A lifetime of retinal light exposure does not appear to increase mitochondrial mutations.	aging	1991-12-15	Recently, there have been a number of reports of an accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial (mt) genome with age. Such mutations may be due in part to the mt oxidative metabolic pathways which provide most of the cell's energy, but also generate free radicals. In addition, the mt genome in some tissues, such as the retina, may also accumulate mutations from the effects of ultraviolet light. To obtain information concerning the possible accumulation of retinal mt mutations with age, we cloned retinal mt DNA from a 71-year-old person. Thirty-two kilobases of sequence from 83 independently isolated clones representing two regions, a coding and a noncoding region, of the mt genome were obtained. Three polymorphisms between these sequences and the standard 'Anderson sequence' were discovered. Only one heteroplasmic mutation was found. These results confirm the low somatic mutation rate found in prior studies utilizing different types of human tissues. In addition, these results sugge…
8014388	Time-varying covariates in models of human mortality and aging: multidimensional generalizations of the Gompertz.	aging	1994-07-??	Models of mortality and aging depend on assumptions about physiological change even if they are not made explicit. Standard models, like the Gompertz, often fail to describe mortality at extreme ages, suggesting a need for biologically more detailed and flexible models. One solution is to model the interaction of time-varying covariates with mortality to better describe the age dependence of mortality, test hypotheses about the relation of physiological change and mortality, and use longitudinal data to generalize assumptions about physiological change. This model is applied to (a) a 34-year follow-up of risk factors and mortality and (b) a 9.5-year follow-up of function and mortality from longitudinal surveys of the U.S. elderly population.
8788239	Cytokine production and lymphocyte subpopulations in aged humans. An assessment during nocturnal sleep.	aging	1995-10-13	The view of a general impairment of immune functions associated with aging has been challenged by recent studies including a more detailed evaluation of various cytokines and lymphocyte subsets. In the present human study, effects of age on the production of cytokines by T cells and monocytes were assessed, together with age-dependent changes in subset populations of mononuclear cells (MNC). Blood was collected every 30 min during nocturnal sleep in 16 aged (mean: 79.6 +/- 7.5 years) and in 16 young controls (mean: 24.6 +/- 3.1 years). Nocturnal sleep was chosen as a well-defined period within the 24-h cycle with minimal exogenous influences. The in vitro production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was measured after mitogen stimulation with lipopolisaccharide from E. coli (LPS). Production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was measured after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Regarding MNC subsets, monocytes, …
6177934	Effect of age on the responsiveness of vascular alpha-adrenoceptors in man.	aging	????-??-??	Aging has been reported to alter the responsiveness of beta-receptors, but there have been few comparable studies of alpha-receptors. This study compares in six young and six healthy elderly subjects the haemodynamic effects of the alpha 1 -antagonist prazosin and the pressor responses to the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine. Prazosin orally lowered erect (but not supine) blood pressure in both groups by a similar amount between 2 and 6 h after dosing. Maximal falls in systolic pressure were 19.5 +/- 15.7 and 29.3 +/- 11.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in young and old, respectively. There was a significant difference in the associated heart rate response: in the young group mean heart rate increased to 103 beats/min, but there was no corresponding increase in the elderly group, which has a mean heart rate of 80 beats/min. Following the intravenous infusion of increasing doses of phenylephrine, log dose-response curves were deprived, and the dose required to raise mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg…
10100153	Effect of in vitro aging on the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans by human skin fibroblasts. Modulation by the elastin-laminin receptor.	aging	1999-01-15	The incorporation of a radioactive precursor 3H-glucosamine in glycoconjugates, essentially glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was evaluated in the culture medium and cell fraction of human skin fibroblasts. Using increasing passage numbers, we could estimate the effect of in vitro aging on these biosynthetic activities. The incorporation in different free (hyaluronan) and protein bound (proteoglycans) GAGs was evaluated after specific enzymatic digestion. Most newly synthesized GAGs were excreted in the extracellular medium. Incorporation of the tracer in hyaluronan, the major biosynthetic product, increased with passage number but its titratable concentration decreased with in vitro aging, suggesting a rapid post-synthetic degradation. The proportion of chondroitin sulfates 4 (A) and 6 (C) and heparan sulfate decreased and that of dermatan sulfate increased with increasing passage number. We explored the modulation of these biosynthetic activities by the elastin laminin receptor. Using agonist…
9766260	Effect of acute corticotropin releasing factor on pituitary-adrenocortical responsiveness in elderly women and men.	aging	????-??-??	Aging is related to critical changes of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function. A decline in serum DHEA levels has been demonstrated in healthy elderly subjects, while ACTH and cortisol concentrations remain at normal values. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of aging on pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to hCRF in subjects of both sexes. A group of 12 physically and mentally healthy elderly subjects and a group of 12 young controls of both sexes have been selected. Blood samples were collected before and after i.v. bolus injection of hCRF; ACTH, cortisol and DHEA levels were then determined by RIA. Basal ACTH and cortisol levels did not result statistically different between controls and elderly subjects, while DHEA showed a clear and significant age-related decrease (p < 0.01). Following the hCRF injection, the responses of ACTH, cortisol and DHEA in aged subjects were higher than in young controls; ACTH (p < 0.03) and cortisol (p < 0.01) were higher i…
21408175	Accumulation of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during human aging.	aging	2011-03-07	BACKGROUND: Accumulation of DNA damage leading to adult stem cell exhaustion has been proposed to be a principal mechanism of aging. Here we tested this hypothesis in healthy individuals of different ages by examining unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells matured in their physiological microenvironment.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To asses DNA damage accumulation and repair capacities, γH2AX-foci were examined before and after exposure to ionizing irradiation. Analyzing CD34+ and CD34- stem/progenitor cells we observed an increase of endogenous γH2AX-foci levels with advancing donor age, associated with an age-related decline in telomere length. Using combined immunofluorescence and telomere-fluorescence in-situ hybridization we show that γH2AX-foci co-localize consistently with other repair factors such as pATM, MDC1 and 53BP1, but not significantly with telomeres, strongly supporting the telomere-independent origin for the majority o…
23145530	Cell population-specific expression analysis of human cerebellum.	aging	2012-11-12	BACKGROUND: Interpreting gene expression profiles obtained from heterogeneous samples can be difficult because bulk gene expression measures are not resolved to individual cell populations. We have recently devised Population-Specific Expression Analysis (PSEA), a statistical method that identifies individual cell types expressing genes of interest and achieves quantitative estimates of cell type-specific expression levels. This procedure makes use of marker gene expression and circumvents the need for additional experimental information like tissue composition.    RESULTS: To systematically assess the performance of statistical deconvolution, we applied PSEA to gene expression profiles from cerebellum tissue samples and compared with parallel, experimental separation methods. Owing to the particular histological organization of the cerebellum, we could obtain cellular expression data from in situ hybridization and laser-capture microdissection experiments and successfully validated co…
422668	Superoxide dismutase specific activities in cultured human diploid cells of various donor ages.	lifespan, aging	1979-02-??	It has been postulated that superoxide dismutase (SOD) protects cells from free radical-induced damage. In these experiments SOD specific activity was measured as established human diploid cell lines from various donor ages progressed through their in vitro lifespan. Significant elevations in activity occurred during the in vitro lifespans of cells from fetal and newborn donors, but no change in activity was detected during the lifespan of cells from an adult donor. In addition, a direct relationship between enzyme activity and donor age was detected with the following relative activities: adult greater than newborn greater than fetal. The possible relationship between these findings and the free radical theory of aging is discussed.
16182904	Age-related attenuation of the evening circadian arousal signal in humans.	aging	2005-10-??	The human circadian pacemaker maintains timing and consolidation of sleep-wake behavior by opposing the build-up of homeostatic sleep pressure during the wake episode, particularly in the evening during the 'wake maintenance zone'. We tested whether age-related changes in sleep are a consequence of a weaker circadian arousal signal in the evening. Circadian rhythms and spectral components of the sleep EEG were investigated in 17 young (20-31 year) and 15 older (57-74 year) volunteers under constant posture conditions during a 40-h nap protocol (75/150 min sleep/wake schedule). Quantitative evidence for a weaker circadian arousal signal in aging arose from significantly more sleep occurring during the wake maintenance zone and higher subjective sleepiness ratings in the late afternoon and evening in the older group. In addition, we found a diminished melatonin secretion and a reduced circadian modulation of REM sleep together with less pronounced day-night differences in the lower alpha…
1929958	Antioxidant enzymes in the aging human retinal pigment epithelium.	aging	1991-09-??	The antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase have integral roles in controlling reactive oxygen radicals that can harm cells. In the present study, we quantitated catalase activity in retinal pigment epithelium, retina, iris, and vitreous from human donors. To our knowledge, our results represent the first quantitation of catalase activity in human retinal pigment epithelium and show six-fold greater catalase activity in retinal pigment epithelium than in other ocular tissues analyzed (P less than .0001). To investigate whether aging or macular degeneration affects retinal pigment epithelium catalase or superoxide dismutase activities, we measured enzyme levels in retinal pigment epithelium from donors 50 to 90 years of age with and without evidence of macular degeneration. Superoxide dismutase activity showed no significant correlations with aging or macular degeneration, while catalase activity decreased with age (P less than .02) and macular degeneration (P less than .0…
12470695	Individual differences in memory enhancement by encoding enactment: relationships to adult age and biological factors.	aging	2002-11-??	Numerous studies have demonstrated an age-related decline in episodic memory performance. However, both younger and older adults benefit from various kinds of encoding support, suggesting that memory functioning remains plastic in older age. The present review is concerned with encoding support in the form of enactment. Memory for simple commands is substantially higher if the commands are enacted during encoding than only read/heard. Such memory enhancement has been demonstrated for many age groups and patient groups, suggesting that it is a general effect. Analysis of the results from 1000 participants ranging in age between 35 and 80 years revealed that about 5% of the participants had low memory performance after enacted encoding and showed no enactment effect. The majority of these were older. Comparisons of participants that did or did not show an enactment effect for a select set of biological and neuropsychological factors provided tentative evidence that a failure to benefit f…
18510447	Structural and metabolic correlates of episodic memory in relation to the depth of encoding in normal aging.	aging	2009-02-??	This study set out to establish the relationship between changes in episodic memory retrieval in normal aging on the one hand and gray matter volume and (18)FDG uptake on the other. Structural MRI, resting-state (18)FDG-PET, and an episodic memory task manipulating the depth of encoding and the retention interval were administered to 46 healthy subjects divided into three groups according to their age (young, middle-aged, and elderly adults). Memory decline was found not to be linear in the course of normal aging: Whatever the retention interval, the retrieval of shallowly encoded words was impaired in both the middle-aged and the elderly, whereas the retrieval of deeply encoded words only declined in the elderly. In middle-aged and elderly subjects, the reduced performance in the shallow encoding condition was mainly related to posterior mediotemporal volume and metabolism. By contrast, the impaired retrieval of deeply encoded words in the elderly group was mainly related to frontal a…
11381287	Insulin-mediated blood flow and glucose uptake.	aging	2001-05-??	Normal aging is characterized by resistance to insulin-mediated vasodilation and glucose uptake. The mechanism or mechanisms responsible for resistance to the actions of insulin remain unclear. The majority of insulin-mediated glucose uptake occurs in skeletal muscle. It has recently been demonstrated that insulin increases skeletal muscle blood flow via an endothelium-derived, nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. The authors' investigations of the relation between skeletal muscle blood flow and insulin-mediated glucose uptake in healthy elderly and young subjects are reviewed.
16713997	Effect of L-arginine on asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) or homocysteine-accelerated endothelial cell aging.	aging	2006-07-07	We investigated here the effect of l-arginine on asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) or homocysteine-accelerated endothelial aging. Endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing 70micromol/L arginine until fourteenth passage. ADMA, dl-homocysteine, and l-arginine were replaced every 48h starting at the fourth passage. ADMA or homocysteine inhibited significantly the population doublings (PD) and accelerated the process of aging. Co-incubation with l-arginine enhanced PD, inhibited senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity, and increased telomerase activity. This effect was associated with an increase in NO synthesis and NO synthase protein expression. Furthermore, l-arginine-induced NO formation was accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress and an increase in protein expression and enzyme activity of heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME completely abolished the effect of l-arginine on ADMA or homocysteine-accelerated aging. These findings demonstra…
14667637	Perioperative changes in cerebral blood flow after cardiac surgery: influence of anemia and aging.	aging	2003-12-??	BACKGROUND: Stroke occurs in 2% to 5% and cognitive dysfunction occurs acutely in 60% to 80% of patients early after cardiac surgery. Both may have long-term consequences. Research into mechanisms behind these sequelae has been focused intraoperatively, although there is little reason to believe that injury is limited to this period. Aging prominently increases the incidence of these sequelae. Anemia with cardiac surgery is acute and severe, should cause an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF), and may impact stroke and cognitive function in this setting. To better understand changes in perioperative CBF physiology we have measured changes in CBF and the influence of anemia and aging on these changes.    METHODS: Cerebral blood flow was measured using the noninvasive continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging method. Cerebral blood flow, mean arterial pressure, hemoglobin, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and cardiopulmonary bypass time were recorded in 12 sub…
15642312	Transmission of light to the aging human retina: possible implications for age related macular degeneration.	aging	2004-12-??	The purpose of this study is to determine the transmission properties of the anterior segment of the human eye as a function of age and relate those changes to possible consequences for retinal disorders. For this a new method has been developed. This consists of a probe which is inserted into the posterior sclera and detects light passing through the anterior segment. The probe is connected to a CCD spectrophotometer via a fibre optic bundle. Using this, the transmission properties of human cadaver eyes were determined. A young primate anterior segment has a maximum absorption of 365 nm due to the O-beta-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKG) in the lens. There is a steep increase in transmission of the human anterior segment at wavelengths longer than 400 nm. With aging there is an increase in absorption throughout the visible such that by the sixth decade only 20% of blue light is transmitted to the retina compared to the young primate eye. The rate of decrease of blue light was s…
15040616	Age-related changes in the human retina.	aging	2004-02-??	BACKGROUND: In a previous study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed age-related changes in the rat retina. We carried out a study to evaluate age-related changes in the human retina.    METHODS: Samples of fresh retinal tissue obtained from younger (age 22 years or less) and older (age 66 years or more) donors were studied by means of traditional histologic methods and by SEM. Eight retinas were obtained from four donors whose corneas had been used for transplantation, and four retinas were obtained from four subjects whose eyes had been enucleated owing to injury. All morphologic results were subjected to quantitative analysis of images. The concentration of cytoplasmic (free) and structural (tissue-associated) protein in retinal tissue homogenates was determined by means of biochemical methods.    RESULTS: There was a decrease in all features studied with the exception of structural protein concentration. The mean retinal thickness (and standard error of the mean) was 426 (34.…
9109898	Effects of duration of epilepsy on the uncoupling of metabolism and blood flow in complex partial seizures.	aging	1997-04-??	We derived interhemispheric asymmetry indices (AIs) in interictal glucose uptake and blood flow in the temporal lobes of patients with intractable complex partial seizures from 18F and 15O positron emission tomograms. All patients subsequently underwent either left (n = 16) and right (n = 18) temporal lobectomy. We determined the effects on AIs of clinical seizure variables, including duration of seizure disorder, age at seizure onset, frequency of complex partial seizures, history of secondary generalization, history of febrile seizures, and magnetic resonance imaging evidence for mesial temporal sclerosis. Duration of seizure disorder produced the only significant effects. Degree of interhemispheric asymmetry in both glucose uptake and blood flow increased with duration of seizure disorder. However, the rate of increase in asymmetry was significantly greater for glucose uptake than for blood flow. These results indicate that uncoupling of metabolism and blood flow is a progressive pr…
17077655	Association between meibomian gland changes and aging, sex, or tear function.	aging	2006-07-??	PURPOSE: To study changes in the lid margin and meibomian glands and their association with aging, sex, and tear function.    METHODS: We examined 354 eyes in 177 subjects (76 men and 101 women; 21-93 years; mean age, 63.0 +/- 14.3 years) with no ocular symptoms or ocular surface disorders. Anatomic changes in the lid margin were studied using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Meibomian gland function and morphology were evaluated on the basis of meibum expression and meibography, respectively. Tear function and ocular surface epithelium were assessed with the Schirmer test, by tear film break-up time, and with a fluorescein staining test.    RESULTS: Eyes with abnormal lid margin anatomy, hyposecretion of meibum, and meibomian gland dropout were seen in 26 (7.3%), 46 (12.4%), and 68 eyes (18.6%), respectively, with a significant association between each finding and aging (P = <0.0001, 0.0498, and <0.0001, respectively). In patients < or =69 years of age, no significant association was found be…
19942591	Circulating microparticles and procoagulant activity in elderly patients.	aging	2010-04-??	BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MP) are shed membrane vesicles released from activation or apoptosis of several cell types and carry a procoagulant activity. Age is associated with a procoagulant state, but the role of MP in this setting is unknown, as the relationship of MP to aging in humans. We tested the hypotheses that elderly persons compared with young persons may have different patterns of expression of MP and procoagulant activity in stable or septic conditions.    METHODS: Patients from Emergency and Geriatric Departments were divided into four groups according to their age (< 50 or > or = 75 years old) and the presence of systemic infection (yes or no). The diagnosis of infection was reached when it was classified as certain or possible by an expert panel. Circulating MP were isolated from venous citrated blood. Cytofluorometry using specific antibodies was performed to determine the origins of MP (endothelial microparticles [EMP], red blood cell microparticles, or platelet micr…
23850343	Vitamin K status and cognitive function in healthy older adults.	aging	2013-12-??	Evidence is accumulating that vitamin K could have a role in cognition, especially in aging. Using data from the Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge), a cross-sectional analysis was conducted to examine the associations between vitamin K status, measured as serum phylloquinone concentrations, and performance in verbal and non-verbal episodic memory, executive functions, and speed of processing. The sample included 320 men and women aged 70 to 85 years who were free of cognitive impairment. After adjustment for covariates, higher serum phylloquinone concentration (log-transformed) was associated with better verbal episodic memory performances (F = 2.43, p = 0.048); specifically with the scores (Z-transformed) on the second (β = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.82), third (β = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.06-0.75), and 20-minute delayed (β = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.12-0.82) free recall trials of the RL/RI-16 Free and Cued Recall Task. No associations were found wit…
8959239	Dexamethasone suppression test: corticosteroid receptors regulation in mononuclear leukocytes of young and aged subjects.	aging	1996-10-??	The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is considered an indicator of the function of the adrenal pituitary axis. The effect of the steroid is mediated by its binding to corticosteroid receptors. We previously suggested that the measurement of corticosteroid receptors in lymphocytes is an index of an analogous pattern in brain. In the present study, corticosteroid Type I and Type II receptors in mononuclear leukocytes were measured in 10 elderly subjects and in 9 young adults, before and after overnight DST (1 mg). Receptors were measured by radioreceptor assay. In all the subjects, dexamethasone was able to suppress plasma cortisol. The number of Type I and Type II receptors before the test was lower in elderly subjects than in adults. In the control group, dexamethasone produced a significant depression of Type I receptors (from 267 +/- 72 to 169 +/- 71 receptors per cell), which can be interpreted as a primary involvement of Type I receptors in the response to dexamethasone; Type I…
23301873	Relationship between mean corpuscular volume and cognitive performance in older adults.	aging	2013-01-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and cognitive performance over time.    DESIGN: Longitudinal.    SETTING: Sample from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).    PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred twenty-seven participants from the BLSA (mean age 67, range 50-96).    MEASUREMENTS: Mean corpuscular volume and several other blood indices were measured, including hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, white blood cell count, albumin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Cognitive performance was examined using neuropsychological measures of visual memory, verbal memory, language, attention, executive function, and global mental status.    RESULTS: High MCV levels were significantly associated with lower global mental status even after adjusting for potential confounders. High MCV levels were also significantly associated with high rates of decline on tasks of global mental status, long delay memory, and attention, even a…
12535638	BetaB2-crystallin undergoes extensive truncation during aging in human lenses.	aging	2003-01-31	Based on the present literature, it is unclear whether betaB2-crystallin undergoes age-related truncation in human lenses. To answer this question, the purpose of this study was to determine in vivo truncation of betaB2-crystallin in human lenses during aging by examining its fragments in the beta(H)-crystallin fraction. The WS-protein fraction was isolated from lenses of desired ages and separated by a size-exclusion Agarose A 1.5m column to recover alpha-, beta(H)-, beta(L)-, and gamma-crystallin fractions. The beta(H)-crystallin fractions, isolated from lenses of 24- and 70-year-old donors, were utilized for two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing in the first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension). The partial N-terminal sequences of the desired fragments (Molecular weights [M(r)]<18-19kDa) from a 2D-gel of WS-proteins from lenses of a 70-year-old donor were determined. More than 37 crystallin fragments with M(r) between 4 and 19kDa were obse…
2634561	The effects of VDT work on the regulation of hemodynamics compared with aging.	aging	1989-12-??	Urinary excretions of aldosterone, blood pressure, and heart rate were examined for three age groups of volunteers searching for target words on VDT for two hours. Aldosterone excretion did not change in the young and middle-aged groups, but increased in the elderly group. Blood pressure decreased midway through the work in the young group, and increased during the work in the middle-aged and elderly groups. Aldosterone excretion did not increase during hard-copy work or during VDT work with large letters, but increased during VDT work with small letters. During VDT work with both large and small letters, blood pressure increased. During hard-copy work, neither blood pressure nor heart rate changed, although blood pressure increased after the work. These data suggest that the sympathetic nervous activation represented by the increases in aldosterone excretion and blood pressure occurred definitively during VDT work with small letters under the conditions of this study. It is also sugge…
1823259	Age-related changes of glutathione content, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activity of human erythrocytes.	aging	1991-??-??	1. In order to investigate the effect of aging on the erythrocyte glutathione system, total glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GSH-red) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) levels were measured in erythrocytes from 33 young (mean age = 30.5 +/- 9.7 years) and 28 aged (mean age = 68.9 +/- 11.4 years) healthy individuals. 2. GSH was 3.5 +/- 1.8 microM/g Hb for the young group, a value significantly greater (P less than 0.01) than 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM/g Hb found for the aged group. Similarly, GSH-red activity, 5.5 +/- 1.8 IU/g Hb, was higher (P less than 0.05) for the young group than 3.4 +/- 0.9 IU/g Hb found for the aged group. The GSH-px activity levels for the young group, 21.1 +/- 5.9 IU/g Hb, were significantly greater (P less than 0.01) than 12.0 +/- 3.3 IU/g Hb for the aged group. The lower activity detected in the aged group for all of these parameters of the glutathione redox system was not related to low levels of hematocrit or hemoglobin. 3. There was no statistical differ…
2407314	Age-dependent decline in human brain dopamine D1 and D2 receptors.	aging	1990-02-05	Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor binding was investigated in the caudate nucleus and putamen in 65 individuals ranging from 6 to 93 years of age. [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiroperidol were used as ligands for D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. A full Scatchard analysis with several ligand concentrations was performed yielding Bmax and Kd values. The number of D1 and D2 receptors declined with age both in the caudate nucleus and putamen without any change in the mean dissociation constant. The ratio of D1:D2 receptors remained unchanged. The results show that the dopaminergic system degenerates in the aging striatum and may contribute to the frequent occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms in the elderly.
16603228	SIRT1 stimulation by polyphenols is affected by their stability and metabolism.	lifespan, aging	2006-07-??	Silent information regulator two ortholog 1 (SIRT1) is the human ortholog of the yeast sir2 protein; one of the most important regulators of lifespan extension by caloric restriction in several organisms. Dietary polyphenols, abundant in vegetables, fruits, cereals, wine and tea, were reported to stimulate the deacetylase activity of recombinant SIRT1 protein and could therefore be potential regulators of aging associated processes. However, inconsistent data between effects of polyphenols on the recombinant SIRT1 and on in vivo SIRT1, led us to investigate the influence of (1) stability of polyphenols under experimental conditions and (2) metabolism of polyphenols in human HT29 cells, on stimulation of SIRT1. With an improved SIRT1 deacetylation assay we found three new polyphenolic stimulators. Epigallocatechin galate (EGCg, 1.76-fold), epicatechin galate (ECg, 1.85-fold) and myricetin (3.19-fold) stimulated SIRT1 under stabilizing conditions, whereas without stabilization, these pol…
11950232	Studies on singlet oxygen formation and UVA light-mediated photobleaching of the yellow chromophores in human lenses.	aging	2002-02-??	The protein-bound chromophores, which increase with aging in the human lens, act as UVA sensitizers, producing almost exclusively singlet oxygen in vitro. Direct irradiation of whole, aged human lenses with high intensity UVA light (200 mW cm(-2) for 24 hr), however, failed to produce singlet oxygen damage, as evidenced by the lack of either His or Trp photodestruction. Total homogenates of human lenses prepared in a cuvette under air did show destruction of His and Trp residues by UVA light, but no destruction was seen when equivalent homogenates were prepared under argon. These data are consistent with the idea that the low oxygen levels in the lens prevent singlet oxygen damage in vivo.UVA irradiation of aged human lenses in culture caused an extensive photobleaching of the yellow chromophores. A time course indicated that the photobleaching increased with time, with significant color loss apparent after 6 hr. Homogenization of the irradiated and dark control lenses in 6 M guanidine…
16465305	Repair of mitochondrial DNA in aging and carcinogenesis.	aging	2006-02-??	Mitochondria are responsible for the generation of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. These organelles contain their own genetic material, mitochondrial (mt) DNA. This mtDNA has been hypothesized to play a role in the processes of aging and carcinogenesis. Initial reports have shown that there is no repair of cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers (CPD). More recent reports indicate however, that the mitochondrion contains several defence mechanisms against endogenous or exogenous damaging agents such as ultraviolet radiation or oxidative damage. The role of these defence mechanisms in the removal of mitochondrial DNA damage and the link to aging and carcinogenesis-associated processes are discussed in this review.
23707803	Probing the early development of visual working memory capacity with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.	aging	2014-01-15	Visual working memory (VWM) is a core cognitive system with a highly limited capacity. The present study is the first to examine VWM capacity limits in early development using functional neuroimaging. We recorded optical neuroimaging data while 3- and 4-year-olds completed a change detection task where they detected changes in the shapes of objects after a brief delay. Near-infrared sources and detectors were placed over the following 10-20 positions: F3 and F5 in left frontal cortex, F4 and F6 in right frontal cortex, P3 and P5 in left parietal cortex, and P4 and P6 in right parietal cortex. The first question was whether we would see robust task-specific activation of the frontal-parietal network identified in the adult fMRI literature. This was indeed the case: three left frontal channels and 11 of 12 parietal channels showed a statistically robust difference between the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin following the presentation of the sample array. Moreover,…
2493324	Effect of menopause and aging on serum total and ionized calcium and protein concentrations.	aging	1989-03-??	The effects of menopause and aging on serum total and ionized calcium concentrations were evaluated in 402 healthy women (aged 18-71 years), of whom 83 were premenopausal and 319 postmenopausal. Serum albumin and globulin concentrations and serum pH were also measured in most of these women. Serum total but not ionized calcium concentration increased significantly at menopause. This increase in the protein-bound component of total calcium in postmenopausal women was associated with increases in mean serum globulin concentration (P = 0.03) and in serum pH (P = 0.03). Serum total calcium declined with age within the pre- and postmenopausal groups (r = -0.225, P = 0.04 and r = -0.121, P = 0.03, respectively). This was associated with an age-related decrease in serum albumin concentration in all women (r = -0.47, P less than 0.0001). Neither serum globulin concentration or pH varied with age. Thus, menopause and aging affect serum total, but not ionized calcium concentration.
15959741	Decreases in urine specific gravity and urinary creatinine in elderly women.	aging	2005-07-??	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of aging on urinary levels of creatinine (CR) and urine specific gravity (SG) among women in a large-scale epidemiology survey.    METHODS: Data on CR and SG in urine, together with smoking habits and menopausal status, were selected from previously established databases and combined with the results of supplemental sample collection. In total, CR and SG data were available for 11,090 never-smoking women (total group; 29-80 years of age); a subgroup of 1,851 women who lived in Kyoto was also selected from the total group. Data from the two groups were subjected to statistical analyses. In statistical evaluation, SG was converted to factor G, which was defined as (SG-1.000)x1,000.    RESULTS: Classification by decade of years of age showed that both CR and SG decreased steadily as a function of advancement in age over 30 years, both in the total group and in the Kyoto subgroup, showing high reproducibility of the observation on a whole-country basis and…
12639206	Effect of 1-year oral administration of dehydroepiandrosterone to 60- to 80-year-old individuals on muscle function and cross-sectional area: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.	aging	2003-03-24	BACKGROUND: The age-related decline of dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate ester levels is thought to be related to the development of age-associated usual modifications, such as neuromuscular function impairments. It is often claimed that individuals can enhance their muscular capacity by boosting dehydroepiandrosterone levels through oral supplementation. However, to our knowledge, there have been no controlled studies on a significant number of individuals demonstrating positive effects on the neuromuscular system. This study determines if 1-year administration of a replacement dose of dehydroepiandrosterone, 50 mg/d, orally administered, could have a beneficial influence on several determinants of the muscular function altered during aging.    METHODS: This work was completed within the frame of the DHEAge Study, which was conducted in France from March 1, 1998, to October 31, 1999. It was performed on 280 healthy ambulatory and independent men and women aged 60 to 80 years. The…
16461985	Absence of apparent circadian rhythms of gonadotropins and free alpha-subunit in postmenopausal women: evidence for distinct regulation relative to other hormonal rhythms.	aging	2006-02-??	Aging is associated with a decrease in gonadotropin levels in postmenopausal women (PMW) and is also associated with alterations in a number of circadian rhythms. The goals of this study were to determine the presence of circadian rhythms of gonadotropins and glycoprotein free alpha-subunit (FAS) in young and old PMW. Healthy, euthyroid PMW, ages 45 to 55 years (n = 11) and 70 to 80 years (n = 11), were admitted in the morning to start a 24-h constant routine of light, temperature, position, and activity. Subjects remained awake and semirecumbent for the duration of the study and were fed hourly snacks, and activity was monitored continuously. Blood was sampled every 5 min for two 8-h periods corresponding to the estimated acrophase and nadir of the temperature rhythm. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and FAS were measured in all samples and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and cortisol in 20-min serum pools. Mean LH (p < 0.001), FSH (p < 0.002), and FAS (…
25033025	Circadian clock: linking epigenetics to aging.	aging	2014-06-??	Circadian rhythms are generated by an intrinsic cellular mechanism that controls a large array of physiological and metabolic processes. There is erosion in the robustness of circadian rhythms during aging, and disruption of the clock by genetic ablation of specific genes is associated with aging-related features. Importantly, environmental conditions are thought to modulate the aging process. For example, caloric restriction is a very strong environmental effector capable of delaying aging. Intracellular pathways implicating nutrient sensors, such as SIRTs and mTOR complexes, impinge on cellular and epigenetic mechanisms that control the aging process. Strikingly, accumulating evidences indicate that these pathways are involved in both the modulation of the aging process and the control of the clock. Hence, innovative therapeutic strategies focused at controlling the circadian clock and the nutrient sensing pathways might beneficially influence the negative effects of aging.
16580023	Age-related decline of dopamine synthesis in the living human brain measured by positron emission tomography with L-[beta-11C]DOPA.	aging	2006-07-17	Loss of dopamine synthesis in the striatum with normal human aging has been observed in the postmortem brain. To investigate whether there is age-associated change in dopamine synthesis in the extrastriatal brain regions similar to that in the striatum, positron emission tomography studies with (11)C-labelled l-DOPA were performed on 21 normal healthy male subjects (age range 20-67 years). Decline in the tissue fraction of gray matter per region of interest was also investigated. The overall uptake rate constant for each region of interest was quantified by the Patlak plot method using the occipital cortex as reference region. Regions of interest were set on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, medial temporal cortex, occipital cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, midbrain, caudate nucleus, and putamen. Test-retest analysis indicated good reproducibility of the overall uptake rate constant. Significant age-related declines of dopamine synthesis…
26467819	Elevated pentraxin 3 level at the early stage of exercise training is associated with reduction of arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults.	aging	2016-??-??	Regular exercise improves aging-induced deterioration of arterial stiffness, and is associated with elevated production of pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and anti-inflammatory as well as anti-atherosclerotic effects. However, the time-dependent effect of exercise training on arterial stiffness and PTX3 production remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of the association between the effects of training on the circulating PTX3 level and arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults. Thirty-two healthy Japanese subjects (66.2±1.3 year) were randomly divided into two groups: training (exercise intervention) and sedentary controls. Subjects in the training group completed 8 weeks of aerobic exercise training (60-70% peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) for 45 min, 3 days per week); during the training period, we evaluated plasma PTX3 concentration and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) every 2 wk. cfPWV gradually declined over the 8-week training period, and…
10394077	Gastric mucosal defences in the elderly.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Elderly subjects are more prone to develop gastric injury, but human data on the state of mucosal protective mechanisms are scarce. The aim of the study was to assess gastric mucus and bicarbonate secretion as well as local microcirculation in elderly patients.    METHODS: Fasting gastric juice was collected in 45 elderly patients and in 45 control subjects devoid of endoscopic gastric abnormalities. Total mucoproteins, 'mucoprotective index' (as qualitative expression of mucus secretion) and gastric bicarbonate (Feldman's method) were measured. In addition in 24 elderly patients, and in a matching group of younger subjects, gastric mucosal blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry.    RESULTS: Mucus and bicarbonate production was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in elderly patients, the quality of mucus secretion being unaltered. Gastric mucosal perfusion was also significantly decreased (p < 0. 01) in aged subjects.    CONCLUSION: In the elderly gastric mucosal d…
9804148	Foveal cone photopigment distribution: small alterations associated with macular pigment distribution.	aging	1998-11-??	PURPOSE: To map the photopigment distribution of central foveal cones in healthy adult subjects before potential onset of age-related macular degeneration. To compare alterations in cone photopigment distribution to those of macular pigment and examine those loci for subretinal changes.    METHODS: Eleven healthy subjects (age range, 31-59 years) underwent reflectometry with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. The difference in cone photopigment density in the fovea was mapped for the long-wavelength- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones, using 594-nm light. Macular pigment was mapped with 488-nm and 514-nm light. Subretinal changes were investigated with infrared imaging (830-860 nm).    RESULTS: Most subjects had small alterations in the regularity of their foveal cone photopigment distribution. Alterations were spatially related to macular pigment alterations but not to the presence of subretinal defects. Subjects were classified into three groups according to the type of alterations …
18511735	Predictors of longevity: evidence from the oldest old in China.	longevity	2008-07-??	OBJECTIVES: We investigated the characteristics of the oldest old in China and examined whether the factors associated with longevity varied with advanced age.    METHODS: Drawing from the largest nationally representative longitudinal sample of oldest-old adults, we stratified descriptive statistics separately by gender and urban-rural residence and then used ordered logit models to examine the multivariate factors associated with increasing age-group membership.    RESULTS: Differing combinations of demographic, social, physical, and behavioral factors were significantly related to surviving into later ages for men and women in urban and rural areas. With the exception of rural women, psychological disposition was not associated with increased longevity. Gender differences were generally smaller in urban areas than in rural areas, and urban-rural differences were more pronounced among women than among men.    CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the oldest-old population in China challenge man…
20518188	The concept of multiple hormonal dysregulation.	aging	2010-??-??	Aging process is accompanied by hormonal changes characterized by an imbalance between catabolic hormones that remain stable and anabolic hormones (testosterone, insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), that decrease with age. Despite the multiple hormonal dysregulation occurring with age, the prevalent line of research in the last decades has tried to explain many age-related phenomena as consequence of one single hormonal derangement with disappointing results. In this review we will list the relationship between hormonal anabolic deficiency and frailty and mortality in older population, providing evidence to the notion that multiple hormonal dysregulation rather than change in single anabolic hormone is a powerful marker of poor health status and mortality.
22659988	Diet quality and social support: factors associated with serum carotenoid concentrations among older disabled women (the Women's Health and Aging Study).	aging	2012-??-??	PURPOSE: This study investigated the relationship between social support (including instrumental support, emotional support, social interaction, social space, and family networks) and diet quality, as indicated by serum carotenoid levels.    DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample consisted of participants in the Women's Health and Aging Study with longitudinal carotenoid data (n=325). We performed regression analyses using baseline indicators of social support and changes in social support to determine whether baseline levels and/or change in levels of social support predict changes in serum carotenoid levels. Social support changes were measured over 1 year from baseline to follow-up round 1. Carotenoid level changes were established from follow-up round 1 to round 2. To determine whether or not regression to the mean was driving these results, we performed an analysis that included baseline and change levels of social support indicators.    RESULTS: At baseline, the frequency of leaving one'…
24152296	Relationships between age-related biochemical markers of bone turnover and OPG, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in native Chinese women.	aging	2014-??-??	Osteoprotegerin (OPG), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and TGF-β2 are cytokines closely associated with bone metabolism. However, their association with bone turnover markers in native Chinese women remains unknown. The study aims to investigate the relationship between bone metabolism related cytokines including OPG, TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and bone turnover markers in native Chinese women. The cross-sectional study was conducted on 691 healthy Chinese women (20-80 years old). Levels of OPG, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC), cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (sNTX), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (sCTX), urinary NTX (uNTX), urinary CTX (uCTX) and total urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPD) were determined. The present study showed that OPG and TGF-β2 had positive correlation with BAP, OC, uNTX, uCTX and uDPD, while TGF-β1 showed negative correlation with BAP, OC, sCTX, uNTX and uCTX, and most of th…
16760633	Male aging and hormones: the adrenal cortex.	aging	2005-??-??	The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the aging male (adrenopause) is characterized by an unexplained reduction of DHEA secretion while ACTH and cortisol show no major changes, except for a lower amplitude of 24-h fluctuations and a tendency to higher cortisol values in the evening and night (especially in dementia). As a consequence, the cortisol/DHEAS ratio tends to be higher. Adrenocortical morphology reveals an age-related reduction in the thickness of the zona reticularis, and an increase of microhemorrhagic events. This may be one of the underlying causes of the age-dependent high frequency of adrenal nodules incidentally found in the elderly, which may seldom be hormonally active.
7748532	Calcium regulating hormones in healthy elderly men: relation to intestinal calcium absorption.	aging	1994-12-??	Aged male subjects often have osteoporosis and it has been suggested that the cause is an age-related lack of vitamin D. We evaluated the calcium regulating endocrine mechanism in healthy aged males in order to verify this hypothesis. We studied serum levels of PTH and 1,25(OH)2D in relation to intestinal calcium absorption, radial bone mass density (BMD) and osteocalcin plasma levels in 30 healthy elderly men (61-88 yr.). 1,25(OH)2D levels and calcium absorption, assessed by oral strontium test, did not change with age with respect to a young control group. PTH was higher (p < 0.02) in the elderly than in the control group, and correlated positively with nephrogenous cAMP levels (p < 0.01; r = 0.65). Radial BMD (measured by single photon absorptiometry) was lower (p < 0.01) in elderly than in young subjects and negatively correlated with age (p < 0.01; r = -0.45). Osteocalcin levels, used as a mark of bone turnover, were unchanged. The data suggest that decreased 1,25(OH)2D levels are…
15362965	Interest of the androgen deficiency in aging males (ADAM) questionnaire for the identification of hypogonadism in elderly community-dwelling male volunteers.	aging	2004-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To date, serum free testosterone measurement is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of hypogonadism in elderly males but it is not available to all subjects suspected of a decrease in testicular function. Therefore, we evaluated whether the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (ADAM) questionnaire, in its original or in a modified 'quantitative' version (qADAM), could be used as a surrogate to biochemical determinations for the identification of hypogonadism in elderly males.    METHODS: 5028 men, aged 50-70 years, spontaneously consulting for the assessment of their gonadal function were studied. ADAM and qADAM, allocating a value of 1 point for any positive answer to each of the 10 questions of the ADAM test, were assessed for their ability to discriminate between males with free testosterone levels below or above 70 ng/l.    RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the ADAM score were 81% and 21.6% respectively. The use of ADAM resulted in an appropriate…
19047806	Influence of f-MLP, ACTH(1-24) and CRH on in vitro chemotaxis of monocytes from centenarians.	longevity, aging	2008-??-??	OBJECTIVE: The lifelong exposure to a variety of stressors activates a plethora of defense mechanisms, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which releases neuropeptides affecting the immune responses. Here, we report data on the capability of monocytes from young subjects and centenarians to migrate towards chemotactic stimuli (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, f-MLP; adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone, CRH). Plasma levels of ACTH, CRH and cortisol were measured as an index of ongoing stress response.    METHODS: Monocyte chemotaxis towards f-MLP (10(-8)M), ACTH(1-24) (10(-14) and 10(-8)M) and CRH (10(-14) and 10(-8)M) was evaluated in vitro in young subjects (n = 8, age range 25-35 years) and centenarians (n = 9, age >100 years) and expressed as chemotactic index. In 9 young subjects and 6 centenarians, plasma levels of cortisol, ACTH and CRH were measured.    RESULTS: Monocyte chemotaxis towards f-MLP, ACTH(1-24) and CRH (10(-8)M…
16804373	Age-correlated decline in [3H]tiagabine binding to GAT-1 in human frontal cortex.	aging	2006-06-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In spite of the fact that GABA is a significant transmitter, little is known about the GABA system in aging, compared with other transmitter systems. [(3)H]tiagabine is a ligand for GABAergic neurons, which binds with 10-fold higher affinity to the GABA uptake site than [(3)H]nipecotic acid. The aim of this study was to study the binding of [(3)H]tiagabine to the GABA transporter 1, GAT-1, in human frontal cortex and cingulate cortex from individuals of varying ages.    METHODS: [(3)H]tiagabine binding experiments were conducted on post-mortem brain tissue from 19 individuals (age range 17-78 years) without known neurological or psychiatric disorders. Binding data vs age and postmortem interval was analysed by Pearson correlation.    RESULTS: The density of [(3)H]tiagabine binding to GAT- 1 decreased significantly with increasing age in the frontal cortex, whereas binding affinity was unchanged. No significant alterations in binding parameters were observed in the …
19788893	Differential expression and processing of transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBIp) in the normal human cornea during postnatal development and aging.	aging	2010-01-??	Transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBIp, also named keratoepithelin) is an extracellular matrix protein abundant in the cornea. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression and processing of TGFBIp in the normal human cornea during postnatal development and aging. TGFBIp in corneas from individuals ranging from six months to 86 years of age was detected and quantified by immunoblotting. The level of TGFBIp in the cornea increases about 30% between 6 and 14 years of age, and adult corneas contain 0.7-0.8 microg TGFBIp per mg wet tissue. Two-dimensional (2-D) immunoblots of the corneal extracts showed a characteristic "zig-zag" pattern formed by different lower-molecular mass TGFBIp isoforms (30-60 kDa). However, the relative abundance of the different isoforms was different between infant corneas (<1 year) and the child/adult corneas (>6 years). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data of TGFBIp isoform…
18988735	New melanic pigments in the human brain that accumulate in aging and block environmental toxic metals.	aging	2008-11-11	Neuronal pigments of melanic type were identified in the putamen, cortex, cerebellum, and other major regions of human brain. These pigments consist of granules 30 nm in size, contained in organelles together with lipid droplets, and they accumulate in aging, reaching concentrations as high as 1.5-2.6 microg/mg tissue in major brain regions. These pigments, which we term neuromelanins, contain melanic, lipid, and peptide components. The melanic component is aromatic in structure, contains a stable free radical, and is synthesized from the precursor molecule cysteinyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. This contrasts with neuromelanin of the substantia nigra, where the melanic precursor is cysteinyl-dopamine. These neuronal pigments have some structural similarities to the melanin found in skin. The precursors of lipid components of the neuromelanins are the polyunsaturated lipids present in the surrounding organelles. The synthesis of neuromelanins in the various regions of the human brain is…
9326437	Age and secular trends in bone lead levels in middle-aged and elderly men: three-year longitudinal follow-up in the Normative Aging Study.	aging	1997-10-01	The goal of this study was to examine age and secular trends in bone and blood lead levels of community-exposed men. Bone and blood lead levels were measured twice, with a 3-year interval between measurements, among participants in a longitudinal study of aging. Seventy subjects (mean age = 66 years, age range = 52-83 years) with repeated measurements of bone and blood lead levels were studied. At the first evaluation, geometric mean lead levels in patella, tibia, and blood were 29.1 (standard deviation (SD) 1.8) microg/g, 17.5 (SD 2.0) microg/g, and 6.7 (SD 1.8) microg/dl, respectively. At the second evaluation, these levels were 22.2 (SD 1.8) microg/g, 17.9 (SD 1.7) microg/g, and 5.1 (SD 1.4) microg/dl, respectively. Cross-sectional analysis of each set of measurements indicated that, on average, a 1-year-older individual would have 2.7% and 2.4-3.2% higher levels of lead in patella and tibia, respectively. In contrast to the increasing age trend in cross-sectional analysis, the secu…
19393230	No volume difference of medulla oblongata between young and old Korean people.	aging	2009-06-18	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of aging and gender on the volumes of total brain, brainstem, cerebellum and lateral ventricle of healthy Koreans by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using three-dimensional MRI volumetry, we compared the volumes of various brain regions according to age and gender in 115 healthy Koreans. There were significant differences in the volumes of midbrain, cerebellum and lateral ventricle, whereas those of brainstem and medulla showed no differences between old-age group and young-age group. Men have larger volume of medulla than women. Age-related differences in the volumes of total brain and pons were significantly larger in men than women.
17522352	Age-associated decrease in proteasome content and activities in human dermal fibroblasts: restoration of normal level of proteasome subunits reduces aging markers in fibroblasts from elderly persons.	aging	2007-05-??	We measured proteasome activities and the levels of proteasome subunits in dermal fibroblasts from individuals aged 20-82 years. Proteasome activities changed with age in a biphasic manner, decreasing significantly up to 50 years of age and showing no significant change between 50 and 78 years of age. Similarly, proteasome activities in replicatively senescent dermal fibroblasts showed a passage-dependent biphasic change. We confirmed that the decreases in proteasome activities were accompanied by the accumulation of oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins. The decline in proteasome activities in aging fibroblasts was associated with a decrease in the expression of proteasome subunits. We found that the restoration of the normal level of proteasome catalytic subunits, using a lentivirus gene-delivery system, decreased the severity of the aging markers in dermal fibroblasts from elderly donors. These findings suggest that proteasome malfunction may contribute to the aging process in human s…
20453025	Adipokine concentrations in nonobese women: a study of reproductive aging, body mass index, and menstrual cycle effects.	aging	2010-07-??	OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of reproductive aging, body mass index (BMI), and the menstrual cycle on adiponectin (AD) and leptin concentrations.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison in age- and BMI-matched nonobese volunteers with regular cycles (CO, n = 19) or in early postmenopause (EPM, n = 19), aged 40-52 years, and a young cycling group (CY, n = 21), aged 20-30 years.    MEASURES: Sex steroids, fasting AD, leptin, insulin, glucose, AD/leptin (A/L) ratio, and insulin resistance (IR) by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). In ovulatory women, AD, estradiol (E(2)), and progesterone were assessed weekly across the same menstrual cycle.    RESULTS: Insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, A/L ratio, and leptin values were similar across the three study groups. AD differed, with the highest concentrations in the EPM group (CY: 13.0 +/- 0.9 microg/ml vs. CO: 14.0 +/- 1.1 microg/ml vs. EPM: 17.7 +/- 1.5 microg/ml; p = .05). Values among cycling women were similar. When the cycling groups we…
27713000	Overlapping effects of age on associative memory and the anterior hippocampus from middle to older age.	aging	2017-??-15	The anterior hippocampus has been implicated in associative memory, and along with hippocampal volume, this type of memory declines with age. However, few cross-sectional studies include middle-aged samples, making it unclear at what point these age-related changes occur. In addition, although men and women have been shown to differ in associative memory and rates of age-related hippocampal atrophy, sex-differences in aging are rarely studied. To address these issues, we assessed memory for word-pairs, hippocampal volume and activation during encoding and retrieval, across middle-aged (n=39) and older (n=44) participants, specifically in relation to sex. Older adults showed significantly poorer associative memory compared to middle-aged adults, paralleled by smaller anterior hippocampi and less activation during successful retrieval. The age-by-sex interaction observed in memory performance was also mirrored in the volume and activation of the hippocampus, indicating more pronounced ag…
15014902	A new model for separation between brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in 123I-beta-CIT SPECT measurements: normal values and sex and age dependence.	aging	2004-08-??	123I-beta-CIT is a radioactive ligand for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the pre-synaptic (transporter) re-uptake sites for dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (5HTT), and it is widely used to visualize monoamine turnover. Since 123I-beta-CIT uptake occurs at 5HTT and DAT sites in conjunction with the presence of freely soluble 123I-beta-CIT in brain tissue, adequate separation of these three components is necessary. However, only partial separation is possible with current methods. Two main strategies have previously been used for 123I-beta-CIT component separation, based on the following considerations: (1) the faster uptake rate for 5HTT compared with DAT enables temporal separation by performing 5HTT imaging at 1-2 h and DAT imaging at 20-24 h; (2) blocking the 5HTT re-uptake with citalopram renders 123I-beta-CIT imaging DAT (non-5HTT) specific. In a new analytical model, we combined these two approaches with methods to isolate the passively dissolved 123I-b…
25085608	Age effects on the default mode and control networks in typically developing children.	aging	2014-11-??	BACKGROUND: The investigation of neurodevelopment during late childhood and pre-adolescence has recently attracted a great deal of interest in the field of neuroimaging. One promising topic in this field is the formation of brain networks in healthy subjects. The integration between neural modules characterizes the ability of the network to process information globally. Although many fMRI-based neurodevelopment studies can be found in the literature, the analyses of very large samples (on the order of hundreds of subjects) that focus on the late childhood/pre-adolescence period and resting state fMRI are scarce, and most studies have focused solely on North American and European populations.    AIMS: In this study, we present a descriptive investigation of the developmental formation of the Default Mode Network and the Control Network based on a Brazilian, cross-sectional community sample of 447 typically developing subjects aged 7-15 years old.    METHODS: Resting state fMRI data were…
22901850	Hypoestrogenic "inactive phases" at the start of the menstrual cycle: changes with age and reproductive stage, and relationship to follicular depletion.	aging	2012-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate hypoestrogenic "inactive phases" (IP) in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, with respect to age, reproductive stage, and follicular depletion.    DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively collected menstrual bleed and estrone-3-glucuronide data.    SETTING: Center for Population and Health, Georgetown University.    PATIENT(S): White women (n = 88, aged 25-59 years, mean = 44.7 years) from the population-based Biodemographic Models of Reproductive Aging (BIMORA) project.    INTERVENTION(S): None.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The IP durations by age and reproductive stage. Estimated follicular depletion rate based on IP durations.    RESULT(S): Mean IP duration and variability decreased and then increased with age/reproductive stage. The proportion of very short (≤ 1 day) IP durations increased and then decreased with age/stage. Long IPs occurred most, but not exclusively, in the oldest age/latest stage. Follicular depletion rate estimates were a plausible 2%-…
10455519	Mechanical signaling in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis.	aging	1999-??-??	Estrogen deficiency results in increased bone turnover and net bone loss in rats as well as humans. The respective roles of bone turnover and mechanical strain in mediating estrogen deficiency-induced cancellous bone loss were investigated in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomy resulted in increased bone turnover in long bones. However, cancellous bone was preferentially lost in the metaphysis, a site that experiences low strain energy during normal physical activity. No bone loss was observed in the epiphysis, a site experiencing higher strain energy, despite a similar increase in bone turnover. The role of mechanical strain in maintaining bone balance was investigated by altering the strain history. Mechanical strain was increased or decreased in long bones of ovariectomized rats by treadmill exercise or functional unloading, respectively. Increasing mechanical loading reduced bone loss in the metaphysis. In contrast, decreasing weight bearing accentuated bone loss in the metaphysis and…
22790019	The effect of chronological age on the inflammatory response of human fibroblasts.	aging	2012-09-??	The immune system undergoes profound age-related changes, including a gradual increase in the production and circulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite the known capacity of fibroblasts to produce cytokines, little is known so far about the inflammatory response of fibroblasts to cellular stress such as viral and/or bacterial infection in the context of aging. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the levels of IL6 and IL8 secretion in supernatants of human skin fibroblasts from young and elderly persons. Cytokine and chemokine secretion was analyzed before and after in vitro infection of the cells with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The exposure of fibroblasts to these agents caused inflammatory changes, reflected by the secretion of both the cytokine IL6 and the chemokine IL8 by fibroblasts from young as well as elderly persons. The cytokine/chemokine production induced by either agent alone could be further increased by co-sti…
18243818	Dysregulation of pulsatility in aging IV. Pulsatile signaling and cardiovascular aging: functions and regulation of natriuretic peptide signaling.	aging	2008-07-??	Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are cardiac hormones connecting heart and kidney and playing a key role in hydromineral and hemodynamic homeostasis. In contrast with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, circulating ANP and BNP are not temporally related with rapid eye movement (REM)-nonREM sleep cycles, autonomic activity, or blood pressure. Cardiac natriuretic peptides are secreted in a pulsatile manner, with short periods of 20-48min, in normal as well as in pathological conditions. The frequency of pulses seems to be unchanged with aging, whereas the absolute amplitude of the oscillations seems to increase, most likely as a result of an increase in the plasma hormone levels observed in elderly. Enhanced cardiac secretion and decreased degradation partly explain the higher ANP and BNP concentrations observed in elderly. Despite higher levels, the natriuretic system seems to loose efficiency at the renal site in elderly. This more probably relies on reduced ta…
24259583	Intracortical myelin links with performance variability across the human lifespan: results from T1- and T2-weighted MRI myelin mapping and diffusion tensor imaging.	aging	2013-11-20	Cerebral myelin maturation and aging-related degradation constitute fundamental features of human brain integrity and functioning. Although mostly studied in the white matter, the cerebral cortex contains significant amounts of myelinated axons. However, how intracortical myelin content evolves during development, decays in aging, and links with cognition remain poorly understood. Several studies have shown the potential of mapping myelin in the cortex by use of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity, which show inverse sensitivity to myelin. Here, we characterized cortical myelin in 339 participants 8-83 years of age using a recently introduced T1w/T2w ratio myelin mapping technique and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging. To test for cognitive correlates, we used intraindividual variability (IIV) in performance during a speeded task, a measure recently associated with white matter integrity. The results showed that intracor…
18462819	Correlation between manual muscle strength and interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma levels in elderly community-dwelling women.	aging	????-??-??	Sarcopenia is a loss of muscle mass related to aging and leads to muscle performance decline. An increase in inflammatory mediator levels, especially of IL-6, has been associated to reduced muscle strength in the elderly. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to correlate IL-6 plasma levels with manual muscle strength (MMS) in 63 community-dwelling elderly women. (71.2+/-7.4years). IL-6 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and MMS was measured using the JAMAR dynamometer. Pearson's test was used to explore the relationship between the outcomes at the significance level of alpha=0.05. IL-6 levels (2.56+/-3.44pg/ml) and MMS (22.86+/-4.62kgf) exhibited an inverse correlation (r=-0.2673 and p=0.0373). The increase in IL-6 plasma levels possibly contributed toward the reduction in manual muscle strength among the elderly women studied.
15936178	Functional changes in the activity of brain regions underlying emotion processing in the elderly.	aging	2005-05-30	Aging is associated with a decline in both cognitive and motor abilities that reflects deterioration of underlying brain circuitry. While age-related alterations have also been described in brain regions underlying emotional behavior (e.g., the amygdala), the functional consequence of such changes is less clear. To this end, we used blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore age-related changes in brain regions underlying emotion processing. Twelve young (age <30 years) and 14 elderly subjects (age >60 years) were studied with BOLD fMRI during a paradigm that involved perceptual processing of fearful and threatening stimuli. Consistent with previous reports, direct group comparisons revealed relatively increased BOLD fMRI responses in prefrontal cortical regions, including Broca's area, and relatively decreased responses in the amygdala and posterior fusiform gyri in elderly subjects. Importantly, additional analyses using an elderl…
2903187	Comparison between the effects of aging on antagonist and agonist interactions with beta-adrenergic receptors on human mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocyte membranes.	aging	1988-11-??	Age-related differences in the binding properties of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocyte membranes isolated from healthy individuals have been reported. The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether or not beta receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) membranes showed similar age-related changes. Plasma Percoll gradients were used to isolate PMN and mononuclear leukocyte (MN) cells from blood drawn in the supine position from young (25-34 years) and elderly (60-76 years) healthy volunteers. Both blood pressures and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in the elderly subjects. Saturation analysis with [125I]-(-) iodopindolol (IPIN) showed a 2.5-fold higher density of beta 2 receptors on the MN, but not PMN, membranes from the elderly. Neither the affinities of the receptor for IPIN or the agonist isoproterenol, nor the GTP-induced shift in agonist affinity, differed with subject age in either cell type. These results suggest that subpopulation…
21993163	Differential gene expression of FoxO1, ID1, and ID3 between young and older men and associations with muscle mass and function.	aging	2011-06-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Aging is associated with significant losses of skeletal muscle mass and function. Numerous biochemical molecules have been implicated in the development of these age-related changes, however evidence from human models is sparse. Assessment of transcript expression is useful as it requires minimal tissue and may potentially be used in clinical trials. This study aimed to compare mRNA expression of proteolytic genes in skeletal muscle of young (18-35 yrs) and older (55-75 yrs) men.    METHODS: Muscle tissue was obtained from young (n=14, 21.35±1.03 yrs) and older (n=13, 63.85±1.83 yrs) men using percutaneous biopsy, and transcript expression was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Lower limb muscle mass was assessed using DEXA while concentric peak torque (PT) and power were assessed via isokinetic dynamometer. When age-related differences in mRNA expression were observed, Pearson correlation coefficients were obtained to examine the relationship of…
3584768	Prevalence of anemia and correlation of hemoglobin with age in a geriatric screening clinic population.	aging	1987-07-??	A retrospective review of 1,024 charts of Geriatric Screening Clinic patients was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of anemia and degree of correlation of aging with changes in hemoglobin (Hgb) level in a healthy, elderly population (age range, 60 to 96 years; mean age, 70 years). Twelve per cent of participants were anemic overall, although there was a sex difference; more males (17.7%) were anemic than females (8.4%). Mean Hgb levels did not change significantly with age group except in males over 85 years of age. Pearson Correlation Coefficients were small for age versus Hgb in females (-0.10) as well as in males (-0.21). Likewise, linear regression slopes were small for females (-0.01) and males (-0.04). Based on this set of data, one would not expect a change in Hgb with advancing age in healthy elderly patients.
16760621	The pathway of partial androgen deficiency of aging male.	aging	2005-??-??	The well documented age-related decline in serum testosterone (T) in men as the basis of the partial androgen deficiency of aging male (PADAM) syndrome is a typical multifactorial phenomenon. Aging per se can reduce T secretion through several different mechanisms, such as a primary impairment of the testes, the pituitary gland and the neurohypothalamic component, and age-associated changes in peripheral steroid metabolism. Together, these factors define the so called "idiopathic pathway". Generally, the decline in T is exacerbated by many other age-associated clinical conditions that can interfere with T metabolism: these represent the "secondary pathway". Most people experience a PADAM syndrome in which idiopathic and secondary components are simultaneously present. The different multifactorial pathway mechanisms are reviewed in this paper.
6297941	Biochemical events associated with lymphocyte activation in aging. K+ transport and sensitivity of the Na+-K+ pump to digoxine.	aging	1982-??-??	The present investigation was directed toward answering the question of whether some age-related changes of membrane dependent triggering mechanisms during lymphocyte activation could account for the depressed T cell response to mitogens in aging. For this purpose, the K+ movements were analyzed in PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PHA-PBL) from old humans (O) compared to adult (A). Indeed, plasma membrane Na+, K+, ATPase activation plays an essential role in cell proliferation and results from direct interaction between the loaded mitogen receptor and the enzyme. No difference could be found in the magnitude and the timing of the PHA-induced increase of K+ fluxes between PHA-PBL from O and A despite a higher K+ inflow in unstimulated but 20-hour preincubated PBL from O. Further experiments showed that the lectin-induced triggering mechanism of cation transport resulted from digoxine (DGX: a glycosid cardiotonic) sensitive ATPase. Moreover, whereas PBL from O exhibited a dec…
22205763	Nutrient biomarker patterns, cognitive function, and MRI measures of brain aging.	aging	2012-01-24	OBJECTIVE: To examine the cross-sectional relationship between nutrient status and psychometric and imaging indices of brain health in dementia-free elders.    METHODS: Thirty plasma biomarkers of diet were assayed in the Oregon Brain Aging Study cohort (n = 104). Principal component analysis constructed nutrient biomarker patterns (NBPs) and regression models assessed the relationship of these with cognitive and MRI outcomes.    RESULTS: Mean age was 87 ± 10 years and 62% of subjects were female. Two NBPs associated with more favorable cognitive and MRI measures: one high in plasma vitamins B (B1, B2, B6, folate, and B12), C, D, and E, and another high in plasma marine ω-3 fatty acids. A third pattern characterized by high trans fat was associated with less favorable cognitive function and less total cerebral brain volume. Depression attenuated the relationship between the marine ω-3 pattern and white matter hyperintensity volume.    CONCLUSION: Distinct nutrient biomarker patterns de…
16443361	Physical activity alters antioxidant status in exercising elderly subjects.	aging	2006-07-??	Nutritional adequacy and physical activity are two aspects of a health-promoting lifestyle. Not much is known about antioxidant nutrient requirements for exercising elderly (EE) subjects. The question of whether exercise training alters the status of antioxidant vitamins as well as trace elements in elderly subjects and fails to balance the age-related increase in oxidative stress is addressed in this study. There were 18 EE (68.1+/-3.1 years), 7 sedentary elderly (SE; 70.4+/-5.0 years), 17 exercising young (EY; 31.2+/-7.1 years) and 8 sedentary young (SY; 27.1+/-5.8 years) subjects who completed 7-day food and activity records. Each subject's blood was sampled on Day 8. A similar selenium (Se) status but a higher erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity were found in EE subjects as compared with EY and SE subjects. Blood oxidized glutathione was higher and plasma total thiol was lower in EE subjects as compared with EY subjects. Mean vitamin C (167 vs. 106 mg/day), vitamin…
10100154	Telomere shortening during aging of human osteoblasts in vitro and leukocytes in vivo: lack of excessive telomere loss in osteoporotic patients.	aging	1999-01-15	We have compared the telomere length, as assessed by Southern analysis, of telomere restriction fragments (TRFs) generated by RsaI/HinfI digestion of genomic DNA in: (i) in vitro cultured human trabecular osteoblasts undergoing cellular aging; and (ii) peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) obtained from three groups of women: young (aged 20-26 years, n = 15), elderly (aged 48-85 years, n = 15) and osteoporotic (aged 52-81 years, n = 14). The mean TRF length in human osteoblasts undergoing aging in vitro decreased from an average of 9.32 kilobasepairs (kb) in middle-aged cells to an average of 7.80 kb in old cells. The rate of TRF shortening was about 100 bp per population doubling, which is similar to what has been reported for other cell types, such as human fibroblasts. Furthermore, there was a 30% decline in the total amount of telomeric DNA in senescent osteoblasts as compared with young cells. In the case of PBL, TRF length in the DNA extracted from young women was slightly longer (6.…
7664836	Telomere shortening is associated with cell division in vitro and in vivo.	aging	1995-09-??	In humans, the amount of terminal (TTAGGG)n, telomeric DNA decreases during aging of various somatic cell types in vitro and in vivo. While the factors accounting for telomere shortening have not been thoroughly established, the inability of the DNA replication machinery to completely copy chromosomal termini (the "end replication problem") and the absence in somatic cells of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA de novo, is a likely mechanism. One prediction of this hypothesis is that telomere shortening should be dependent on cell division. Thus we analyzed telomere length in actively dividing and quiescent cells in vitro and in vivo. In circular outgrowths of cultured human diploid fibroblasts (HDF), cells at the outer periphery had a significantly lower mean terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length (P = 0.011) and telomeric signal intensity (P = 0.024) than cells at the center. Also, the rate of telomere shortening over time for HDFs held quiescent was not statist…
21198422	Cystatin C, a marker for successful aging and glomerular filtration rate, is not influenced by inflammation.	aging	2011-04-??	BACKGROUND: The plasma level of cystatin C is a better marker than plasma creatinine for successful aging. It has been assumed that the advantage of cystatin C is not only due to it being a better marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than creatinine, but also because an inflammatory state of a patient induces a raised cystatin C level. However, the observations of an association between cystatin C level and inflammation stem from large cohort studies. The present work concerns the cystatin C levels and degree of inflammation in longitudinal studies of individual subjects without inflammation, who undergo elective surgery.    METHODS: Cystatin C, creatinine, and the inflammatory markers CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin and orosomucoid were measured in plasma samples from 35 patients the day before elective surgery and subsequently during seven consecutive days.    RESULTS: Twenty patients had CRP-levels below 1 mg/L before surgery and low levels of the additional inflammat…
19179832	Interaction of age and specific saliva component output on caries.	aging	2008-12-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between individual salivary components, dental caries and age, utilizing the data from the Oral Health: San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (OH:SALSA).    METHODS: The study population comprised a well-defined stratified sample of 811 dentate men and women. Subjects were divided into four age groups from 35 to 75+ years old. Unstimulated and stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva flow rates, unstimulated and stimulated parotid saliva flow rates, total protein, 6 individual proteins and 4 inorganic constituents were measured. Specific salivary components were lactoferrin, secretory IgA, albumin, lysozyme, mucin, cystatin, K+, Ca2+, Na+ and Cl-. Caries measurements were the DMFT Index for crowns and for roots, Tooth Health Index for crowns and roots, Tooth caries, Root caries and Tooth restoration. The data on saliva components were square root transformed for linearity prior to analysis. Analysis was …
30130776	The Influence of Calcium on the Skin pH and Epidermal Barrier During Aging.	aging	2018-??-??	During aging, the pH of the epidermis goes up and the calcium gradient goes down. Both have negative effects on the protective function of the epidermis and both are connected to each other as is discussed here. In the aging process, the pH rises from ∼5 to ∼5.5-6. The establishment of the skin pH is the joint effort of several independent factors including the activity of sodium-hydrogen antiporters and the presence of lactate, urocanic acid, free fatty acids and melanophores in the outermost layers of the skin. All these elements are under the control of a small ion: calcium. Calcium is organized in the form of a gradient in the epidermis with low concentrations in the stratum basale and peak concentrations in the stratum granulosum. During the aging process, this epidermal gradient collapses. In this chapter, we describe how a drop of calcium in the stratum granulosum affects the expression as well as the activity of proteins and enzymes that are involved in the establishment of the…
1710640	Patterns of glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan immunostaining in human skin during aging.	aging	1991-06-??	Proteoglycans and their component glycosaminoglycans are involved in such cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as cell adhesion and migration, processes that are essential for embryonic and fetal development. As definitive organs such as skin emerge, structurally different proteoglycans partition into highly defined compartments. In skin, these compartments correspond to morphologically and functionally distinct layers. However, during the normal aging process, the relative amounts of structurally distinct proteoglycans apparently varies independently in each of these layers. This was demonstrated, in an indirect immunocytochemical study, through the use of monoclonal antibodies that detect structurally distinct domains in glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. Using samples of normal human skin obtained from individuals ranging in age from 20 weeks of gestation to 98 years of age, we determined that a common distribution pattern existed in skin. The epidermis contained chondroit…
19539768	Modulation of striatal dopamine D1 binding by cognitive processing.	aging	2009-11-01	There is strong evidence that dopamine (DA) is implicated in higher-order cognitive functioning, but it remains controversial whether D1 receptor binding can be modified by cognitive activity. We examined striatal D1 binding potential (BP) in 20 younger (22-30 years) and 20 older (65-75 years) persons who underwent two [(11)C] SCH 23390 PET measurements, one while resting and one while performing a cognitive task taxing inhibitory functioning. The younger persons showed significant task-related BP reductions in sensorimotor, limbic, and associative striatum during cognitive activity compared to rest. Older persons showed no reliable BP reductions in any striatal subregion. These findings demonstrate that D1 receptor binding can be modified by cognitive activity in younger persons, but also provide novel evidence for the notion that human aging is associated not only with lower DA receptor density but also with altered modifiability of the DA system.
2014922	Age-related changes in red blood cell lipids.	aging	1991-04-??	Red blood cell (RBC) lipid composition was investigated in 81 healthy subjects aged twenty to sixty-nine years, having similar dietary habits, and living in the same geographic area in order to search for changes referable to aging. A significant increase in RBC cholesterol and total phospholipid content with aging was found (p less than 0.001), whereas no differences were observed in cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio. Significant increases in palmitic acid 16:0 esterified in phosphatidylcholine and in stearic acid 18:0 esterified in phosphatidylethanolamine (p less than 0.001) were observed with aging. Moreover, a decrease in 18:2 n6 was observed in all three phosphoglyceride fractions investigated (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that modifications in RBC lipid composition occur with aging, possibly causing a reduction of membrane fluidity.
21659340	Myosin heavy chain plasticity in aging skeletal muscle with aerobic exercise training.	aging	2011-08-??	To assess myosin heavy chain (MHC) plasticity in aging skeletal muscle with aerobic exercise training, MHC composition was measured at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level and protein level in mixed-muscle homogenates and single myofibers. Muscle samples were obtained from eight nonexercising women (70 ± 2 years) before and after 12 weeks of training (20-45 minutes of cycle exercise per session at 60%-80% heart rate reserve, three to four sessions per week). Training elevated MHC I mRNA (p < .10) and protein (p < .05) in mixed-muscle (54% ± 4% to 61% ± 2%) and single myofibers (42% ± 4% to 52% ± 3%). The increase in MHC I protein was positively correlated (p < .05) with improvements in whole muscle power. Training resulted in a general downregulation of MHC IIa and IIx at the mRNA and protein levels. The training-induced increase in MHC I protein and mRNA demonstrates the maintenance of skeletal muscle plasticity with aging. Furthermore, these data suggest that a shift toward an oxidative MH…
24287006	Life-long endurance exercise in humans: circulating levels of inflammatory markers and leg muscle size.	aging	????-??-??	Human aging is associated with a loss of skeletal muscle and an increase in circulating inflammatory markers. It is unknown whether endurance training (Tr) can prevent these changes. Therefore we studied 15 old trained (O-Tr) healthy males and, for comparison, 12 old untrained (O-Un), 10 Young-Tr (Y-Tr) and 12 Young-Un (Y-Un). Quadriceps size, VO2 peak, CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and its receptors, suPAR, lipid profile, leucocytes and glucose homeostasis were measured. Tr was associated with an improved insulin profile (p<0.05), and lower leucocyte (p<0.05) and triglyceride levels (p<0.05), independent of age. Aging was associated with poorer glucose control (p<0.05), independent of training. The age-related changes in waist circumference, VO2 peak, cholesterol, LDL, leg muscle size, CRP and IL-6 were counteracted by physical activity (p<0.05). A significant increase in suPAR with age was observed (p<0.05). Most importantly, life-long endurance exercise was associated with a lower level of the i…
11164458	Chemokines, sTNF-Rs and sCD30 serum levels in healthy aged people and centenarians.	aging	2000-12-20	Several lines of evidence point to a profound remodelling of the cytokine network in healthy elderly subjects, with decreased type-1 cytokine production (IL 2) and a shift to type 0 and 2. We have also observed an increase of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) in vitro, and an increase of circulating stem cell factor in vivo. In this setting, we studied changes of chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) with aging, as well as other molecules, namely, sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII, and the soluble form of the CD30 molecule (sCD30), involved in the pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine balance. The subjects enrolled in the study belonged to three different selected healthy groups of young, aged and centenarians. The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was simultaneously assessed. The results show that MCP-1 serum levels were higher in the healthy aged and lowest in the young, while RANTES increased exclusively in centenarians. Only centenarians had autoantibodies…
26054305	Brain activity during source memory retrieval in young, middle-aged and old adults.	aging	2015-08-27	We investigated neurofunctional changes associated with source memory decline across the adult life span using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Young, middle-aged and old adults carried out a natural/artificial judgment of images of common objects that were randomly presented in one of the quadrants of the screen. At retrieval, the images were displayed at the center of the screen and the participants judged whether each image was new or old and, if old, they indicated in which quadrant of the screen the image had originally been presented. Comparing the items associated with correct versus incorrect source judgments revealed that no regions showed greater activity in young adults than in middle-aged adults; however, in young and middle-aged adults the activity in the left hippocampus and left anterior temporal cortex was of greater magnitude than in the older adults. Several regions also exhibited greater activity in young adults than in old adults. These results suggest …
8836126	Aging of phosphylated human acetylcholinesterase: catalytic processes mediated by aromatic and polar residues of the active centre.	aging	1996-09-15	We have examined the effects of 11 substitutions of active centre gorge residues of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) on the rates of phosphonylation by 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methyl-phosphonofluoridate (soman) and the aging of the resulting conjugates. The rates of phosphonylation were reduced to as little as one-seventieth, mainly in mutants of the hydrogen-bond network (Glu-202, Glu-450, Tyr-133). These recombinant enzymes as well as the F338A, W86A, W86F and D74N mutant HuAChEs varied in their resistance to aging (15-3300-fold relative to the wild type). The most dramatic resistance to aging was observed for the phosphonyl conjugate of the mutant W86A enzyme (1850-3300-fold relative to the wild type). It is proposed that Trp-86 contributes to the aging process by stabilizing the evolving carbonium ion on the 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl moiety, via charge-pi interaction. The rate-enhancing effect of Trp-86 provides a rationale for the unique facility of aging in soman-inhibited cholinest…
25351642	Trends in food consumption over 30 years: evidence from a British birth cohort.	aging	2015-07-??	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: As populations are ageing, more emphasis is placed on healthy ageing. Over the past decades, food consumption patterns and food availability have also changed drastically, and therefore this study aimed to describe these changes in an ageing population.    SUBJECTS/METHODS: Food consumption of participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey on Health and Development, a British birth cohort study, was assessed using a 5-day estimated food records at 60-64 years (2006-11), 53 years (1999), 43 years (1989) and 36 years (1982). Only those who recorded ⩾3 days at all four time points were included in the analyses, n=989 (n=438 men and n=551 women); trends were tested using the Friedman test.    RESULTS: Consumption of white bread, whole milk, fats and oils, meat and meat products, alcoholic drinks, coffee, sugar, preserves and confectionery decreased (P<0.001), whereas consumption of wholemeal and granary bread, semi-skimmed milk, fish and fruit and veg…
18667023	Increased levels of a particular phosphatidylcholine species in senescent human dermal fibroblasts in vitro.	aging	2008-08-??	Plasma membranes are essential components of living cells, and phospholipids are major components of cellular membranes. Here, we used liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to investigate changes in the membrane phospholipid content that occur in association with aging. Our results indicate that the levels of a particular species of phosphatidylcholine comprised of stearic acid and arachidonic acid increased with age. To determine the reason for the increased levels of this particular phosphatidylcholine, we examined the effect of highly unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, on cellular aging. Applied arachidonic acid was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine molecules, but neither arachidonic acid nor other related unsaturated fatty acids had any effect. We conclude that increased levels of this distinctive phosphatidylcholine are a result of in vitro senescence.
1407753	Nutrition and aging: potentials and problems for research in developing countries.	aging	1992-08-??	The demographic explosion of persons over 60 years of age is a reality in developed and developing countries alike. There is evidence that research on aging and nutrition in Third World countries is growing and developing. Specific research programs, and the linking of these programs in timely multicenter efforts, promise both valuable descriptive research for the benefit of national populations and comparative insights that will help us to learn more, collectively, about the intrinsic nature of the aging process itself.
23929093	Cell senescence culturing methods.	aging	2013-??-??	Development of therapeutic approaches that slow or ablate the adverse physiological and pathological changes associated with aging has been considered as an important goal for gerontological research. As cellular senescence is characterized as the basis for aging in organisms, culturing and subculturing of normal human diploid fibroblasts to mimic the in vivo aging processes have been developed as major methods to investigate molecular events involved in aging. It has been established that normal human diploid fibroblasts can proliferate in culture for only finite periods of time. There are many ways to study aging in vitro. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the basic laboratory procedures for cell senescence culturing methods.
21576928	Immunosenescence of human natural killer cells.	aging	2011-??-??	Natural killer (NK) cells are a key component of innate immunity involved not only in the elimination of virus-infected or tumor cells but also in the regulation of the immune response by producing cytokines and chemokines that can activate other cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity. NK cell subsets are differentially affected by aging. Whereas CD56(bright) cells are decreased in healthy elderly individuals, the CD56(dim) subset is expanded. The expression of CD57, a marker of highly differentiated NK cells, is increased in the elderly; this supports the notion that a remodeling process of NK cell subsets occurs in aging with a gradual decrease in more immature CD56(bright) NK cells and an increase in highly differentiated CD56(dim) CD57+ NK cells. This NK cell redistribution can explain many of the phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells associated with healthy aging such as decreased proliferation and the maintenance of CD16-dependent cytotoxicity.
22936730	Unchanged [3H]ouabain binding site content but reduced Na+-K+ pump α2-protein abundance in skeletal muscle in older adults.	aging	2012-11-??	Aging is associated with reduced muscle mass, weakness, and increased fatigability. In skeletal muscle, the Na(+)-K(+) pump (NKA) is important in regulating Na(+)-K(+) gradients, membrane excitability, and thus contractility, but the effects of aging on muscle NKA are unclear. We investigated whether aging is linked with reduced muscle NKA by contrasting muscle NKA isoform gene expression and protein abundance, and NKA total content in 17 Elderly (66.8 ± 6.4 yr, mean ± SD) and 16 Young adults (23.9 ± 2.2 yr). Participants underwent peak oxygen consumption assessment and a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy, which was analyzed for NKA α(1)-, α(2)-, α(3)-, β(1)-, β(2)-, and β(3)-isoform gene expression (real-time RT-PCR), protein abundance (immunoblotting), and NKA total content ([(3)H]ouabain binding sites). The Elderly had lower peak oxygen consumption (-36.7%, P = 0.000), strength (-36.3%, P = 0.001), NKA α(2)- (-24.4%, 11.9 ± 4.4 vs. 9.0 ± 2.7 arbitrary units, P = 0.049), and NKA β(3)-pr…
27784627	The neural bases of proactive and reactive control processes in normal aging.	aging	2017-??-01	INTRODUCTION: Research on cognitive control suggests an age-related decline in proactive control abilities (anticipatory control), whereas reactive control (following conflict detection) seems to remain intact. As proactive and reactive control abilities are associated with specific brain networks, this study investigated age-related effects on the neural substrates associated with each kind of control.    METHODS: In an event-related fMRI study, a modified version of the Stroop task was administered to groups of 20 young and 20 older healthy adults. Based on the theory of dual mechanisms of control, the Stroop task has been built to induce proactive or reactive control depending on task context.    RESULTS: Behavioral results (p<0.05) indicated faster processing of interfering items in the mostly incongruent (MI) than the mostly congruent (MC) context in both young and older participants. fMRI results showed that reactive control is associated with increased activity in left frontal a…
8120050	Nuclear but not mitochondrial genome involvement in human age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Functional integrity of mitochondrial DNA from aged subjects.	aging	1994-03-04	The role of mtDNA and nuclear genome in human aging was examined by their intercellular transfer using skin fibroblasts and mtDNA-less HeLa cells (rho o-HeLa cells). We found in vivo age-related reductions in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in human skin fibroblasts obtained from 16 donors of various ages (0-97 years). The abnormality in mitochondria of the aged donors was not attributable to either decrease in the copy number of mtDNA molecules or increase in the copy number of deletion mutant mtDNA molecules, but to significant decrease in overall polypeptide synthesis in the mitochondria. However, intercellular mtDNA transfer experiments showed that fibroblast mtDNA from elderly donors is functionally intact. By contrast, intercellular transfer of HeLa nuclei to fibroblasts from aged donors restored cytochrome c oxidase activity, suggesting that the age-related phenotype was nuclear recessive. However, during subsequent cultivation of these hybrids, the activity gradually reduc…
9522349	Transcranial cerebral oximetry in random normal subjects.	aging	1998-03-??	Near infrared optical spectroscopy is becoming a useful method for monitoring regional cerebral oxygenation status. The method is simple, reliable and noninvasive and the information which it provides is clinically significant in managing a growing number of neurological ailments. Use of this technique has been described previously by numerous authors. In the present study, regional cerebral oxygen saturation was measured at rest in 94 subjects randomly selected from a diverse population of individuals. This sample consisted of 38 males and 65 females (age range 18-70 years). There were 68 light-skinned individuals and 35 with darker skin comprising various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Mean regional cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation was recorded as 67.14 +/- 8.84%. The association of the man regional cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation in various groups of individuals with relationship to their age, race, sex and skin color is examined.
16315237	Ki67 and doublecortin positive cells in the human prefrontal cortices of normal aging and vascular dementia.	aging	2005-12-01	Immunohistochemical localizing of the proliferation of Ki67 nuclei and doublecortin positive cells were performed in the prefrontal cortex of normal aged and vascular dementia (multiple infarct dementia) patients. Positive Ki67 nuclei and doublecortin positive cells were observed in both groups, with slightly higher density in the prefrontal cortex of vascular dementia. When the Ki67 sites were superimposed with the neuronal specific enolase localizations, only about 5% of the cells was doubly labeled, indicating few proliferating cells were neurons. This percentage did not vary between specimens of normal aging and those of vascular dementia.
12110533	Interrelationships of serum testosterone and free testosterone index with FFM and strength in aging men.	aging	2002-08-??	Muscle mass and strength losses during aging may be associated with declining levels of serum testosterone (T) in men. Few studies have shown a direct relationship between T and muscle mass and strength. Subjects were 262 men, aged 24-90 yr, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who had T and sex hormone-binding globulin sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) measurements, from which the free T index (FTI) was calculated (T/SHBG) from serum samples collected longitudinally since 1963, total body fat mass and arm and leg fat-free mass (FFM) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and arm and leg strength by dynanomometry. Mixed-effects models estimated T and FTI at the time of mass and strength measurements. Age, total body fat, arm and leg FFM, T, and FTI were significantly associated with concentric and eccentric strength. FTI, not T, was modestly, but directly, related to arm and leg strength after fat, arm and leg FFM, height, and age were accounted for and indirectly through bod…
10476804	TIMP-3 in Bruch's membrane: changes during aging and in age-related macular degeneration.	aging	1999-09-??	PURPOSE: To assess the distribution, content, and function of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3 during aging in normal eyes for comparison with the levels observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).    METHODS: Donor tissues analyzed included 36 normal eyes (14-96 years old) and 15 AMD eyes (74 -98 years old). A tissue strip including the fovea was used for immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis was performed on extracts of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)- choroid complex from the posterior part of each eye. Immunoreactivity of TIMP-3 bands in each western blot was densitometrically quantitated. The inhibitory function of TIMP-3 was evaluated with reverse zymography.    RESULTS: TIMP-3 was present uniformly across Bruch's membrane in the normal samples. In samples from donors more than 50 years of age, immunostaining was intense. TIMP-3 content ranged from 92 to 1061 ng/cm2 and increased with age (r = 0.66). In AMD eyes, TIMP-3 distribution in …
9562359	Acute hormone responses to heavy resistance lower and upper extremity exercise in young versus old men.	aging	1998-03-??	Acute hormone responses of growth hormone (GH), total and free testosterone (TT and FT) and cortisol (C) to heavy resistance isometric exercise were examined in ten young men [YM 26.5 (SD 4.8) years] and ten old men [OM 70.0 (SD 3.7) years]. Loading conditions of the same relative intensity were created for the lower and upper extremity actions separately as well as for both of them together lower extremity exercise (LE; knee extension), upper extremity exercise (UE; bench press extension), and lower and upper extremity exercise (LUE) performed simultaneously in a seated position. Single voluntary maximal isometric actions lasting for 5 s were performed repeatedly for ten repetitions (with a recovery of 5 s) for a total of four sets. The recovery time between the sets was 1 min. Each exercise led to large acute decreases in maximal isometric force in both YM (P < 0.001) and OM (P < 0.001) ranging from 41% to 26% with no significant differences between the groups. Serum GH concentration…
22015314	Age-related changes in the topological architecture of the brain during hand grip.	aging	2012-04-??	Neuroanatomical changes in the aging brain are widely distributed rather than focal. We investigated age-related changes in large-scale functional brain networks by applying graph theory to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during a simple grip task with either dominant or nondominant hand. We measured the effect of age on efficiency of information transfer within a series of hierarchical functional networks composed of the whole brain or component parts of the whole brain. Global efficiency was maintained with aging during dominant hand use, primarily due to increased efficiency in parietal-occipital-cerebellar-related networks. During nondominant hand use, global efficiency, as well as efficiency within ipsilateral hemisphere and between hemispheres declined with age. This was attributable largely to frontal-temporal-limbic-cerebellar-related networks. Increased efficiency with age was seen in networks involving parietal-occipital regions, but unlike for dominant ha…
17653956	The relative contributions of menopause and aging to postmenopausal reduction in intervertebral disk height.	aging	2007-08-??	AIM: To evaluate, in a population of normal women, the effects of aging and menopause on the height of intervertebral discs by measuring the intervertebral disk space, between the 12th thoracic and 4th lumbar vertebrae, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 2455 consecutive women attending our Department, from whom 464 normal women were selected. The measurement was validated utilizing a spine phantom.    RESULTS: The phantom mean intervertebral disk space was 0.44 cm, with a coefficient of variation of 1.4%. The coefficients of variation in premenopausal, early postmenopausal and elderly women were 2.2, 2.0 and 6.0%, respectively. Values of intervertebral disk space were stable from age 20 to 50 years, thereafter showing a significant (p < 0.05) decrease, negatively correlated with both age and years since menopause (p < 0.0001). In postmenopausal women younger than 60 years, a correlation (p = 0.042) was evident between interv…
6182504	Aging, senile dementia, and the intralaminar microchemistry of cerebral cortex.	aging	1982-11-??	We compared the microchemical architecture or right frontal isocortex from patients with senile dementia and age-matched and younger controls. Neuronal connectivity within deep lamina of the cortical column (Brodmann area 9) tended to decline in normal aging and was profoundly depleted in senile dementia. In both aging and senile dementia, there was a significant 20% loss of total cells (neurons and glia) in cortical layers III to VI. In senile dementia, marked diminution of total ganglioside sialic acid per neuron and galactocerebroside per cell in the lower lamina far exceeded alterations associated with aging itself. This structural loss may imply deafferentation of the cortex, owing to loss of projections from subcortical areas such as nucleus basalis. Selective vulnerability of axodendritic arborization of neurons in lower lamina may be correlated to the impaired cognitive functions of senile dementia.
18095284	When do infants differentiate profile face from frontal face? A near-infrared spectroscopic study.	aging	2009-02-??	The objective of the present study was to determine whether a developmental difference occurs in brain activity when infants look at frontal and profile views using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which is an optical imaging technique used to measure changes in the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), and total hemoglobin (total-Hb). For this objective, we compared NIRS results in two age groups, 5- and 8-month-old infants, while they were looking at frontal views, profile views, and objects. We found that the concentration of oxy-Hb and total-Hb in the 5-month-old group increased for only frontal views in the right temporal regions. In contrast, the concentration of oxy-Hb and total-Hb in the 8-month-old group increased for both frontal and profile views in the right temporal regions. Therefore, the present study indicated that the right hemisphere was dominant for the perception of profile views as well as frontal views. In addition, the most impor…
10623889	Aging-dependent proteolysis of NF-kappaB in human fibroblasts.	aging	2000-02-??	We investigated the NF-kappaB-like factor induced in the late-passage human oral mucosal fibroblasts stimulated with interleukin-1 (IL-1). Compared with the NF-kappaBs of HeLa cells and early-passage fibroblasts, the NF-kappaB-like factor of late-passage (passage 15) fibroblasts migrated faster in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and behaved like a 70-80 kDa protein in the gel filtration chromatography. Both antibodies against p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB could supershift the small NF-kappaB-like factor of late-passage cells in the EMSAs. A 47-kDa band was detected in late-passage fibroblasts by immunoblotting against p50. The mobility of the trypsin-degraded NF-kappaB of HeLa cells corresponded to that of the small NF-kappaB-like factor of late-passage fibroblasts in the EMSAs. Furthermore, when the nuclear extracts of the IL-1-stimulated HeLa cells were incubated with those of the IL-1-stimulated old fibroblasts, the p65-p50 NF-kappaB band disappeared, leaving beh…
28534294	Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Expression in Individuals With Schizophrenia and Healthy Aging: Testing the Accelerated Aging Hypothesis of Schizophrenia.	aging	2017-07-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be a syndrome of accelerated aging. Brain plasticity is vulnerable to the normal aging process and affected in schizophrenia: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important neuroplasticity molecule. The present review explores the accelerated aging hypothesis of schizophrenia by comparing changes in BDNF expression in schizophrenia with aging-associated changes.    RECENT FINDINGS: Individuals with schizophrenia show patterns of increased overall mortality, metabolic abnormalities, and cognitive decline normally observed later in life in the healthy population. An overall decrease is observed in BDNF expression in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls and in older individuals compared to a younger cohort. There is a marked decrease in BDNF levels in the frontal regions and in the periphery among older individuals and those with schizophrenia; however, data for BDNF expression in the occipital, parietal, and tempor…
21613572	Long-term synthesis rates of skeletal muscle DNA and protein are higher during aerobic training in older humans than in sedentary young subjects but are not altered by protein supplementation.	aging	2011-09-??	Consuming protein following exercise has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis acutely in skeletal muscle and has been recommended to prevent sarcopenia. It is not known, however, whether acute stimulation persists long term or includes muscle cell division. We asked here whether consuming protein following exercise during aerobic training increases long-term protein and DNA synthesis rates in skeletal muscle of adult humans. Sixteen previously untrained participants (50 ± 8 yr) consumed either a carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein drink following each session during 6 wk of treadmill training. A younger untrained group provided a nonexercising comparison. Participants were administered heavy water (²H₂O; deuterium oxide) continuously for 6 wk to isotopically label newly synthesized skeletal muscle proteins and DNA. Muscle biopsies were performed after 6 wk of training. Contrary to acute studies, consuming protein after exercise did not increase skeletal muscle protein synthes…
17764865	Neuroendocrine features in extreme longevity.	aging	2008-02-??	In order to evaluate the effects of some neuro-endocrine changes during aging we have studied adrenal, thyroid and pineal secretion in young, healthy old and centenarians. The number of subjects in each hormone group varied. The following parameters were evaluated: serum levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroxine (FT4), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (aMT6s) and free cortisol were measured twice daily. Centenarians exhibited significantly lower TSH levels together with slightly higher rT3 levels than old controls. These changes could be due to reduced 5'-deiodinase activity occurring also in absence of substantial changes of the nutritional pattern. Morning serum cortisol levels were found to be similar in the 3 age groups, whereas the decline of serum DHEAS levels was well evident also after the ninth decade of life. The cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio, which us…
27658542	Body mass and cognitive decline are indirectly associated via inflammation among aging adults.	aging	2017-02-??	Inflammatory models of neurodegeneration suggest that higher circulating levels of inflammation can lead to cognitive decline. Despite established independent associations between greater body mass, increased inflammation, and cognitive decline, no prior research has explored whether markers of systemic inflammation might mediate the association between body mass and changes in cognitive functioning. To test such a model, we used two longitudinal subsamples (ns=9066; 12,561) of aging adults from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) study, which included two cognitive measures components of memory and executive functioning, as well as measurements of body mass and systemic inflammation, assessed via C-reactive protein (CRP). Greater body mass was indirectly associated with declines in memory and executive functioning over 6years via relatively higher levels of CRP. Our results suggest that systemic inflammation is one biologically plausible mechanism through which differences…
22030267	Gender differences in nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation are present at young-to-middle but not at older age in normal adults.	aging	2012-01-??	Gender differences in brain dopaminergic activity have been variably reported in the literature. We performed an evaluation for gender effects on striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding in a group of normal subjects. Community-dwelling adults (n = 85, 50F/35M, mean age 62.7 ± 16.2 SD, range 20-85) underwent DAT [(11)C]2-β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (β-CFT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Gender effects for DAT binding were compared using ANCOVA for two subgroups; young-to-middle aged adults and older adults, using an age threshold of 60 years. There were 54 subjects (24M/30F; mean age 72.9 ± 7.3) 60 years and older and 31 (11M/20F; mean age 45.0 ± 11.4) subjects younger than 60. Age-adjusted striatal DAT gender effects were present in the young-to-middle (F = 10.4, P = 0.003) but not in the elderly age group (F = 0.5, ns). Gender differences in nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation are present, with higher levels of DAT binding in young-to-middle age wome…
19549740	Aging attenuates the pituitary response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone.	aging	2009-09-??	CONTEXT: Complex changes in GnRH secretion occur with aging in women, but little is known about the effect of aging on the pituitary per se.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether pituitary responsiveness to GnRH is attenuated with aging.    DESIGN AND SETTING: A GnRH antagonist and graded doses of GnRH were used to isolate pituitary responsiveness in Clinical Research Center studies at an academic medical center.    SUBJECTS: Subjects were healthy postmenopausal women (PMW) aged 48-57 yr (n = 10) or 70-77 yr (n= 9).    INTERVENTIONS: A suppressive dose of the NAL-GLU GnRH antagonist (150 microg/kg sc) was administered and was followed by GnRH doses of 25, 75, 250, or 750 ng/kg iv every 4 h.    RESULTS: The LH response to GnRH was attenuated with aging (P = 0.05) with an interaction between age and dose (P = 0.01) such that the LH amplitude was less in older PMW at the higher doses (250 ng/kg, 50 +/- 9 vs. 29 +/- 4.9 IU/liter, for young and old PMW, respectively, P…
21369667	Do the effects of APOE-ε4 on cognitive function and decline depend upon vitamin status? MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging.	aging	2011-03-??	OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether gene nutrient interactions influence the risk of cognitive dysfunction among older persons.    DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of 499 adults aged 70-79 years from the Mac Arthur Study of Successful Aging to determine the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in conjunction with plasma levels of homocysteine and of the related B vitamins on multiple domains of cognitive function and cognitive decline.    RESULTS: The APOE-ε4 allele, high homocysteine, low folate, and low vitamin B6 levels were each associated with worse baseline cognitive function, and all but B6 and B12 were associated with seven year cognitive decline. There was no interaction between APOE-ε4, and homocysteine, folate, B6, or B12 in predicting baseline cognitive function (p-values: 0.12-0.94) or longitudinal decline (p-values: 0.52-0.91). Of five cognitive subtests, there was a significant interaction between the ε4 allele, low B6, and decline in correct nam…
8986817	Effect of age on in vivo rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle.	aging	1996-12-24	A progressive decline in muscle performance in the rapidly expanding aging population is causing a dramatic increase in disability and health care costs. A decrease in muscle endurance capacity due to mitochondrial decay likely contributes to this decline in muscle performance. We developed a novel stable isotope technique to measure in vivo rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle using needle biopsy samples and applied this technique to elucidate a potential mechanism for the age-related decline in the mitochondrial content and function of skeletal muscle. The fractional rate of muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis in young humans (24 +/- 1 year) was 0.081 +/- 0.004%.h-1, and this rate declined to 0.047 +/- 0.005%.h-1 by middle age (54 +/- 1 year; P < 0.01). No further decline in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis (0.051 +/- 0.004%.h-1) occurred with advancing age (73 +/- 2 years). The mitochondrial synthesis rate was about 95% higher than that of …
19681754	The NADPH oxidase Nox4 restricts the replicative lifespan of human endothelial cells.	lifespan, aging	2009-10-12	The free radical theory of aging proposes that ROS (reactive oxygen species) are major driving forces of aging, and are also critically involved in cellular senescence. Besides the mitochondrial respiratory chain, alternative sources of ROS have been described that might contribute to cellular senescence. Noxs (NADPH oxidases) are well-known sources of superoxide, which contribute to the antimicrobial capabilities of macrophages, a process involving the prototypical member of the family referred to as Nox2. However, in recent years non-phagocytic homologues of Nox2 have been identified that are involved in processes other than the host defence. Superoxide anions produced by these enzymes are believed to play a major role in signalling by MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and stress-activated kinases, but could also contribute to cellular senescence, which is known to involve oxygen radicals. In HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), Nox4 is predominantly expressed, bu…
8281647	Enhanced left ventricular performance in endurance trained older men.	aging	1994-01-??	BACKGROUND: The age-associated decline in aerobic exercise capacity is partially reversible by endurance exercise training. Moderate-intensity endurance exercise training increases aerobic exercise capacity mediated, in part, by improvement of stroke volume and left ventricular performance in older men. The present study was designed to characterize the nature of cardiovascular adaptations to strenuous endurance exercise of long duration and to delineate the mechanisms underlying increased stroke volume and cardiac output in highly trained older endurance athletes.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine male master athletes (MA: 64 +/- 2 years old, mean +/- SEM) and 9 older sedentary healthy men (controls: 63 +/- 1 year) were studied. Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated with the use of cardiac blood pool imaging and echocardiography. Maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) was 50.4 +/- 1.7 mL.kg-1 x min-1 in the MA and 29.6 +/- 1.4 mL.kg-1 x min-1 (P = .0001) in controls. Systolic and mean blood…
17887813	Nutritional interventions to promote post-exercise muscle protein synthesis.	aging	2007-??-??	Resistance exercise is a powerful stimulus to augment muscle protein anabolism, as it can improve the balance between muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. However, the intake of food during post-exercise recovery is necessary for hypertrophy to occur. Therefore, athletes need to ingest protein following exercise to attain a positive protein balance and maximise their skeletal muscle adaptive response. The interaction between exercise and nutrition is not only important for athletes, but is also of important clinical relevance in the elderly. Exercise interventions combined with specific nutritional modulation provide an effective strategy to counteract or reduce the loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging.
22679310	Effects of estrogen on vascular inflammation: a matter of timing.	aging	2012-08-??	OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to determine the role of time of menopause on vascular inflammation biomarkers and how it affects their modulation by estrogen and raloxifene in postmenopausal women.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Uterine arteries from 68 postmenopausal women were divided into 3 segments and cultured for 24 hours in tissue culture media containing 17β-estradiol (100 nmol/L), raloxifene (100 nmol/L), or vehicle. Assessment of arterial concentration of 13 inflammatory biomarkers was performed by multiplex immunobead-based assay. Aging per se has a positive correlation with the generation of several proinflammatory markers. Although short-term estradiol exposure correlates with lower expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-1β in all age groups, for most biomarkers aging was associated with a switch from a beneficial anti-inflammatory action by estrogen, at earlier stages of menopause, to a proinflammatory profile after 5 years past its…
28575267	Associations Between the Differential Definitions of Elder Mistreatment and Suicidal Ideation Outcomes in U.S. Chinese Older Adults: Do the Definitions Matter?	aging	2017-07-01	Background: Elder mistreatment (EM) prevalence varies greatly according to definitional criteria. However, little is known regarding the significance of different EM definitions with respect to health outcome. This paper explores the association between different definitions of EM and their subtypes and suicidal ideation (SI) in an U.S. Chinese aging population.    Methods: The Population Study of ChINese Elderly in Chicago Study was conducted from 2011 to 2013 of 3157 community-dwelling Chinese older adults aged 60 years. Psychological, physical mistreatment (PM), caregiver neglect (CN), financial exploitation (FE), and overall EM were measured by different definitional approaches varying in the strictness. SI in the past 2 weeks and 12 months were assessed.    Results: After adjusting for confounders, the least restrictive EM definition (odds ratio [OR], 2.10 [1.34-3.28]; OR, 2.43 [1.66-3.55]), moderately restrictive EM definition (OR, 2.87 [1.80-4.56]; OR, 2.71 [1.82-4.04]), and mos…
17502259	Evidence of subcortical and cortical aging of the acoustic pathway: a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study.	aging	2007-06-??	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: During aging, there is evidence of microstructural changes in certain cortical and subcortical brain regions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to study age related microstructural changes in the acoustic pathway.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (mean age 28.5 years) and 15 healthy volunteers (mean age 61.3 years) were examined using a 1.5-T MR system with a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence and an integrated parallel imaging technique DTI Echo-planar-imaging (EPI) sequence. For reliability, 10 subjects underwent a second examination 2 days later. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in six brain regions of the auditory pathway.    RESULTS: We found no left/right asymmetry in the selected brain structures. There were no significant differences (P < .05) in the ADC and FA in the lateral lemniscus and medial geniculate body of young and elderly subjects. However, FA was significantl…
8395564	Opposite age-dependent changes of alpha 2A-adrenoceptors and nonadrenoceptor [3H]idazoxan binding sites (I2-imidazoline sites) in the human brain: strong correlation of I2 with monoamine oxidase-B sites.	aging	1993-09-??	In the postmortem human brain (27 specimens of frontal cortex, Brodmann area 9), the specific binding of the antagonists [3H]RX 821002 (2-methoxyidazoxan) to alpha 2A-adrenoceptors and that of [3H]idazoxan to I2-imidazoline sites (a nonadrenoceptor mitochondrial site) were determined in parallel to study the effect of aging (range, 4-89 years) on both brain proteins. The density of alpha 2A-adrenoceptors and age were negatively correlated (r = -0.71; p < 0.001). In contrast, the density of I2-imidazoline sites was positively correlated with aging (r = 0.59; p < 0.005). The ratio of receptor densities (alpha 2A/I2) also showed a marked negative correlation with age (r = -0.76; p < 0.001). In an age-selected group (range, 10-89 years), the density of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B sites labeled by [3H]Ro 19-6327 (lazabemide) also showed a positive correlation with age (r = 0.80; p < 0.005). In these subjects, the density of I2-imidazoline sites correlated well with the density of MAO-B sites …
25305570	Neural responses to monetary incentives in younger and older adults.	aging	2015-07-01	Reward anticipation is associated with activity in the dopaminergic midbrain as well as the ventral striatum, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. Dopaminergic neuromodulation declines with age, suggesting that incentive processing should also undergo age-related change. However, the literature is mixed, perhaps reflecting variation in the degree to which tasks made demands on learning and memory. Furthermore, the emphasis has been on the reward network, with few studies addressing reward-related activations in other brain regions. In the current study, 16 younger adults (mean age: 25.4) and 15 older adults (mean age: 69.0) underwent fMRI while completing a monetary incentive delay task. This task allowed the separate assessment of responses to gain and loss incentive cues while minimizing memory demands. We assessed incentive-related activations using mean-centered Partial Least Squares, a data-driven multivariate technique optimal for identifying spatiotemporal whole-brain activat…
28012826	Increase of posterior connectivity in aging within the Ventral Attention Network: A functional connectivity analysis using independent component analysis.	aging	2017-??-15	Multiple studies have found neurofunctional changes in normal aging in a context of selective attention. Furthermore, many articles report intrahemispheric alteration in functional networks. However, little is known about age-related changes within the Ventral Attention Network (VAN), which underlies selective attention. The aim of this study is to examine age-related changes within the VAN, focusing on connectivity between its regions. Here we report our findings on the analysis of 27 participants' (13 younger and 14 older healthy adults) BOLD signals as well as their performance on a letter-matching task. We identified the VAN independently for both groups using spatial independent component analysis. Three main findings emerged: First, younger adults were faster and more accurate on the task. Second, older adults had greater connectivity among posterior regions (right temporoparietal junction, right superior parietal lobule, right middle temporal gyrus and left cerebellum crus I) th…
9396718	Effect of aging on the chaperone-like function of human alpha-crystallin assessed by three methods.	aging	1997-12-15	alpha-Crystallin can function as a molecular chaperone by preventing unwanted interactions. This paper presents the effects of aging and cataract on the chaperone-like properties of alpha-crystallin from soluble fractions from the cortex and nucleus of human lenses by using three assays: enzyme inactivation and two turbidity experiments. The three methods complemented each other. There was no decrease with age of chaperone-like function of cortical alpha-low and alpha-high crystallin. Nuclear alpha-low crystallin showed a decrease, whereas alpha-high crystallin showed no age-related change but its protective effect was diminished. Results from the nucleus of 40-year-old cataractous lenses seemed similar to those for clear lenses of equivalent age, whereas 80-year-old cataractous lenses showed decreased chaperone-like behaviour.
21664412	Salivary alpha-amylase response to acute psychosocial stress: the impact of age.	aging	2011-07-??	The impact of stress on health varies across the different stages of human life. Aging is associated with psychobiological changes that could limit our ability to cope with stressors. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie the stress response and the changes that occur in them as we age. Our aim was to investigate age differences in the salivary alpha amylase (sAA) response to stress, and its relationship with other typical stress biomarkers such as cortisol and heart rate (HR). Sixty-two participants divided into two age groups (younger group: N=31, age range: 18-35 years; older group: N=31, age range: 54-71 years) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test and a control condition in a crossover design. No age differences were found in the sAA or HR responses to stress. However, the sAA global output was higher in older than younger adults. Additionally, in the stress condition, the total amount of cortisol released was positively related to t…
21834789	Two age-related accumulation profiles of toxic metals.	aging	2012-07-??	In order to investigate the body burden levels of toxic metals in Japanese, five toxic metal concentrations in scalp hair samples from 28,424 subjects from infant to elderly were determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The geometric mean of hair mercury concentrations showed a high-significant age-correlated increase (r = 0.341, p < 0.0001) with a peak at the 6th decade of life and then decreased with further aging in both sexes. The mean mercury concentrations in male adults were significantly higher than those in female (p < 0.001), indicating the gender difference (male > female) in mercury accumulation. Arsenic also showed a similar accumulation profile with age dependency and gender difference in adult subjects. In contrast, cadmium, lead and aluminium exhibited another type of accumulation profile: the highest burden level was observed in infants aged 0-3 years old for every element in both sexes. In addition, cadmium was found to have a character a…
25488135	A computational analysis on the implications of age-related changes in the expression of cellular signals on the role of IGF-1 in intervertebral disc homeostasis.	aging	2015-01-21	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a well-known anabolic agent in intervertebral discs (IVD), promoting both proteoglycan (PG) biosynthesis and cell proliferation. Accordingly, it is believed that IGF-1 plays a central role in IVD homeostasis. The IGF-mediated anabolic activity in IVD occurs when the growth factor, free from binding proteins (IGFBP), binds to IGF cell surface receptors (IGF-1R). Previous studies reported that, with aging, cellular expression of IGFBP increases, while that of IGF-1R decreases. Both changes in cellular signals are thought to be among the factors that are responsible for the age-related decline in IGF-mediated PG biosynthesis, which ultimately leads to disc degeneration. In this study, a computational model describing the role of IGF-1 in the homeostasis of IVD was deployed in a parametric analysis to investigate the effects of age-related changes in expression of IGF-1R and IGFBP on the IGF-mediated upregulation of PG biosynthesis and cellular proli…
22023564	Neuromodulation of reward-based learning and decision making in human aging.	aging	2011-10-??	In this paper, we review the current literature to highlight relations between age-associated declines in dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation and adult age differences in adaptive goal-directed behavior. Specifically, we focus on evidence suggesting that deficits in neuromodulation contribute to older adults' behavioral disadvantages in learning and decision making. These deficits are particularly pronounced when reward information is uncertain or the task context requires flexible adaptations to changing stimulus-reward contingencies. Moreover, emerging evidence points to age-related differences in the sensitivity to rewarding and aversive outcomes during learning and decision making if the acquisition of behavior critically depends on outcome processing. These age-related asymmetries in outcome valuation may be explained by age differences in the interplay of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation. This hypothesis is based on recent neurocomputational and psychopharm…
8137887	Expression of interleukin-1 alpha and beta in early passage fibroblasts from aging individuals.	aging	????-??-??	Human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) from newborn foreskin constitutively express interleukin-1 (IL-1) mRNA and protein after completing at least 70% (approximately 40 population doublings) of their in vitro life span. This IL-1 in turn induces the synthesis of specific proteins in aging HDFs. To determine whether IL-1 expression may be promoted by in vivo aging, we analyzed the expression of IL-1 and of inducible mRNAs in HDFs from two normal individuals 55 and 92 years old and in HDFs from a patient with premature aging caused by Werner's syndrome. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we detected expression of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and protein in early passage HDFs from both normal individuals and the Werner's syndrome patient. These HDFs also expressed the IL-1-inducible mRNAs for stromelysin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, manganous superoxide dismutase, and collagenase. These results suggest that an age-…
20854835	Age-associated modifications of Base Excision Repair activities in human skin fibroblast extracts.	aging	????-??-??	Base Excision Repair (BER) is the predominant repair pathway responsible for removal of so-called small DNA lesions such as abasic sites (AP site), uracil (U), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG), thymine glycol (Tg). In this study, we investigated effect of aging on excision efficacy of several endogenous base lesions and AP sites using an in vitro multiplexed fluorescent approach on support (parallelized oligonucleotide cleavage assay). Human fibroblasts nuclear extracts from 29 donors of different ages were characterized in their ability to simultaneously excise the different lesions. Clearly, three different groups of lesions emerged according to the efficiency of their cleavage: one exhibited very high cleavage efficiency (AP sites and U paired with G), one showed intermediate cleavage efficiency (U paired with A and Tg). The third group included 8oxoG, A paired with 8oxoG, T at CpG site and hypoxanthine (Hx) and displayed poor repair. Aging was significantly associated with modifica…
27739712	Macroscopic self-oscillations and aging transition in a network of synaptically coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.	aging	2016-09-??	We analyze the dynamics of a large network of coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, which represent the canonical model for class I neurons near the spiking threshold. The network is heterogeneous in that it includes both inherently spiking and excitable neurons. The coupling is global via synapses that take into account the finite width of synaptic pulses. Using a recently developed reduction method based on the Lorentzian ansatz, we derive a closed system of equations for the neuron's firing rate and the mean membrane potential, which are exact in the infinite-size limit. The bifurcation analysis of the reduced equations reveals a rich scenario of asymptotic behavior, the most interesting of which is the macroscopic limit-cycle oscillations. It is shown that the finite width of synaptic pulses is a necessary condition for the existence of such oscillations. The robustness of the oscillations against aging damage, which transforms spiking neurons into nonspiking neurons, is an…
17211576	Basal and infection-induced levels of heat shock proteins in human aging.	aging	2007-06-??	Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are ubiquitously expressed proteins, which are highly inducible by a variety of stressful stimuli. As organisms age, various denatured proteins such as proteins modified by oxidation have been detected. Such abnormal proteins might serve as stress signals for the induction of Hsp, which plays indispensable roles in protecting proteins from denaturation. Although it is well known that the heat shock induced expression of Hsp decreases with age, little attention has been given to the unstimulated, basal levels of Hsp. Therefore, a study was performed to examine the expression pattern of various Hsp with aging, under normal physiological conditions in human peripheral blood cells. The basal levels of Hsp32, Hsp70 and Hsp90 increased significantly with age in controls but not patients. Moreover, the levels of Hsp32, Hsp70, Hsp90, but not Hsp27 correlated positively among each other, indicating both common and different regulatory mechanisms. Higher levels of Hsp32…
18489731	Aging-related differences in basal heat shock protein 70 levels in lymphocytes are linked to altered frequencies of lymphocyte subsets.	aging	2008-08-??	Cell stress responses are ubiquitous in all organisms and are characterized by the induced synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsp). Previous studies as well as recent reports by our group have consistently suggested that aging leads to an increase in the basal levels of Hsp70. Here we extend these studies by examining the differential Hsp70 response of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) subsets. It is well established that with aging, one of the major changes in the T cell pool is an expansion of T cells with the memory phenotype as well as those deficient for the CD28 molecule. To determine if alterations in the frequency of T cell subsets might be responsible for the observations, we have carried out a more comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of the various phenotypes of PBL under unstimulated conditions. Cells were obtained from 10 young and 10 elderly normal subjects. The basal Hsp70 levels in the various PBL phenotypes were comparable between young and elderly subjects. However, …
7213171	Iris angiography and aqueous photofluorometry in normal subjects.	aging	1981-03-??	Iris angiography and photofluorometry of the aqueous were performed on 44 normal subjects equally distributed between 15 and 65 years of age. Hemoglobin AIc determinations were performed in 20 of these persons. Leakage from the pupillary margin was present in 20% of the eyes studied. In all cases of leakage, the dye faded quickly after the initial peak concentration. No leakage was observed from radial iris vessels. Photofluorometric readings of the aqueous 60 minutes after injection increased significantly with age. Hemoglobin AIc measurements were observed to correlate significantly with aqueous fluorescein concentration. Both these observations may reflect an altered permeability of biologic membranes associated with aging.
3510226	Effect of age on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in normal subjects: simultaneous measurement of active and inactive renin, renin substrate, and aldosterone in plasma.	aging	1986-02-??	To investigate the effect of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, plasma renin substrate concentrations (PRSC); plasma total, active, and inactive renin concentrations (TRC, ARC, and IRC); PRA; and plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) were measured simultaneously in 60 normal subjects, 18-84 yr old. PRSC was measured by the addition of excess human renal renin. ARC and TRC after trypsin activation were measured by adding sheep renin substrate; IRC was calculated by subtracting ARC from TRC. The active renin ratio was calculated as follows: ARC/TRC X 100%. PRA and PAC were measured by RIA. There were no significant changes in PRSC, TRC, IRC, and PRA to PAC ratio with aging. Both ARC and active renin ratio fell significantly with aging (r = 0.46 and P less than 0.01; and r = 0.54 and P less than 0.01, respectively). PRA and PAC also tended to decrease with aging (r = 0.35 and P less than 0.01; and r = 0.59 and P less than 0.01, respectively). A significant positive corre…
9820491	Age-associated decline in cdk1 activity delays cell cycle progression of human T lymphocytes.	aging	1998-11-15	Despite the repeatedly observed impaired proliferative response of T lymphocytes from aged donors, the precise molecular basis underlying such a defect is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), a serine-threonine kinase required for entry into mitosis, is implicated in this age-associated dysregulation of the cell cycle. T lymphocytes derived from young and elderly donors were blocked in S phase by hydroxyurea after a 48-h activation by anti-CD3 Abs. Under these experimental conditions, only the cells that were already located beyond the S phase were able to complete the cell cycle, decreasing their DNA content from 4n to 2n chromosomes. Using this procedure, a delay in the accomplishment of mitosis could be observed in cells from elderly individuals, as evidenced by propidium iodide staining. In this age group, only a minimal cdk1 activity could be immunoprecipitated from cells sorted in G2/M after nocodazole block. Th…
26089342	Individual differences in the neural signature of subjective value among older adults.	aging	2016-??-??	Some healthy older adults show departures from standard decision-making patterns exhibited by younger adults. We asked if such departures are uniform or if heterogeneous aging processes can designate which older adults show differing decision patterns. Thirty-three healthy older adults with varying decision-making patterns on a complex decision task (the Iowa Gambling Task) completed an intertemporal choice task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined whether value representation in the canonical valuation network differed across older adults based on complex decision-making ability. Older adults with advantageous decision patterns showed increased activity in the valuation network, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and striatum. In contrast, older adults with disadvantageous decision patterns showed reduced or absent activation in the VMPFC and striatum, and these older adults also showed greater blood oxygen level dependent signal tempor…
9314912	Correlation of reproductive aging with function in selected organ systems.	aging	1997-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To compare day 3 FSH levels with biomarkers of aging in other organ systems in healthy, older, reproductive age women.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional pilot study.    SETTING: Healthy volunteers in an academic, tertiary care center.    PATIENT(S): Healthy, regularly cycling women aged 40 to 45 years divided into two groups: those with normal day 3 FSH levels and those with elevated day 3 FSH levels.    INTERVENTION(S): Blood and urine collection with blood pressure measurement, pulmonary function testing, bone densitometry, and skin biopsy.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Comparison between groups for serum creatinine, albumin, glucose, hematocrit, DHEAS, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels; creatinine clearance (CrCl); forced expiratory volume in 1 second; forced vital capacity; bone density at the wrist, hip, and lumbar spine; and mean dermal thickness.    RESULT(S): Hematocrit and CrCl values were significantly lower in the group with high…
19135052	Protein aging: truncation of aquaporin 0 in human lens regions is a continuous age-dependent process.	lifespan, aging	2009-05-??	The human lens is ideal for the study of macromolecular aging because cells in the centre, along with their constituent proteins, are present for our entire lives. We examined the major membrane protein, aquaporin 0 (AQP0), in regions of the lens formed at different times during our lifespan, to determine if similar changes could be detected and if they were progressive. Membrane fractions from three concentric lens regions were examined by SDS-PAGE coupled with densitometry, and Western blotting, to assess the time course of truncation. The overall extent of modification was also examined by MALDI mass spectrometry of the undigested proteins. In all regions, AQP0 became progressively more truncated, specifically by the loss of a 2kDa intracellular C-terminal peptide. The proteolysis increased steadily in all regions such that half of the AQP0 in the barrier region (that part of the lens formed immediately after birth) had been cleaved by age 40-50. MALDI mass spectrometry revealed tha…
8436624	Decrease in human striatal dopamine D2 receptor density with age: a PET study with [11C]raclopride.	aging	1993-03-??	The effect of age on human striatal dopamine D2 receptors was investigated with positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]raclopride as a radioligand. Twenty-one healthy volunteers aged from 20 to 81 years were studied. An equilibrium method was applied and two separate PET scans with different specific activities of [11C]raclopride were performed. The maximal number of receptors (Bmax) and their dissociation constant (Kd) were calculated using Scatchard analysis. There was an age-dependent decline in the Bmax (r = -0.49; p = 0.02) of striatal D2 receptors while the Kd remained unchanged. The results show that there is an age-related loss of striatal D2 receptors, which, together with other changes in the brain nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, may contribute to extrapyramidal symptoms associated with aging.
15462613	Effects of aging on muscle fibre type and size.	aging	2004-??-??	Aging has been associated with a loss of muscle mass that is referred to as 'sarcopenia'. This decrease in muscle tissue begins around the age of 50 years, but becomes more dramatic beyond the 60th year of life. Loss of muscle mass among the aged directly results in diminished muscle function. Decreased strength and power contribute to the high incidence of accidental falls observed among the elderly and can compromise quality of life. Moreover, sarcopenia has been linked to several chronic afflictions that are common among the aged, including osteoporosis, insulin resistance and arthritis. Loss of muscle fibre number is the principal cause of sarcopenia, although fibre atrophy--particularly among type II fibres--is also involved. Several physiological mechanisms have been implicated in the development of sarcopenia. Denervation results in the loss of motor units and thus, muscle fibres. A decrease in the production of anabolic hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-…
8224043	Does diet provide adequate amounts of calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc in a well-educated adult population?	aging	????-??-??	Standard advice from dietitians, nutritionists, and physicians is that if one eats a well-balanced diet containing a variety of foods, supplements are not necessary. Little information is available, especially in those over 75, to determine whether actual diets do provide adequate amounts of these minerals. The participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging provide seven-day records which include vitamin and mineral supplement intakes. Median daily dietary intakes from diet in all 564 subjects and from diet plus supplements in those who use them were analyzed by age group and gender. More women than men took supplements. Median intakes of calcium from diet were below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for unsupplemented women and for supplemented women over 60. Approximately 25% of women under 50 and 10% of women over 50 consumed less than two thirds of the RDA for iron from diet. For both men and women, all groups had median diet intakes below the RDA for magnesium. Fo…
20815053	Correlation of putative iron content as represented by changes in R2* and phase with age in deep gray matter of healthy adults.	aging	2010-09-??	PURPOSE: To establish a correlation between putative iron content using susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) phase and T2* weighted magnitude values in the basal ganglia and the thalamus as a function of age in healthy human brains.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred healthy adults (range, 20-69 years; mean, 43 years) were evaluated for this study using a gradient echo sequence. The original magnitude and high pass filtered phase data were analyzed as proxy variables for iron content in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and pulvinar thalamus. Each structure was broken into two parts, a high iron content region and a low iron content region.    RESULTS: Both magnitude and phase data showed an increase in putative iron content with age. However, the high iron content region revealed two new pieces of information: both the average iron content per pixel and the area of high iron increased with age. Furthermore, significant increase…
24435852	Macular pigment optical density is related to cognitive function in older people.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: the xanthophylls lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) exist in relatively high concentration in multiple central nervous tissues (e.g. cortex and neural retina). L + Z in macula (i.e. macular pigment, MP) are thought to serve multiple functions, including protection and improvement of visual performance. Also, L + Z in the macula are related to L + Z in the cortex.    OBJECTIVE: to determine whether macular pigment optical density (MPOD, L + Z in the macula) is related to cognitive function in older adults.    METHODS: participants were older adults (n = 108, 77.6 ± 2.7 years) sampled from the age-related maculopathy ancillary study of the Health Aging and Body Composition Study (Memphis, TN, USA). Serum carotenoids were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. MPOD was assessed using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Eight cognitive tests designed to evaluate several cognitive domains including memory and processing speed were administered. Partial correlation coe…
16581050	Chondroitin sulfate in normal human plasma is modified depending on the age. Its evaluation in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.	aging	2006-08-??	Plasma chondroitin sulfate (CS) amount and charge density were determined in 45 healthy volunteers (control group), 45 pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-affected patients and 19 healthy carriers by using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) and HPLC equipped with postcolumn derivatization and fluorescence detection. The mean values of CS amount were 4.9+/-1.21 for volunteers, 4.7+/-1.40 for PXE subjects and 4.4+/-1.44 for the carriers. No significant differences were found for the three human subjects groups. On the contrary, by considering the age of normal volunteers, a significant increase of plasma CS amount was measured. In fact, the volunteers aging from 17 to 40 years (mean 32.1) showed a CS concentration of 4.3+/-1.30 while the group ranging from 50 to 74 years (mean 56.9) had a value of 5.6+/-1.16 with a significant increase of +30.2%. The same significant increase in CS plasma content with increasing age was measured for PXE-affected and healthy carriers grou…
17306488	Structural alterations in outer arms of IgG oligosaccharides in patients with Werner syndrome.	aging	2007-06-??	Werner syndrome (WS) is a heredofamilial disorder characterized by clinicopathological premature aging. In healthy individuals, structural alteration of serum IgG oligosaccharides is known to be an aging phenotype. In the present study, we determined and compared oligosaccharide structures of serum IgG among WS patients, healthy age-sex-matched individuals, and healthy elderly individuals from both sexes in order to reveal whether WS patients exhibit an aging phenotype in terms of IgG oligosaccharide structure. Sialylation and galactosylation levels of IgG oligosaccharides from WS patients were similar to those from healthy elderly individuals in which sialylation and galactosylation levels were significantly lower than those from the healthy age-sex-matched individuals. In contrast, the bisecting N-acetylglucosaminylation level of IgG oligosaccharides from WS patients was comparable to that from the healthy age-sex-matched controls and significantly lower than that of the healthy elde…
19002057	T2* relaxometry in liver, pancreas, and spleen in a healthy cohort of one hundred twenty-nine subjects-correlation with age, gender, and serum ferritin.	aging	2008-12-??	OBJECTIVE: To assess T2* values of liver, pancreas, and spleen in a healthy cohort and to compare the gained values with serum ferritin levels and anthropometric data. In addition, the relationship of T2* between the 3 organs was investigated.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine healthy subjects (85 women, 44 men) were examined on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance whole-body unit. Age ranged from 20 to 70 years (mean age, 47.9 +/- 11.4 years). A multislice fat-saturated breath-hold 2D multiecho gradient-echo sequence was applied for T2* measurement. To assess T2* values of the liver, pancreas, and spleen, T2* maps were calculated. The correlation of organ T2* with serum ferritin and anthropometric data (age, gender, body mass index) was investigated.    RESULTS: Measurement of T2* was feasible in all volunteers. A gender-related analysis revealed significant higher hepatic and splenic T2* values for women than for men (P < 0.01). For the pancreas, these differences could not be …
17318834	Asynchrony of the early maturation of white matter bundles in healthy infants: quantitative landmarks revealed noninvasively by diffusion tensor imaging.	aging	2008-01-??	Normal cognitive development in infants follows a well-known temporal sequence, which is assumed to be correlated with the structural maturation of underlying functional networks. Postmortem studies and, more recently, structural MR imaging studies have described qualitatively the heterogeneous spatiotemporal progression of white matter myelination. However, in vivo quantification of the maturation phases of fiber bundles is still lacking. We used noninvasive diffusion tensor MR imaging and tractography in twenty-three 1-4-month-old healthy infants to quantify the early maturation of the main cerebral fascicles. A specific maturation model, based on the respective roles of different maturational processes on the diffusion phenomena, was designed to highlight asynchronous maturation across bundles by evaluating the time-course of mean diffusivity and anisotropy changes over the considered developmental period. Using an original approach, a progression of maturation in four relative stag…
15823723	The empirical relationship between longevity and physical stature may be obscured by unobserved genetic diversity in the optimal metabolic rate.	longevity	2005-??-??	It is hypothesized that an inheritable "optimal" metabolic rate is associated with the lowest attainable mortality risk, greatest attainable height (in youth) and a desirable body weight. Positive deviations from this rate are reflected in overweight and higher mortality, negative deviations in shorter stature (stunting), low body mass index (BMI), and higher mortality. In a heterogeneous population the optimal rate may differ among genotypes, and those with a higher optimal rate are the ones who can translate more energy intake into growth in height such that under optimal net-nutritional intake, they are able to reach a greater final adult height with a lower body mass index than genotypes with a lower optimal rate. Hence, the optimal height and weight - in terms of longevity - may differ substantially among genotypes, so that an empirical estimation of the relationship may be blurred in a heterogeneous society. Conversely, the "true" association (within genotypes) may be stronger th…
28972819	Schwann Cell Phenotype Changes in Aging Human Dental Pulp.	aging	2018-??-??	Schwann cells are glial cells that support axonal development, maintenance, defense, and regeneration in the peripheral nervous system. There is limited knowledge regarding the organization, plasticity, and aging of Schwann cells within the dental pulp in adult permanent teeth. The present study sought to relate changes in the pattern of Schwann cell phenotypes between young and old adult teeth with neuronal, immune, and vascular components of the dental pulp. Schwann cells are shown to form a prominent glial network at the dentin-pulp interface, consisting of nonmyelinating and myelinating phenotypes, forming a multicellular neuroimmune interface in association with nerve fibers and dendritic cells. Schwann cell phenotypes are recognized by the expression of S100, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), Sox10, GAP43, and p75NTR markers. In young adult teeth, a dense population of nonmyelinating Schwann cells projects processes in close association with sens…
24800631	Aging affects the interaction between attentional control and source memory: an fMRI study.	aging	2014-12-??	Age-related source memory impairments may be due, at least in part, to deficits in executive processes mediated by the PFC at both study and test. Behavioral work suggests that providing environmental support at encoding, such as directing attention toward item-source associations, may improve source memory and reduce age-related deficits in the recruitment of these executive processes. The present fMRI study investigated the effects of directed attention and aging on source memory encoding and retrieval. At study, participants were shown pictures of objects. They were either asked to attend to the objects and their color (source) or to their size. At test, participants determined if objects were seen before, and if so, whether they were the same color as previously. Behavioral results showed that direction of attention improved source memory for both groups; however, age-related deficits persisted. fMRI results revealed that, across groups, direction of attention facilitated medial te…
10997579	Difference in the metabolic response to photic stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex of infants: a fMRI study.	aging	2000-09-??	The metabolic change that occurs during early development of the human brain was studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in which the signal change reflects the balance between the supply and the demand of oxygen during stimulus-related neuronal activation. The subjects were 16 infants, aged < 1 year. They were sedated with pentobarbital, and 8-Hz flickering light was intermittently projected onto their eyelids. Two age groups were analyzed: infants < 60 days old and > 60 days old (corrected for gestational age at birth). The stimulus-related signal change was positive in the lateral geniculate nucleus regardless of the infants' age, but in the primary visual cortex reversed from positive in the younger group to negative in the older group. It is known that synaptogenesis in the lateral geniculate nucleus peaks before birth, and in the primary visual cortex accelerates in the second month after birth. Hence, the inversion of the stimulus-related signal change in the …
9415118	Functional and quantitative measures of receptor-coupled G proteins in human mononuclear leukocytes: no change with age.	aging	????-??-??	Aging has been associated with alterations in signal transduction for a number of neurotransmitter receptors in human tissues. Heterotrimeric G proteins play a pivotal role in postreceptor information transduction, by coupling a variety of hormone and neurotransmitter receptors to several intracellular effector functions. Developmental and age-related changes in the abundance of specific G alpha subunits have been shown in the human brain. In the present study, functional and quantitative measures of G proteins were conducted in human mononuclear leukocytes obtained from 19 healthy subjects of increasing age. Gs protein function, assessed through cholera toxin-sensitive beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic agonists induced increases in 3H-Gpp(NH)p binding capacities to membranes of mononuclear leukocytes, and Gi protein function, assessed through pertussis toxin-sensitive muscarinic agonist induced increase in guanine nucleotide binding capacity, were found to be unaltered by increasing ag…
20007823	High molecular-weight gelatinase species of human Bruch's membrane: compositional analyses and age-related changes.	aging	2010-05-??	PURPOSE: The structural and functional demise of aging Bruch's membrane is associated with a reduction in the activity of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation system. The gelatinase component of the MMP system consists of MMP2 and MMP9 and two high molecular-weight (HMW1, HMW2) species that are yet to be characterized and whose roles in the aging process are yet to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the age-related changes in levels of expression and subunit characterization of the HMW gelatinase species of Bruch's membrane.    METHODS: Gelatin zymography followed by densitometric scanning was used to quantify the level of the HMW species present. Gel-filtration chromatography allowed the fractionation of the gelatinases according to their molecular weight, and subsequent degradation of the HMW species with a mino-phenyl acetate activation, reduction, and alkylation produced subunit fragments for analysis.    RESULTS: Most of the HMW1 and HMW2 pool (80%…
22645023	Oral supplementation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8481 enhances systemic immunity in elderly subjects.	longevity, aging	2013-08-??	Throughout life, there is an aging of the immune system that causes impairment of its defense capability. Prevention or delay of this deterioration is considered crucial to maintain general health and increase longevity. We evaluated whether dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8481 could enhance the immune response in the elderly. This multi-center, double-blind, and placebo controlled study enrolled 61 elderly volunteers who were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or probiotics. Each capsule of probiotics contained at least 3 × 10(7)  L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 8481. Individuals in the study were administered three capsules per day for 6 months. Blood samples were obtained at baseline (time 0), end of month 3, and month 6. We characterized cell subpopulations, measured cytokines by flow cytometry, quantified T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and determined human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) concentrations and …
16310784	Degradation of human aquaporin 0 by m-calpain.	aging	2005-12-19	Opacities (cataracts) in the lens of the eye are a leading cause of preventable blindness. Aquaporins function as water channels, and the C-terminus is postulated as a regulatory domain. The C-terminal domain of aquaporin 0 (AQP0) develops numerous truncation sites during lens aging. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine if the calcium-activated protease m-calpain (EC 3.4.22.17) was responsible for truncation of human AQP0. AQP0 was isolated from young human donors, incubated with recombinant m-calpain, and the cleavage sites on the released peptides were determined by on-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We found that four cleavage sites on human AQP0 could be tentatively assigned to m-calpain. This is the first evidence for possible calpain activity in human lens. Because the cause(s) of 17 other cleavage sites was unknown, the data also suggested that other, as yet unknown, proteases or non-enzymatic mechanisms are more active than calpain in human len…
11428170	Age-related alterations in the signal transduction pathways of the elastin-laminin receptor.	aging	2001-05-??	With aging we assist to alterations in the vascular structure and function. One important factor in these vascular wall changes is the degradation of the elastin fibre major protein: elastin. Elastin peptides derived from the degradation are present in human sera. Elastin peptides induce on fibroblasts, phagocytic cells, lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, a variety of biological effects mediated by the elastin-laminin receptor which has been demonstrated to be present on the membrane of these cells. The transduction pathway of the ELR receptor involves the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) by a pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein. PLC induces the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) leading to the increase of the intracellular free calcium on one hand, and of diacylglycerol (DAG) which stimulates the translocation to the membrane of PKC leading to the phosphorylation of members of the MAPK family, such as p42/p44 MAPK. A progressive age dependent uncoupling…
10911956	Fibroblast responses to exogenous and autocrine growth factors relevant to tissue repair. The effect of aging.	aging	2000-06-??	The aging process is often associated with impaired wound healing, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated are not completely understood. Accordingly, we have investigated the response of human fibroblasts from donors of various ages to platelet-derived and autocrine growth factors, in terms of mitogenicity as well as extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. Our data indicate that fibroblast responses persist during aging, suggesting the involvement of systemic factors in the regulation of the healing process. In this context, we have found that neutral endopeptidase-24.11, a metalloproteinase controlling the action of neuroendocrine peptides and also of immunocyte chemotaxis, is overexpressed during aging. Finally, the connection between these data and those from in vitro aging studies is discussed.
9840819	Serum and urine chromium concentrations in elderly diabetics.	aging	1998-09-??	The serum and urine chromium concentrations of 57 diabetics and 55 normal fasting subjects were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Our results indicate that the chromium concentration ranges of serum and urine for diabetics are 0.22-0.36 and 4.54-5.90 microg/L, respectively, significantly lower than 0.66-0.84 7.80-9.68 microg/L for the normal (P<0.001), which implies that the elderly diabetics probably lack chromium. Further, it was found that the urine chromium level of the female diabetics was substantially higher than that of the male in the same age group (P<0.01), whereas the serum chromium level was almost the same. However, the urine chromium concentration increases with aging, no matter who the diabetics or the controls are. The serum chromium concentrations of the 24 cases patients with 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were significantly lower than that of those with empty stomach, whereas the urine chromium exhibits a contrary tendency. Our data indicat…
9186535	Quantification of loss of haemoglobin components from the circulating red blood cell in vivo.	lifespan	1997-04-??	Previous studies have shown that a considerable amount of haemoglobin is lost from the intact red cell during its lifespan. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contribution of all the haemoglobin components to this process. Therefore, the relative amount of haemoglobins A0, A2, F and the glycated haemoglobins were determined in 24 fractions of different cell age. These fractions were obtained by the combination of counterflow and density centrifugation. When the absolute amount of all haemoglobin components were calculated using the MCH-values of each fraction, it appeared that the mean red cell loss of haemoglobins A0, A2, F, an unknown X and "rest" comprised, respectively, 440, 23, 1, 4 and 1 amol per cell, while the mean gain of the glycated haemoglobins was 84 amol per cell. This resulted in a net loss of 385 amol of haemoglobin per cell. One of the glycated haemoglobins (HbA1e2) turned out to be the product of further carbamylation. It was concluded that in the fir…
22044340	Complaint of insomnia as a predictor of aging symptoms in males at a men's health clinic.	aging	2012-03-??	INTRODUCTION: Issues of men's health have been greatly researched by scholars in recent decades. At men's health clinics, many patients complain of both insomnia and aging males' symptoms (AMS). These symptoms might be influenced by biological, psychological or even social factors. The aim of this study was to investigate different aspects of the relationship between insomnia and aging symptoms.    METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 231 males from a men's health clinic. Participants completed a set of general data and screening assessments, including the AMS rating scale, insomnia severity index (ISI), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck anxiety inventory Chinese version (BAI), to investigate the severity of aging symptoms, insomnia, depression and anxiety.    RESULTS: The ISI correlated significantly with the AMS scale, both with (partial correlation coefficient = 0.470) and without (r = 0.580) controlled variances of depression and anxiety. Using linear regressio…
7556515	Gonadotropin secretion during aging in women: review article.	aging	????-??-??	Biological aging during the postmenopause markedly affects the neuroendocrine control of gonadotropin release. The determination of the age-related dynamics on gonadotropin secretion in postmenopausal women have proven to be a valid approach for delineating changes as a function of progressive age. As a result, major functional derangements, primarily at a hypothalamic rather than a pituitary site, have been determined as concomitants of aging in women. Furthermore, aging may impair the negative feedback sensitivity to ovarian sex steroids, and interfere with the central neurotransmitter activity governing gonadotropin secretion. The data reviewed on gonadotropin secretion in postmenopausal women support the view that the age-related processes are related to a hypothalamic rather than to a pituitary hypofunction.
1249383	Effect of aging on thyroid economy in man.	aging	1976-02-??	The effects of aging on the thyroid are discussed under the headings of metabolic indices, thyroid function, hormone production, blood concentration, and thyroregulatory mechanisms. Possibly elderly men differ from elderly women with regard to thyroid economy, but the available data are too few and contradictory to permit drawing firm inferences about the effects of aging.
18573698	Effects of aging on peripheral chemoreceptor CO2 response during sleep and wakefulness in healthy men.	aging	2008-07-31	Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) prevalence multiplies with age and the mechanisms underlying this disorder are complex. Fifteen young and 13 elderly healthy male volunteers, ages ranging from 25 to 38 and from 55 to 76 years, were studied on three consecutive nights at the sleep laboratory. The peripheral chemoreceptor CO2 response was estimated by the single breath CO2 test (SBCO2T). The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was non-significantly higher in elderly men than in young men. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep SBCO2T was similar in young and elderly subjects. During wakefulness, young had a tendency to higher SBCO2T than elderly (0.25+/-0.08 L/min/mmHg vs. 0.19+/-0.07 L/min/mmHg, respectively; p=0.054), but the five elderly subjects with AHI>5 had significantly higher SBCO2T than the remaining elderly subjects (0.24+/-0.07 L/min/mmHg vs. 0.16+/-0.04 L/min/mmHg, respectively; p=0.024). Aging seems to spare the SBCO2T during sleep. Investigation of SBCO2T during tr…
12557271	In vivo muscarinic 2 receptor imaging in cognitively normal young and older volunteers.	aging	2003-04-??	The precise effects of normal aging on the cholinergic system are unknown, as both in vitro and PET studies have shown conflicting results. In vivo determination of muscarinic receptor distribution and density has been hampered by both poor subtype selectivity and/or blood-brain barrier permeability of known ligands. Previous in vitro and in vivo work with the F-18 labeled muscarinic agonist, 3-(3- (3-[(18)F]Flouropropyl)thio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine ((18)FP-TZTP) suggested the use of (18)FP-TZTP to selectively quantify M2 receptors in humans. In this study, we used (18)FP-TZTP to infer M2 receptor avidity in the brains of 15 healthy younger subjects (mean age = 28.3 +/- 5.5 years) and 20 healthy older subjects (mean age = 62.1 +/- 7.7 years). Corrections for subject motion during the 120-min acquisition and partial voluming (PVC) were performed. A one-tissue compartment model was used to estimate the volumes of distribution (V(T)) of (18)FP-TZTP. Wit…
20501508	Age-dependent differences in the neural mechanisms supporting long-term declarative memories.	aging	2010-08-??	Autobiographical memories enable us to mentally reconstruct and relive past events, which is essential for one's personal identity. Unfortunately, this complex memory system is susceptible to age-related deterioration, possibly changing the way episodic information is being processed in older adults. The aim of this study was to investigate whether age influences the neural activity associated with content (episodic versus semantic) and remoteness (recent versus remote) of memories. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy older and young adults, we found significant age-dependent differences in the neural networks underlying memory content but not remoteness. Our data suggest an age-associated functional reorganization in the neural networks underlying long-term declarative memory. Relative increase in activity of posterior brain regions could reflect changes in visuospatial processing during episodic memory retrieval in older adults.
17094119	Reducing vascular variability of fMRI data across aging populations using a breathholding task.	aging	2007-09-??	The magnitude and shape of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in functional MRI (fMRI) studies vary across brain regions, subjects, and populations. This variability may be secondary to neural activity or vasculature differences, thus complicating interpretations of BOLD signal changes in fMRI experiments. We compare the BOLD responses to neural activity and a vascular challenge and test a method to dissociate these influences in 26 younger subjects (ages 18-36) and 24 older subjects (ages 51-78). Each subject performed a visuomotor saccade task (a vascular response to neural activity) and a breathholding task (vascular dilation induced by hypercapnia) during separate runs in the same scanning session. For the saccade task, signal magnitude showed a significant decrease with aging in FEF, SEF, and V1, and a delayed time-to-peak with aging in V1. The signal magnitudes from the saccade and hypercapnia tasks showed significant linear regressions within subjects and across indiv…
26993959	Reduced Modulation of Pain in Older Adults After Isometric and Aerobic Exercise.	aging	2016-??-??	UNLABELLED: Laboratory-based studies show that acute aerobic and isometric exercise reduces sensitivity to painful stimuli in young healthy individuals, indicative of a hypoalgesic response. However, little is known regarding the effect of aging on exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH). The purpose of this study was to examine age differences in EIH after submaximal isometric exercise and moderate and vigorous aerobic exercise. Healthy older and younger adults completed 1 training session and 4 testing sessions consisting of a submaximal isometric handgrip exercise, vigorous or moderate intensity stationary cycling, or quiet rest (control). The following measures were taken before and after exercise/quiet rest: 1) pressure pain thresholds, 2) suprathreshold pressure pain ratings, 3) pain ratings during 30 seconds of prolonged noxious heat stimulation, and 4) temporal summation of heat pain. The results revealed age differences in EIH after isometric and aerobic exercise, with younger adul…
8352231	Decreased erythropoietin responsiveness to iron deficiency anemia in the elderly.	aging	1993-07-??	The prevalence of anemia in the elderly raises the question of an inappropriate secretion of erythropoietin in response to increased demands. Therefore, the serum erythropoietin concentration of elderly patients (74-95 years) with iron deficiency anemia was measured and compared to that of iron deficiency anemic adults (25-60 years). A lowered erythropoietin secretion in response to anemia was observed in elderly patients in comparison with adults. However, the serum erythropoietin of the anemic elderly was inversely correlated with hemoglobin levels as shown for the anemic adults. The progressive reduction of the renal function observed with aging could explain the decreased capacity of erythropoietin secretion in elderly patients.
12771571	Relation between regional functional MRI activation and vascular reactivity to carbon dioxide during normal aging.	aging	2003-05-??	Recent blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown a reduction of cerebral activation during aging, which may be associated with age-related changes of the cerebral vascular system. The authors used a global hypercapnic breath-holding challenge to define nonneuronal contributions to a significantly reduced activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex during finger tapping in a group of old (n = 6; mean age 65 years) compared with a group of young (n = 6; mean age 27 years) subjects. Within significantly activated voxels in both groups during finger tapping, the mean BOLD signal amplitudes were significantly smaller in the group of older subjects for both tasks. In those voxels showing significant activation only in young subjects during finger tapping, the response to hypercapnia was also greatly diminished in older subjects. The attenuated hypercapnic BOLD signal response in older subjects within this region suggests that age-depe…
23518010	Relationships between brain metabolism decrease in normal aging and changes in structural and functional connectivity.	aging	2013-08-01	Normal aging is characterized by brain glucose metabolism decline predominantly in the prefrontal cortex. The goal of the present study was to assess whether this change was associated with age-related alteration of white matter (WM) structural integrity and/or functional connectivity. FDG-PET data from 40 young and 57 elderly healthy participants from two research centers (n=49/48 in Center 1/2) were analyzed. WM volume from T1-weighted MRI (Center 1), fractional anisotropy from diffusion-tensor imaging (Center 2), and resting-state fMRI data (Center 1) were also obtained. Group comparisons were performed within each imaging modality. Then, positive correlations were assessed, within the elderly, between metabolism in the most affected region and the other neuroimaging modalities. Metabolism decline in the elderly predominated in the left inferior frontal junction (LIFJ). LIFJ hypometabolism was significantly associated with macrostructural and microstructural WM disturbances in long …
29524289	Age-related changes in the ease of dynamical transitions in human brain activity.	aging	2018-??-??	Executive functions, a set of cognitive processes that enable flexible behavioral control, are known to decay with aging. Because such complex mental functions are considered to rely on the dynamic coordination of functionally different neural systems, the age-related decline in executive functions should be underpinned by alteration of large-scale neural dynamics. However, the effects of age on brain dynamics have not been firmly formulated. Here, we investigate such age-related changes in brain dynamics by applying "energy landscape analysis" to publicly available functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy younger and older human adults. We quantified the ease of dynamical transitions between different major patterns of brain activity, and estimated it for the default mode network (DMN) and the cingulo-opercular network (CON) separately. We found that the two age groups shared qualitatively the same trajectories of brain dynamics in both the DMN and CON. However, in both…
18034746	Effect of winemaking practices on color indexes and selected bioactive phenolics of Aglianico wine.	aging	2007-11-??	Phenolic compounds are responsible for the sensory properties of wine as well as the properties beneficial to human health. The objective of this study was to establish the effect of the use of SO2 and pectolitic enzymes in the prefermentative phase, maceration time, and oak aging on color, anthocyanins, tannins, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, rutin, trans-resveratrol, and quercetin content of Aglianico wine. Color indexes and phenolics were analyzed by HPLC and spectrophotometric methods. The addition of SO2 and pectolitic enzymes before fermentation caused an increase in color intensity, color stability, total phenolics, anthocyanins, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin rutin, trans-resveratrol, and quercetin content in Aglianico wine. Longer maceration times gave wines richer in total phenolics and with better chromatic characteristics. Storage in oak caused a decrease in anthocyanins, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, trans-resveratrol, and quercetin content but an increase in total phenoli…
23717434	Association between dopamine D4 receptor polymorphism and age related changes in brain glucose metabolism.	longevity, aging	2013-??-??	Aging is associated with reductions in brain glucose metabolism in some cortical and subcortical regions, but the rate of decrease varies significantly between individuals, likely reflecting genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Here we test the hypothesis that the variant of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene (VNTR in exon 3), which has been associated with novelty seeking and sensitivity to environmental stimuli (negative and positive) including the beneficial effects of physical activity on longevity, influence the effects of aging on the human brain. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and [(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)FDG) to measure brain glucose metabolism (marker of brain function) under baseline conditions (no stimulation) in 82 healthy individuals (age range 22-55 years). We determined their DRD4 genotype and found an interaction with age: individuals who did not carry the 7-repeat allele (7R-, n = 53) had a significant (p<0.0001) negative associat…
17716696	Effects of aging on true and false memory formation: an fMRI study.	aging	2007-11-05	Compared to young, older adults are more likely to forget events that occurred in the past as well as remember events that never happened. Previous studies examining false memories and aging have shown that these memories are more likely to occur when new items share perceptual or semantic similarities with those presented during encoding. It is theorized that decreased item-specific encoding and increased gist encoding contribute to these age differences in memory performance. The current study used a modified version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm to investigate the neural correlates of true and false memory encoding. Results indicated that, compared to young, older adults showed reduced activity in medial temporal lobes (MTL), left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and visual cortices associated with subsequent true memories. Despite these decreases older adults showed increased activity in right VLPFC and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) for subsequent true…
28637772	Tolerance to increased supplemented dietary intakes of methionine in healthy older adults.	aging	2017-08-??	l-Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid for humans and is important for protein synthesis and the formation of polyamines and is involved in the synthesis of many metabolites, including homocysteine. Free-Met supplements have been claimed to have multiple positive effects; however, it remains unclear what the exact tolerance level is. With aging, Met metabolism changes, and increased plasma homocysteine is more apparent. High plasma concentrations of homocysteine are assumed to be associated with a high risk of developing atherosclerosis. We estimated the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of supplemented, oral, free Met in healthy older adults by examining the increase in plasma homocysteine as the primary determinant. We provided capsules with free Met to 15 healthy older adult subjects for 4 wk at climbing dosages of, on average, 9.2, 22.5, 46.3 and 91 mg · kg body weight · d with washout periods of 2 wk between each i…
21285855	Emotional memory deficit and its psychophysiological correlate in family caregivers of patients with dementia.	aging	????-??-??	This study examined the cortisol secretion pattern and declarative memory performance of dementia caregivers. An illustrated story paradigm memory task was used to evaluate the effects of emotional arousal on memory and assess the caregivers' cognitive compensation capacity. Younger (n=19) and elderly (n=24) noncaregivers and elderly caregivers (n=14) took part in 2 experiments to elucidate the effects of aging (experiment 1) and chronic stress (experiment 2) on memory performance and cortisol levels. Each group was divided in 2 subgroups: one that was exposed to an emotionally neutral story, and one that was exposed to a similar, but emotionally arousing story. Participants completed a multiple-choice questionnaire in the test session. Salivary cortisol samples were collected at 8:00 AM, 4:00 PM, and 10:00 PM, 1 day after memory testing. Experiment 1 showed that, despite an age-related memory deficit, arousal manipulation produced a similar effect in both age groups. Experiment 2 show…
25817264	Evaluation of dermal extracellular matrix and epidermal-dermal junction modifications using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging, in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy, echography, and histology: effect of age and peptide applications.	aging	2015-06-??	This study was conducted to establish a new methodology for evaluating elements of dermal extracellular matrix (ECM), of epidermal-dermal junction (EDJ), and effects of molecules which can modulate their synthesis. This methodology is based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI). In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (in vivo RCM) and echography were also used. Using immunohistochemistry methods on explants, age-related modification data were obtained for selected dermal ECM and EDJ proteins (collagen I, collagen IV, collagen VII, collagen XVII, nidogen I, decorin/decorunt) and used as reference for MALDI-MSI studies. A methodology was developed with MALDI-MSI to map epidermis and dermis proteins. Then MALDI-MSI was used to study age modifications. In vivo RCM and high-frequency ultrasounds were used to evaluate ECM and EDJ undulation modifications caused by aging. Anti-aging molecule evaluations were performed with a blend of palmitoyl …
10566961	Quantification of acetylcholinesterase-positive structures in human thymus during development and aging.	aging	2000-01-??	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) localization in the human thymus has been studied by biochemical and morphological methods during development and aging. The occurrence, the amount and the distribution of acetylcholinesterase and the changes with age were examined in 24 human thymuses. The whole human thymus was removed during autopsies in males of the following age-groups: prenatal of six months, new-born, infant, young, adult and elderly. The thymuses were weighed, measured and dissected: the microanatomical details were stained with Eosin-orange, nervous structures were identified by means of Bodian's method. Protein content was determined with biochemical methods. Histoenzymatical and biochemical demonstration of acetylcholinesterase was performed. The morphological results obtained were submitted to quantitative image analysis. Our results show that the thymic microenvironment changes with age; moreover, an increase of acetylcholinesterase-positive structures can be observed with age. …
25149192	Age differences in the neural correlates of novelty processing: The effects of item-relatedness.	aging	2015-07-01	Past research finds that age-related increases in false recognitions are a key contributor to age-related memory decline, suggesting that older adults have difficulty in correctly distinguishing between new and old information, particularly when new items at retrieval are semantically or perceptually related to items from encoding. However, little work has examined the neural mechanisms older adults engage to avoid false recognitions and successfully identify information as novel. In the present study, young and older adults were scanned during a retrieval task in which new items were exemplars from studied categories (related lures) or unstudied categories (unrelated lures) in order to detect age-related differences in the neural correlates of related and unrelated novelty processing. Results showed that, unlike young adults, older adults did not differentially recruit regions such as the anterior cingulate and bilateral middle/inferior temporal gyrus to capitalize on the salient cate…
16042357	Hormonal cut-offs of partial androgen deficiency: a survey of androgen assays.	aging	2005-??-??	While the typical symptomatology of severe hypogonadism in young adults permits the clinical diagnosis of hypoandrogenism, the diagnosis of partial androgen deficiency of the aging male (PADAM), as occurs relatively frequently in elderly males, is much more difficult. This is due to its clinical picture being subtle and aspecific, and to the fact that both clinical and biochemical evidence of androgen deficiency are required for the diagnosis. In the absence of a practical, clinical useful parameter of androgen activity, we have to rely upon bio-active plasma testosterone levels. Although the requirements of androgens in elderly males may be different from those in young, healthy adults, the lower limit of levels observed in the latter is generally used to define biochemical hypoandrogenism. Based on these data, we consider 11 nmol/l of testosterone, 0.225 nmol/l of free testosterone (FT) and 5.3 nmol/l of biotestosterone (bio-T) as the lower normal limits. As even when using the same …
4003875	Determination of mineral-organic bonding effectiveness in bone--theoretical considerations.	aging	1985-??-??	It is postulated that the effectiveness of bonding between the mineral and organic phases could be an important influence on the behavior of bone with respect to its mechanical properties, metabolic activity, and aging effects associated with these factors. Changes in bonding effectiveness might also be related to the etiology of osteoporosis. If this hypothesis is correct, it would be of interest to determine the amount of debonding present in bone. An analysis that employs both macromechanical and micromechanical composite theory is performed to show how this quantity could be calculated. The approach taken is first to determine the elastic moduli of a characteristic volume from bulk elastic properties of bone and the mineral crystallite orientation distribution. Voigt and Reuss type averages are used to obtain upper and lower bounds. Modifications of the Halpin-Tsai equations that apply to chopped fiber composites are then used to calculate the amount of debonding between the phases…
1336381	Phosphoinositide fatty acid composition of peripheral blood lymphocytes from aging humans.	aging	1992-11-??	The interaction of the T-cell receptor complex with the ligands is associated with early molecular events involved in the process of signal transduction implicating phosphoinositide breakdown. In elderly people, abnormalities in membrane signal transduction pathways are the basis of the immune deficiency associated with aging. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from aging humans and young subjects were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and the phosphoinositide fractions were analyzed in order to determine the fatty acid composition in resting and stimulated conditions. In aging humans, in resting conditions, the all three phosphoinositide fractions appeared more saturated than the corresponding fractions in young subjects. Following anti-CD3 stimulation a decrease in arachidonic acid relative molar content was detected in both young and old subjects, but the arachidonic acid content in resting conditions greatly differed between the two groups, suggesting a different modulation of…
20157861	Age-associated striatal dopaminergic denervation and falls in community-dwelling subjects.	aging	2009-??-??	Older adults have a high prevalence of gait and balance disturbances and falls. Normal aging is associated with significant striatal dopaminergic denervation, which might be a previously unrecognized additional contributor to geriatric falls. This study investigated the relationship between the severity of age-associated striatal dopaminergic denervation (AASDD) and falls in community-dwelling subjects. Community-dwelling subjects who did not have a clinical diagnosis to explain falls (n = 77: 43 female, 34 male; mean age 61.4 +/- 16.4; range 20-85) completed clinical assessment and brain dopamine transporter (DAT) [(11)C]beta-CFT (2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane) positron emission tomography imaging followed by 6 months of prospective fall monitoring using diaries. Results showed a significant inverse relationship between striatal DAT activity and age (r = -0.82, p < 0.001). A total of 26 subjects (33.8%) reported at least one fall, with 5 subjects (6.5%) reporting …
20542991	A comprehensive study of whole-brain functional connectivity in children and young adults.	aging	2011-02-??	Over the past decade, examination of functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging has become an important tool to investigate functional changes in patient populations, healthy aging, and recently also child development. Most prior developmental studies focused on functional connectivity between brain regions important for cognitive or emotional control and the so-called "default-mode network." In the present study, we investigated whole-brain functional connectivity in children (11-13 years; N = 19) and young adults (19-25 years; N = 29), without a priori restrictions to specific regions. We found similar patterns of functionally connected regions in children and young adults, but there were differences in the size of functionally connected regions (i.e., the number of voxels), as well as in the strength of functional connectivity (i.e., the correlation value) between brain regions. This indicates that functional connectivity continues to change during adolescen…
16840576	Resistance training increases basal limb blood flow and vascular conductance in aging humans.	aging	2006-11-??	Age-related reductions in basal limb blood flow and vascular conductance are associated with the metabolic syndrome, functional impairments, and osteoporosis. We tested the hypothesis that a strength training program would increase basal femoral blood flow in aging adults. Twenty-six sedentary but healthy middle-aged and older subjects were randomly assigned to either a whole body strength training intervention group (52 +/- 2 yr, 3 men, 10 women) who underwent three supervised resistance training sessions per week for 13 wk or a control group (53 +/- 2 yr, 4 men, 9 women) who participated in a supervised stretching program. At baseline, there were no significant differences in blood pressure, cardiac output, basal femoral blood flow (via Doppler ultrasound), vascular conductance, and vascular resistance between the two groups. The strength training group increased maximal strength in all the major muscle groups tested (P < 0.05). Whole body lean body mass increased (P < 0.05) with str…
16368747	Hormonal and biochemical determinants of trabecular microstructure at the ultradistal radius in women and men.	aging	2006-03-??	CONTEXT: Using high-resolution three-dimensional peripheral quantitative computed tomography (3D-pQCT) imaging, we recently described sex and age effects on bone microstructure at the ultradistal radius in men and women. Although bone volume/tissue volume decreased with age in both sexes, changes in trabecular number (TbN) and thickness (TbTh) in men were complex, with evidence for conversion of thick trabeculae into more numerous, thinner trabeculae in young men.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to define the relationship between hormonal and bone turnover variables and trabecular microstructure at the ultradistal radius.    DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study in the general community that included 205 women and 269 men, aged 21-97 yr.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured correlation of bone volume/tissue volume, TbN, TbTh, and trabecular separation with hormonal and bone turnover variables.    RESULTS: In young men (20-39 yr), TbT…
27086196	Per meal dose and frequency of protein consumption is associated with lean mass and muscle performance.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that for older adults evenly distributing consumption of protein at 30-40 g per meal throughout the day may result in more favorable retention of lean mass and muscular strength. Such a thesis has not, to our knowledge, been tested outside of short-term studies or acute measures of muscle protein synthesis.    AIMS: To examine whether the number of times an individual consumed a minimum of 30 g of protein at a meal is associated with leg lean mass and knee extensor strength.    METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used, with 1081 adults (50-85 y) constituting the analytic sample. A "multiple pass" 24-h dietary interview format was used to collect detailed information about the participants' dietary intake. Knee extensor strength was assessed objectively using the Kin Com MP dynamometer. Leg lean mass was estimated from whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.    RESULTS: Participants with 1 vs. 0 (β = 23.6, p = 0.002) and 2 v…
17123154	Sociodemographic effects on the dynamics of task-specific ADL functioning at the oldest-old ages: the case of China.	longevity	2007-03-??	Studies that systematically examine the dynamics of task-specific ADL functioning and its associates are very rare. Using the first three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, this study examines the dynamics of each of the six ADL tasks (bathing, dressing, toileting, indoor transferring, eating, and continence) and their sociodemographic correlates among the oldest-old by including the ADL information both at the follow-up wave for survivors and at the time prior to death for those who died during survey intervals. Effects of age, gender, urban/rural residence, ethnicity, education, primary lifetime occupation, primary source of daily expenses, living alone, and marital status are examined in both the absence and presence of other various confounders. Our results show that each sociodemographic factor still plays some limited role in the dynamics of ADL functioning across tasks.
1418830	Effects of aging and hypertension on plasma angiotensin II and platelet angiotensin II receptor density.	aging	1992-10-??	Plasma renin activity (PRA) declines with age in normal individuals, but the effect of age on plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) is less clear. A decline in plasma ANG II with age could result in altered platelet ANG II receptor density since plasma hormone levels influence their target organ receptors. To investigate this possibility, PRA, plasma ANG II, and platelet ANG II receptor density were examined in 17 young, 12 middle-aged, and 14 elderly healthy normotensive volunteers. To assess whether hypertension altered receptor density, these variables were also examined in 23 hypertensive patients. In normotensives, there was a negative correlation between age and PRA (r = -0.43, P < .05), no significant change in basal plasma ANG II with age, and a weak positive correlation between age and ANG II receptor density (r = 0.34, P < .05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the relationship between age and ANG II receptor density was independent of the associated rise in mean arterial …
24323631	Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors and heart failure risk in older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study.	aging	2014-01-??	BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels are associated with risk for heart failure (HF). The soluble TNF type 1 (sTNF-R1) and type 2 (sTNF-R2) receptors are elevated in patients with manifest HF, but whether they are associated with risk for incident HF is unclear.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Cox proportional hazard models, we examined the association between baseline levels of sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 with incident HF risk among 1285 participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (age, 74.0±2.9 years; 51.4% women; 41.1% black). At baseline, median (interquartile range) of TNF, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 levels was 3.14 (2.42-4.06), 1.46 (1.25-1.76), and 3.43 (2.95-4.02) ng/mL, respectively. During a median follow-up of 11.4 (6.9-11.7) years, 233 (18.1%) participants developed HF. In models controlling for other HF risk factors, TNF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.61 per log2 increase) and sTNF-R1 (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15-2.46 per log2 increas…
16713371	BDNF and trkB mRNA expression in the hippocampus and temporal cortex during the human lifespan.	aging	2006-10-??	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase B (trkB) influence neuronal survival, differentiation, synaptogenesis, and maintenance. Using in situ hybridization we examined the spatial and temporal expression of mRNAs encoding these proteins during diverse stages of life in the human hippocampus and inferior temporal cortex. We examined six postnatal time points: neonatal (1-3 months), infant (4-12 months), adolescent (14-18 years), young adult (20-24 years), adult (34-43 years), and aged (68-86 years). Within the hippocampus, levels of BDNF mRNA did not change significantly with age. However, levels of both the full-length form of trkB (trkB TK+) mRNA and the truncated form of trkB (trkB TK-) decreased over the life span (p < 0.05). In the temporal cortex, BDNF and trkB TK+ mRNA levels were highest in neonates and decreased with age (r = -0.4 and r = -0.7, respectively, both p < 0.05). In contrast, TrkB TK- mRNA levels remained constant across the life spa…
28583387	Prefrontally-mediated alterations in the retrieval of negative events: Links to memory vividness across the adult lifespan.	aging	2017-07-28	Prior research has identified age-by-valence interactions in both behavior and neural recruitment; age has been associated with increased retrieval of positive relative to negative information as well as an increased tendency to recruit prefrontal regions during negative event retrieval and for this recruitment to correspond to decreased hippocampal connectivity. To date, the explicit relation between prefrontal recruitment and memory phenomenology has not been examined. The current study examined the link between these two measures by examining age-by-valence interactions in the relation between prefrontal recruitment and subjective ratings of memory vividness. Participants (ages 18-85) encoded visual images paired with verbal titles. During a scanned retrieval session, they were presented with titles and asked whether each had been seen with an image during encoding. Participants provided vividness ratings following retrieval of each image. Age was associated with greater prefrontall…
20092696	Satellite cell characterization from aging human muscle.	aging	2010-02-??	OBJECTIVES: Satellite cells (SCs) are skeletal muscle progenitor cells located between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. They are responsible for muscle growth and repair. In humans, aging results in the depletion of the SC population and in its proliferative activity, but not in its function. It has not yet been determined whether under conditions of massive muscle fiber death in vivo, the regenerative potential of SCs is totally or partially compromised in old muscle. No studies have yet tested whether advanced age is a factor that restrains the response of SCs to muscle denervation in humans; this is also due to difficulties in the isolation and in the culture of SCs from a small human surgery fragment. The aim of this study was to study in depth muscle regeneration analysing the SC ability of SCs to proliferate and differentiate in aging human patients.    METHODS: In order to study in more detail the molecular mechanism, the proliferative and differentiative ab…
15939070	Common promoter polymorphisms of inflammation and thrombosis genes and longevity in older adults: the cardiovascular health study.	longevity, aging	2005-07-??	Inflammatory response genes may influence life span or quality at advanced ages. Using data from the population-based cardiovascular health study (CHS) cohort, we examined the associations between promoter polymorphisms of several inflammation and thrombosis genes with longevity. We ascertained genotypes for interleukin (IL)-6 -174 G/C, beta-fibrinogen -455 G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 -675 4G/5G, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) -438 G/A in 2224 men and women > or = 65 years old at baseline. During 10 years of follow-up, men with the TAFI -438 A/A genotype had decreased mortality due to all causes, and lived, on average, 0.9 more years of life, or 1.1 more years of healthy life, than men with the -438 G allele. The effects of TAFI -438 G/A in women were smaller and not statistically significant. PAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women. In expl…
1601395	Episodic thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion during aging in postmenopausal women.	aging	1992-04-??	While aging is known to decrease episodic thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in men, no detailed information is available as to age-related alterations in the TSH and prolactin (PRL) release patterns in postmenopausal women (PMW). Accordingly, we compared the TSH and prolactin (PRL) secretory profiles of 6 euthyroid younger PMW (mean age: 53.0 years) with those of 7 euthyroid older PMW (mean age: 80.4 years). In all PMW, blood samples were obtained at 10 minute intervals for 10 hours for serial determinations of TSH and PRL by RIA. While thyroxine (T4) serum concentrations were not different in younger from older PMW, triiodothyronine (T3) levels markedly (p less than 0.05) decreased in older PMW. In both younger and older PMW, TSH and PRL were secreted episodically (by Cluster pulse algorithm), with considerable inter-individual variabilities in either study group. TSH and PRL pulse attributes (interpulse intervals, frequencies, amplitudes) were comparable in younger and older PMW, although …
10503722	Dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate production in the human adrenal during development and aging.	aging	1999-09-??	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is produced in prodigious quantities by the human adrenal, principally as the 3-sulfoconjugate DHEA sulfate (DS) during intrauterine life. The fetal zone and neocortex cells of the fetal adrenal express large amounts of DHEA sulfotransferase and minimal amounts, at least until very near the end of gestation, of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. This pattern of enzyme expression favors substantial secretion of DHEA/DS with minimal cortisol produced; the DHEA/DS serves as the major precursor for placental estrogen formation in human pregnancy. Aside from adrenocorticotropin, other physiologic regulators of growth and steroidogenesis in the fetal adrenal have been postulated to exist, but have yet to be identified. Whereas intrauterine stressors may activate adrenal cortisol secretion, the fetal adrenal responds to many pregnancy conditions by suppressing DHEA/DS formation. After birth, the human adrenal undergoes reorganization whereby the large, inner fet…
19465126	Free testosterone and free dihydrotestosterone throughout the life span of men.	aging	2009-08-??	OBJECTIVE: The dihydrotestosterone/testosterone ratio seems to be an important factor in the expression of androgenic activity, especially in the prostate and pilosebaceous unit. Whereas the decline of testosterone in aging men is well known, controversial data can be found concerning the age dependence of dihydrotestosterone levels. Hormonal values from our database served for the construction of the life span curve of free dihydrotestosterone/free testosterone ratio.    METHODS: The results of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and SHBG determination obtained by immunoassays from 13,152 male patients were used for the calculation of free steroid content and the construction of the age dependence curves.    RESULTS: After initial high free dihydrotestosterone: free testosterone ratio in infancy it decreases at the start of puberty and remains practically without change from approx. 20 years of age till senescence.    CONCLUSION: The course of free dihydrotestosterone/free testosterone …
20858747	Subcellular localization-dependent decrements in skeletal muscle glycogen and mitochondria content following short-term disuse in young and old men.	aging	2010-12-??	Previous studies have shown that skeletal muscle glycogen and mitochondria are distributed in distinct subcellular localizations, but the role and regulation of these subcellular localizations are unclear. In the present study, we used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effect of disuse and aging on human skeletal muscle glycogen and mitochondria content in subsarcolemmal (SS), intermyofibrillar (IMF), and intramyofibrillar (intra) localizations. Five young (∼23 yr) and five old (∼66 yr) recreationally active men had their quadriceps muscle immobilized for 2 wk by whole leg casting. Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis before and after the immobilization period. Immobilization induced a decrement of intra glycogen content by 54% (P < 0.001) in both age groups and in two ultrastructurally distinct fiber types, whereas the content of IMF and SS glycogen remained unchanged. A localization-dependent decrease (P = 0.03) in mitochondria content following immobiliz…
24981111	Impact of the AGTR1 A1166C polymorphism on subcortical hyperintensities and cognition in healthy older adults.	aging	2014-??-??	Vascular aging consists of complex and multifaceted processes that may be influenced by genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system. A polymorphism in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AGTR1/rs5186) has been associated with an increased risk for arterial stiffness, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. Despite these identified relationships, the impact of AGTR1 A1166C on white matter integrity and cognition is less clear in a healthy aging population. The present study utilized indices of neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment to examine the impact of the A1166C polymorphism on subcortical hyperintensities (SH) and cognition in 49 healthy adults between ages 51-85. Using a dominant statistical model (CC + CA (risk) vs. AA), results revealed significantly larger SH volume for individuals with the C1166 variant (p < 0.05, partial eta(2) = 0.117) compared with those with the AA genotype. Post hoc analyses indicated that increased SH volume in C allele carriers could …
486515	Effect of in vitro aging on 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha-producing activity in cultured human diploid lung fibroblasts.	aging	1979-08-30	Prostaglandin synthesis in human diploid fibroblasts was studied by incubating [14C]-arachidonic acid with cell homogenates. The majority of prostaglandins produced in young cells was 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. The 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha-producing activity of cultures declined with in vitro aging, and was almost undetectable at the senescent stage, while total production of thromboxane B2, prostaglandin F2 alpha and prostaglandin E2-like metabolites increased with in vitro aging.
9626564	Blue light-induced singlet oxygen generation by retinal lipofuscin in non-polar media.	aging	1998-05-??	Accumulation of lipofuscin (LF) is a prominent feature of aging in the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. This age pigment exhibits substantial photoreactivity, which may increase the risk of retinal photodamage and contribute to age-related maculopathy. In a previous study, we detected singlet oxygen generation by lipofuscin granules excited with blue light. In this paper we investigated the ability of hydrophobic components of lipofuscin to photogenerate singlet oxygen in non-polar environments. Singlet oxygen was detected directly by monitoring its characteristic phosphorescence at ca 1270 nm. The action spectrum of singlet oxygen formation indicated that this process was strongly wavelength-dependent and its efficiency decreased with increasing wavelength by a factor of ten, comparing 420 nm and 520 nm. The quantum yield of singlet oxygen increased with increasing concentration of oxygen. Using laser flash photolysis we studied the possible mechanism of singlet oxygen fo…
9509398	Trisomy 21 and accelerated aging: DNA-repair parameters in peripheral lymphocytes of Down's syndrome patients.	aging	1998-01-12	Down's syndrome (DS) cases from 1-40 years of age and showing no other anomalies or deficiencies were categorized into three age groups: group 1, < or = 12 years; group 2, 13-25 years; and group 3, > or = 26 years. The DNA-repair markers like unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS), activities of DNA polymerases, (Total, beta and epsilon) and two endodeoxyribonucleases, (UV- and AP-DNases) were assessed in the peripheral lymphocytes of these subjects (under different conditions) along with age and sex matched normal healthy human subjects. The DS group showed lower DNA-repair efficiency and also an accelerated decline in DNA-repair capacity with age. These results indicate that deteriorated DNA-repair potential could be one of the probable reasons for premature aging seen in this chromosomal disorder.
17409149	The cytomegalovirus-specific CD4+ T-cell response expands with age and markedly alters the CD4+ T-cell repertoire.	aging	2007-07-??	Immune function in the elderly is associated with a number of phenotypic and functional abnormalities, and this phenomenon of immune senescence is associated with increased susceptibility to infection. The immune response to pathogens frequently declines with age, but the CD8(+) T-cell response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) is unusual, as it demonstrates a significant expansion over time. Here we have documented the CD4(+) T-cell immune response to CMV in healthy donors of different ages. The magnitude of the CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell immune response increases from a mean of 2.2% of the CD4(+) T-cell pool in donors below 50 years of age to 4.7% in donors aged over 65 years. In addition, CMV-specific CD4(+) T cells in elderly donors demonstrate decreased production of interleukin-2 and less dependence on costimulation. CMV seropositivity is associated with marked changes in the phenotype of the overall CD4(+) T-cell repertoire in healthy aged donors, including an increase in CD57(+) express…
1573400	The distribution of cathepsin D activity in adult and aging human brain regions.	aging	1992-06-??	We measured the activity of cathepsin D, the major cerebral protease, in 50 separate areas of the central nervous system of adult and aged humans, using hemoglobin as the substrate. The activity showed significant regional heterogeneity, with average differences of 50-100% between the lower and higher level areas, and a more than threefold difference between the lowest and highest levels. The forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain each had areas of high and low activity; cerebellum and cord areas were among those with low activity. Cathepsin levels tended to increase with age in about half of the areas analyzed, and the increases were significant in 14. Statistically significant decreases with aging were observed in two areas. The increases varied between 30 and 60%, and the decreases were 20%. Enzyme activity in thalamus, hypothalamus, pons, medulla, and cerebellum increased with age. In the ventrolateral medulla, which contains the major portion of the cerebral noradrenergic cells, the c…
18215727	Differences in sensitivity to cold in Japanese men and postmenopausal women aged &gt; or =50 years.	aging	2007-12-??	BACKGROUND: Sensitivity to cold is associated with several factors, such as aging, sex, and body composition. However, no previous studies have examined the differences in sensitivity to cold in men and women or the association of hormonal levels with sensitivity to cold.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to clarify both the change in sensitivity to cold with aging and the difference in sensitivity to cold between men and women. Associations were also examined between circulating hormonal concentrations and the changes with aging and differences in sensitivity.    METHODS: This population-based cohort study enrolled healthy Japanese men and women aged > or = 50 years. A standardized 210-item health questionnaire was used to obtain information on symptoms of sensitivity to cold. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured.    RE…
3624804	Secretion of antimicrobial proteins from the parotid glands of different aged healthy persons.	aging	1987-09-??	The secretion of three antimicrobial proteins from the parotid glands of 82 generally healthy men and women, 22 to 81 years in age, was examined. No change was observed in the levels of secretory IgA, but statistically significant, modest elevations (approximately 50 to 100%) of lactoferrin, in both unstimulated and stimulated secretions, and lysozyme, in unstimulated secretions, were detected when results were expressed as mg antimicrobial protein/100 ml saliva. However, these alterations were not observed if data were expressed as mg antimicrobial protein/g total protein. Also, no change was detected in an acinar cell exocrine product, the anionic proline-rich proteins, as reported previously by our laboratory. The data are consistent with a maintenance of protective functions in parotid saliva during aging.
9277556	Influence of age on the sympathetic neural adjustments to alterations in systemic oxygen levels in humans.	aging	1997-08-??	We tested the hypothesis that aging influences the regulation of sympathetic nervous system activity (SNA) and arterial blood pressure during alterations in systemic O2 levels in humans. To accomplish this, we performed direct (intraneural) measurements of SNA to skeletal muscle (MSNA) in 10 young and 7 older healthy normotensive men during room air breathing (normoxic-control), moderate isocapnic hypoxemia [15 min of 10% fractional inspired O2 (FIO2)], and hyperoxemia (10 min of 50% FIO2). After hypoxemia, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) declined similarly in the young and older men. MSNA (burst frequency and total minute activity) increased significantly (P < 0.05) in both groups. The magnitudes of the absolute increases in MSNA and the delta MSNA/delta SaO2 were not significantly different in the young and older men; however, because of higher normoxic baseline levels, the percentage increases in burst frequency were smaller (P = 0.02) and those for total minute activity tended to be …
8638697	Effect of aging on the metabolism of phosphorus and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in healthy men.	aging	1996-03-??	We tested the hypothesis that aging alters physiological regulation of the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] by inorganic phosphorus. In seven elderly men [age 71 +/- 1 (SE) yr] and 9 young men (29 +/- 2 yr), dietary phosphorus was first normal, then increased and decreased within its normal range. At each intake of phosphorus, serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D in the elderly did not differ from those in young men, but fasting and 24-h mean serum concentrations of phosphorus were lower in elderly men. With phosphorus restriction, in each group serum 1,25(OH)2D increased by 47%, and 24-h mean serum phosphorus decreased by 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/dl. Serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D varied inversely with 24-h mean serum phosphorus (R= -0.92, P<0.0001). Thus, in healthy elderly men in whom glomerular filtration rate is normal or near normal, serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D increase when dietary phosphorus is restricted; the magnitude of response at steady state is u…
20385663	Cognitive and neural contributors to emotion regulation in aging.	lifespan, aging	2011-04-??	Older adults, compared to younger adults, focus on emotional well-being. While the lifespan trajectory of emotional processing and its regulation has been characterized behaviorally, few studies have investigated the underlying neural mechanisms. Here, older adults (range: 59-73 years) and younger adults (range: 19-33 years) participated in a cognitive reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. On each trial, participants viewed positive, negative or neutral pictures and either naturally experienced the image ('Experience' condition) or attempted to detach themselves from the image ('Reappraise' condition). Across both age groups, cognitive reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in prior studies of emotion regulation, while emotional experience activated the bilateral amygdala. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and amygdala demonstrated greater inverse connectivity…
18330717	Proteasome activities in the rectus abdominis muscle of young and older individuals.	aging	2008-08-??	Sarcopenia is one of the most striking effects of age, the causes and the pathogenic mechanisms being largely unknown. Unfortunately, there is limited information on the effect of aging on muscle protein breakdown in basal conditions. The present study aimed at investigating if skeletal muscle ubiquitn mRNA levels and proteasome activities vary with age in healthy individuals. Ub mRNA levels were measured by northern blot analysis whereas proteasome activities were determined by evaluating the cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates in the rectus abdominis muscle of 14 healthy male individuals. Patients were divided in three groups according to the age: (1) 20-30 years (N = 3); (2) 31-64 years (N = 5); (3) > or = 65 years (N = 6). Quantitation of the ubiquitin mRNA levels (expressed in arbitrary units) (mean (SD) showed no differences among the three groups of age (20-30 years: 1352 +/- 441; 31-64 years: 1324 +/- 439; > or = 65 years: 884 +/- 400; P = 0.33). The correlation between…
23135380	Coagulation factors and antithrombin levels in young and elderly subjects in Pakistani population.	aging	2012-12-??	Aging is associated with increased levels of coagulation factors and decrease in natural anticoagulant factors. This strongly supports that age-related hypercoagulable state occurs in elderly. This study aimed to measure the plasma levels of coagulation factors and anticoagulant levels in young and elderly to observe the effect of age on haemostatic system. Ninety healthy individuals, both men and women were divided into two groups on the basis of age. Group I included participants of less than 40 years of age, whereas, group II comprised of participants more than 60 years of age. Fibrinogen activity was assessed by using Clauss technique. Coagulation factor VII, and factor VIII activity by corresponding one stage assay based on prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. Antithrombin III was measured by the chromogenic method. Our results showed that significantly increased levels of fibrinogen (P = 0.001) were observed in the elderly population as compared to young. H…
8285844	Aging and sexual function in men.	aging	1993-12-??	Sexual function, and in particular erectile capacity, declines with age in men. The present study attempted to identify possible sensory/neural and autonomic factors related to this decline. Data on self-reported sexual activity and functioning, as well as erectile response to visual erotic stimulation, were gathered from 39 healthy, sexually functional men ranging in age from 21 to 82. In addition, four parameters of putative significance to sexual functioning were measured: penile electrical and vibrotactile thresholds, pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials, penile autonomic response to ischemia, and blood testosterone. Results indicated significant age-related decreases in self-reported frequency of sexual activity and in erectile response to erotica. Furthermore, penile sensitivity, response to penile ischemia, and somatosensory evoked potentials showed age-related changes. In contrast, self-reported erectile capacity, ratings of overall sex life, and levels of testosterone did …
12228106	Senior mentor program: a geriatrics focused curriculum.	aging	2002-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To introduce medical students to a healthy elderly population and present the health care challenges in this population.    DESCRIPTION: As medical education has begun to focus more on our aging population and their future health needs, the University of South Carolina School of Medicine has developed a senior mentor program. This program provides a longitudinal experience for undergraduate students with local elders. The program, currently in its second year, will provide multiple opportunities for students to follow their same senior mentors over a four-year period both in the home and in the clinical setting. In partnership with the division of geriatrics, healthy patients over 65 were recruited to serve as senior mentors. Students, mostly in pairs, were assigned either one senior mentor or a couple, whom they met for the first time at the beginning of the second semester of their first year. Using a multidisciplinary approach, modules have been developed so students can …
10806044	Influence of aging on the synthesis and morphology of the aggrecans synthesized by differentiated human articular chondrocytes.	aging	2000-05-??	OBJECTIVE: Synthesis rates of aggrecans by phenotypically stable human articular chondrocytes and the immobilization of these aggrecans in large aggregates were used as variables reflecting the capability of these cells of restoring the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in vivo in an aging population.    DESIGN: Human articular chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage obtained from 33 different donors at autopsy. The chondrocytes were cultured in gelled agarose. Synthesis of aggrecans was investigated using Na(2)(35)SO(4)as a radioactive precursor after a 2-week culture period. Electron microscopic study of aggrecan aggregates was done on the macromolecules accumulated over 3 weeks in culture by the chondrocytes obtained from eight other donors with increasing ages.    RESULTS: Sulfate incorporation rates into aggrecans correlated inversely with the age of the donor. The value of sulfate incorporation in aggrecans for chondrocytes obtained from mature cartilage of …
27108355	The EpiTect Methyl qPCR Assay as novel age estimation method in forensic biology.	lifespan, aging	2016-??-??	Human aging is associated with epigenetic modification of the genome. DNA methylation at cytosines appears currently as the best characterised modification that occurs during the mammalian lifetime. Such methylation changes at regulatory region can provide insights to track contributor age for criminal investigation. The EpiTect Methyl II PCR system (QIAGEN) was used to compare methylation levels of CpG islands in the promoter regions of a number of age related genes, of which four successfully showed changes across the lifespan (NPTX2, KCNQ1DN, GRIA2 and TRIM58). This technique is based on the detection of remaining input genome after digestion with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. This study examined DNA specimens from 80 female subjects of various ages (18-91 years) obtained from blood, using primers designed to flank the studied gene loci. The data obtained from DNA methylation quantification showed successful discrimination among volunteered ages. Overall, the differenc…
12470828	Replicative senescence of human fibroblasts: the role of Ras-dependent signaling and oxidative stress.	aging	????-??-??	Replicative senescence of human fibroblasts is a widely used cellular model for human aging. While it is clear that telomere erosion contributes to the development of replicative senescence, it is assumed that additional factors contribute to the senescent phenotype. The free radical theory of aging suggests that oxidative damage is a major cause of aging; furthermore, the expression of activated oncogenes, such as oncogenic Ras, can induce premature senescence in primary cells. The functional relation between the various inducers of senescence is not known. The present study was guided by the hypothesis that constitutive activation of normal, unmutated Ras may contribute to senescence-induced growth arrest in senescent human fibroblasts. When various branches of Ras-dependent signaling were investigated, constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was not observed. To evaluate the role of oxidative stress for the senescent phenotype, we also investigated stress-related prot…
6738363	A pedigree of homozygous familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia.	longevity	1984-07-??	A new form of familial lipoprotein disorder, homozygous hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP) was studied in one pedigree through three generations. The proband was a healthy male, 50 years old, who was checked for a distinctive elevation of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in a routine screening examination. An intensive family study revealed that the proband and one of his sisters were homozygotic carriers of familial HALP judging by their extremely high concentration of HDL-C (181 mg/dL and 163 mg/dL, respectively). In the homozygotes, the lipid composition of HDL was found to be normal while the ratio of HDL lipids to apoproteins A-I and A-II tended to be increased. All five children of the two homozygous individuals and two additional first degree relatives were considered to be heterozygous, since their HDL-C values were moderately elevated, with other lipid levels being normal. The family study thus substantiated the hypothesis, as Glueck et al insisted in 1975, th…
6662209	Variation in proportion and molecular weight of native crystallins from single human lenses upon aging and formation of nuclear cataract.	aging	1983-12-??	Extracts of water-soluble proteins from cortex and nucleus of single human lenses have been analyzed by high-pressure gel permeation chromatography in combination with a size- and a concentration-sensitive detector. Using this rapid and accurate method, changes in molecular weight and proportion of the native crystallins upon aging and formation of nuclear cataract are observed. In the range from 30 to about 40 years the gamma-crystallin content of normal lenses increases and that of alpha-crystallin decreases; over 40 years the level of gamma-crystallin decreases and that of alpha-crystallin remains constant in the cortex (11%) as well as in the nucleus (1-2%). These changes are accompanied by an increase in the water-insoluble fraction. With progressing nuclear cataract an increase in beta 3- and a drastic decrease in gamma-crystallin content, especially in the nucleus, are accompanied by a steep increase in the water-insoluble fraction. The molecular weights of the crystallins do no…
16098029	Creatine supplementation normalizes mutagenesis of mitochondrial DNA as well as functional consequences.	aging	2005-08-??	Mutations of mitochondrial (mt) DNA play a role in neurodegeneration, normal aging, premature aging of the skin (photoaging), and tumors. We and others could demonstrate that mtDNA mutations can be induced in skin cells in vitro and in normal human skin in vivo by repetitive, sublethal ultraviolet (UV)-A-irradiation. These mutations are mediated by singlet oxygen and persist in human skin as long-term biomarkers of UV exposure. Although mtDNA exclusively encodes for the respiratory chain, involvement of the energy metabolism in mtDNA mutagenesis and a protective role of the energy precursor creatine have thus far not been shown. We assessed the amount of a marker mutation of mtDNA, the so-called common deletion, by real-time PCR. Induction of the common deletion was paralleled by a measurable decrease of oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP content, as well as an increase of matrix metalloproteinase-1. Mitochondrial mutagenesis as well as functional consequence…
18171926	Systems neuroplasticity in the aging brain: recruiting additional neural resources for successful motor performance in elderly persons.	aging	2008-01-02	Functional imaging studies have shown that seniors exhibit more elaborate brain activation than younger controls while performing motor tasks. Here, we investigated whether this age-related overactivation reflects compensation or dedifferentiation mechanisms. "Compensation" refers to additional activation that counteracts age-related decline of brain function and supports successful performance, whereas "dedifferentiation" reflects age-related difficulties in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms and is not relevant to task performance. To test these predictions, performance on a complex interlimb coordination task was correlated with brain activation. Findings revealed that coordination resulted in activation of classical motor coordination regions, but also higher-level sensorimotor regions, and frontal regions in the elderly. Interestingly, a positive correlation between activation level in these latter regions and motor performance was observed in the elderly. This performance e…
22484520	Age differences in default and reward networks during processing of personally relevant information.	aging	2012-06-??	We recently found activity in default mode and reward-related regions during self-relevant tasks in young adults. Here we examine the effect of aging on engagement of the default network (DN) and reward network (RN) during these tasks. Previous studies have shown reduced engagement of the DN and reward areas in older adults, but the influence of age on these circuits during self-relevant tasks has not been examined. The tasks involved judging personality traits about one's self or a well known other person. There were no age differences in reaction time on the tasks but older adults had more positive Self and Other judgments, whereas younger adults had more negative judgments. Both groups had increased DN and RN activity during the self-relevant tasks, relative to non-self tasks, but this increase was reduced in older compared to young adults. Functional connectivity of both networks during the tasks was weaker in the older relative to younger adults. Intrinsic functional connectivity,…
3913513	Abnormalities in blood pressure homeostasis that contribute to falls in the elderly.	aging	1985-08-??	Aging is associated with abnormalities in blood pressure homeostasis and may precipitate falls through transient underperfusion of the brain. Age-related declines in baro-reflex sensitivity, cerebral blood flow, and renal sodium conservation threaten normal blood pressure regulation and cerebral perfusion. Common clinical conditions associated with abnormal blood pressure homeostasis and falls in the elderly include postural hypotension, postprandial hypotension, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and cardiac arrhythmias, all of which are exacerbated by hypertension. Further research is needed to understand the physiologic basis of abnormal blood pressure homeostasis, to explore the potential relationship between hypertension and falling, and to design new therapeutic approaches to this important cause of falls in the elderly.
12030826	Functional MRI of global and local processing in children.	aging	2002-06-??	Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine developmental change in hemispheric biases for globally and locally directed analysis of hierarchical forms. In a previous reaction time (RT) study, which presented hierarchical stimuli to the visual hemifields, children 7 to 14 years of age demonstrated an emerging pattern of hemispheric differences. Initially children analyzed local elements more slowly, without a strongly lateralized advantage for local or global level processing. With age, children's development was marked by a left hemisphere advantage for local level processing that resembled an adult's and a trend toward a right hemisphere advantage for global. In the current study, 20 children 12 to 14 years old were imaged during attend-global and attend-local conditions to determine whether the developmental change in cognitive measures corresponded to a change in distribution of functional activation. Children formed two groups based on their RT performance, immature-…
18464249	Chemotaxis of human articular chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells.	aging	2008-10-??	Migration of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be important in cartilage development, tissue response to injury, and in tissue engineering. This study analyzed growth factors and cytokines for their ability to induce migration of human articular chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in Boyden chamber assays. In human articular chondrocytes serum induced dose- and time-dependent increases in cell migration. Among a series of growth factors and cytokines tested only PDGF induced a significant increase in cell migration. The PDGF isoforms AB and BB were more potent than AA. There was an aging-related decline in the ability of chondrocytes to migrate in response to serum and PDGF. Human bone marrow MSC showed significant chemotaxis responses to several factors, including FBS, PDGF, VEGF, IGF-1, IL-8, BMP-4, and BMP-7. In summary, these results demonstrate that directed cell migration is inducible in human articular chondrocytes and MSC. PDGF is the mo…
22855822	Opposing effects of aging on large-scale brain systems for memory encoding and cognitive control.	aging	2012-08-01	Episodic memory declines with advancing age. Neuroimaging studies have associated such decline to age-related changes in general cognitive-control networks as well as to changes in process-specific encoding or retrieval networks. To assess the specific influence of aging on encoding and retrieval processes and associated brain systems, it is vital to dissociate encoding and retrieval from each other and from shared cognitive-control processes. We used multivariate partial-least-squares to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a large population-based sample (n = 292, 25-80 years). The participants performed a face-name paired-associates task and an active baseline task. The analysis revealed two significant network patterns. The first reflected a process-general encoding-retrieval network that included frontoparietal cortices and posterior hippocampus. The second pattern dissociated encoding and retrieval networks. The anterior hippocampus was differentially engaged d…
3982085	Increasing skeletal involution in the elderly?	aging	1985-01-??	Studies of bone mineral content (MC) of the limbs in normal populations have shown there is an increase of MC during adolescence, a maximum MC for both sexes between 30 and 40 years of age and a subsequent decrease which is at least twice as great in females than in males. There are different findings in the literature on the course of these MC changes with aging. The present cross-sectional study of 180 subjects over age 70 showed a slight increase in the annual decrease of radius MC in females and a distinct acceleration of the MC decrease in males after about 80 years. This occurred for both a pure cortical measuring site of the radius (1/3-site) and for a mixed cancellous/compact site of the distal radius (1/10-site). These findings differ from those in other populations.
23233880	Centenarians, but not octogenarians, up-regulate the expression of microRNAs.	longevity	2012-??-??	Centenarians exhibit extreme longevity and a remarkable compression of morbidity. They have a unique capacity to maintain homeostatic mechanisms. Since small non-coding RNAs (including microRNAs) are implicated in the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesised that longevity of centenarians may reflect alterations in small non-coding RNA expression. We report the first comparison of microRNAs expression profiles in mononuclear cells from centenarians, octogenarians and young individuals resident near Valencia, Spain. Principal Component Analysis of the expression of 15,644 mature microRNAs and, 2,334 snoRNAs and scaRNAs in centenarians revealed a significant overlap with profiles in young individuals but not with octogenarians and a significant up-regulation of 7 small non-coding RNAs in centenarians compared to young persons and notably 102 small non-coding RNAs when compared with octogenarians. We suggest that the small non-coding RNAs signature in centenarians may provide insigh…
23302660	Decline in cognitive function over 18 months in healthy older adults with high amyloid-β.	aging	2013-??-??	We aimed to characterize the nature and magnitude of cognitive decline in a group of healthy older adults with high and low levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and who were APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers. Healthy older adults underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging for Aβ, APOE genotyping, and cognitive and clinical assessment as part of their baseline assessment in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle study. Cognitive function and clinical ratings were reassessed 18 months later. Linear mixed model analyses adjusted for baseline cognitive function indicated that relative to healthy older adults with low Aβ, healthy older adults with high Aβ showed greater decline in episodic memory and language at 18 months. No decline on any measure of executive function, attention, or clinical rating was observed for healthy older adults with high Aβ levels. Compared to non-carriers, APOE ε4 carriers showed a greater decline only on the task of visual memory at the 18 month assessmen…
25153322	Cross-country differences in basal and stress-induced cortisol secretion in older adults.	aging	2014-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Several studies have emphasized the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and inadequate response of the biological stress system. However, other factors related to SES are rarely considered, such as cultural values, social norms, organization, language and communication skills, which raises the need to investigate cross-country differences in stress response. Although some studies have shown differences in cortisol levels between immigrants and natives, there is no cross-country evidence regarding cortisol levels in country-native elders. This is particularly important given the high prevalence of stress-related disorders across nations during aging. The current study examined basal diurnal and reactive cortisol levels in healthy older adults living in two different countries.    METHODS: Salivary cortisol of 260 older adults from Canada and Brazil were analyzed. Diurnal cortisol was measured in saliva samples collected at home throughout two working days at awaken…
12221051	Aging and forearm postjunctional alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction in healthy men.	aging	2002-09-10	BACKGROUND: Muscle sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity increases with age in healthy humans but does not result in an augmented forearm vasoconstrictor tone. We tested the hypothesis that this is due to a reduction in postjunctional alpha-adrenergic responsiveness to endogenous norepinephrine (NE) release and determined whether this was specific to alpha1- or alpha2-adrenergic receptors.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Forearm blood flow (FBF, by strain-gauge plethysmography) responses to local intra-arterial infusions of tyramine (which evokes endogenous NE release), phenylephrine (selective alpha1-agonist), and clonidine (alpha2-agonist) were determined in 10 young (aged 26+/-1 [mean+/-SEM] years) and 10 older (aged 65+/-1 years) healthy normotensive men after local beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Basal forearm vascular tone was not different in young men and older men. The percentage reduction in FBF in response to the highest dose of tyramine was blunted in older men comp…
7935087	The mitochondrial F1-ATPase and the aging process.	aging	1994-06-??	A progressive dysfunction of the mitochondrion probably plays a decisive role in the aging process. In the present hypothesis it is suggested that the functional defect specifically concerns the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase. This proposal is based on observations concerning two classical models of the aging process. 1. The Werner syndrome of premature aging is autosomally recessive; meaning that this disorder--in analogy with other recessive inborn errors of metabolism--results from a single specific mutation, typically resulting in an enzyme defect. 2. The strong association between the ATPase activity of the SV40 T-antigen and the process of cellular immortalization in vitro, suggests that the putative enzyme dysfunction could concern an ATPase. The decrease with aging in the activity of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase--the main producer of ATP--could lay behind the progressive lack of homeostasis observed in senescence.
14695918	Specificity of coenzyme Q inhibition of an aging-related cell surface NADH oxidase (ECTO-NOX) that generates superoxide.	aging	2003-??-??	Our laboratories have described a novel class of ectoproteins at the cell surface with both NADH or hydroquinone oxidase (NOX) and protein disulfide-thiol interchange activities (ECTO-NOX proteins). The two activities exhibited by these proteins alternate to generate characteristic patterns of oscillations where the period length is independent of temperature. The period length for the constitutive ECTO-NOX is 24 min. Here we describe a distinctive age-related ECTO-NOX (arNOX) whose activity is blocked by coenzyme Q10. arNOX occurs exclusively in aged cells and tissues. The period length of the oscillations is 26 min. Rather than reducing 1/2 O2 to H2O, electrons are transferred to O2 to form superoxide. Superoxide formation was demonstrated by superoxide dismutase-sensitive reduction of ferricytochrome c and by reduction of a superoxide-specific tetrazolium salt. Quinone inhibition was given by coenzymes Q8, 9 and Q10 but not by Q0, Q2, Q4, Q6 or 7. The arNOX provides a mechanism to p…
11053667	Age-related alterations of proteasome structure and function in aging epidermis.	aging	2000-09-??	Recent studies on the effect of aging in epidermal cells have evidenced a decrease of proteasome activity and content, suggesting that proteasome is down-regulated in aged cells. The 20S proteasome is the major proteolytic system that has been implicated in removal of abnormal and oxidatively damaged proteins. Therefore, a decreased proteasome content may explain, at least in part, the well-documented age-related accumulation of oxidized proteins. To gain further insight in other mechanisms that may be implicated in a decreased activity of the proteasome with age, 20S proteasome has been purified from the epidermis from donors of different ages: young, middle-aged and old. The patterns of proteasome subunits have been analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis to determine whether its structure is also affected with age. The 2D gel pattern of proteasome subunits was found to be modified for four subunits, indicating that the observed decline in proteasome activity with age may also be related …
11940692	Serum thyroxine level and cognitive decline in euthyroid older women.	aging	2002-04-09	BACKGROUND: Clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with cognitive impairment.    OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between thyroxine (T(4)) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and change over time in cognitive performance in a sample of older women with normal thyroid gland function.    METHODS: T(4) and TSH were measured at baseline in 628 women (> or = 65 years) enrolled in the Women's Health and Aging Study, a community-based study of physically impaired women. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 years, using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Incident cognitive decline was defined as a decrease of more than one point/year in MMSE score between baseline and the end of the follow-up. The analysis included 464 subjects with normal thyroid gland function with a baseline and at least one follow-up MMSE.    RESULTS: At baseline there was no association between T(4) and TSH level and cognitive function. In longit…
2627924	Beta-carotene serum response in young and elderly females.	aging	1989-11-??	This study was designed to investigate the effects of aging and food intake on the serum beta-carotene (BC) response curve in humans. Ten elderly (71 +/- 4 years) and 17 young (28 +/- 7 years) healthy females were given 15 mg BC with a semi-solid test meal devoid of BC and vitamin A. All the elderly and 10 young subjects (control A) received a test meal of 500 kcal while the remaining 7 young subjects (control B) were given 700 kcal. Subsequently, blood was drawn hourly for 8 h and again at 24 and 48 h. Serum carotenoids and retinoids were measured by HPLC and triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol by enzymatic methods. Small intestinal transit time was determined in the elderly and in control group A by a breath hydrogen test following ingestion of lactulose (12 g) with the test meal. The area under the absorption curve (AUC) of serum BC over the first 8 h was higher in the elderly subjects than in either control group A or B (P less than 0.001). The slopes of the BC and TG curves were si…
20416122	Do circadian rhythms affect adult age-related differences in auditory performance?	aging	2010-06-??	Time-of-day effects have been identified as a possible confound in research on age-related differences in cognitive performance. Circadian rhythms have been related to time-of-day variations in sensory measures; however, more is known about the effect of circadian rhythms on vision than on hearing, and virtually nothing is known about whether time-of-day effects are potential confounds in studies of auditory aging. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether age-related differences in performance on auditory tasks are affected by time of day. A set of four auditory experiments was repeated three times over the course of one day with a group of Evening-type younger adults and a group of Morning-type older adults. The results replicated previous findings of age-related differences, but time of day did not affect the basic results. Thus, time of day does not confound the results observed in typical laboratory experiments investigating auditory aging.
1918782	Daytime sleepiness in the healthy "old old": a comparison with young adults.	aging	1991-10-??	OBJECTIVE: To determine if excessive daytime sleepiness is an inevitable consequence of aging.    METHODS: Daytime sleepiness was measured using Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT's) before and after a night of total sleep deprivation in a sample of 22 healthy men and women in their eighties and 29 men and women in their twenties.    RESULTS: Young adults were somewhat sleepier than elders, as measured by rapidity of sleep onset during daytime nap recordings using the MSLT, and showed a higher incidence of REM sleep during naps. However, recovery from the effects of acute sleep loss was slower in the elderly, judging from the presence of more daytime sleepiness 2 days after a night of total sleep deprivation. Such persistent sleepiness was absent in the young adult control group.    CONCLUSIONS: Healthy persons in late old age may have a level of daytime sleepiness no greater than, and perhaps even less than, that seen in healthy young adults.
1485708	The response of human lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin is impaired at different levels during aging.	aging	1992-12-26	Several parameters generally believed to be necessary for the activation and progression of proliferation of human lymphocytes have been investigated and compared with special reference to aging. The responding capacity of plasma membrane potential to depolarizing and also repolarizing conditions induced by exposure to mitogens like PHA was lower in lymphocytes from old donors as compared to those of young ones. This indicates a significant age-dependent difference in the readiness to respond to channel-activating perturbations. As an early signal of activation, after one hour PHA stimulation the merocyanine 540 uptake by the lipid regions was chosen, based on the property of this fluorescent probe to bind to loosely packed lipids of the plasma membrane. The proteins encoded by the c-myc and c-myb genes were chosen as markers of the G0/G1 and G1/S phased transition, respectively. The mean number of cells that increased the uptake of MC 540 following mitogenic stimulation did not differ…
12859149	Betacarotene supplementation protects from photoaging-associated mitochondrial DNA mutation.	aging	2003-06-??	Mutations of mitochondrial DNA accumulate during normal aging and can be detected at elevated levels in skin prematurely aged by chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light (photoaging). In normal human fibroblasts, we have previously demonstrated that mtDNA deletions are induced by repetitive exposure to sublethal doses of UVA radiation mediated through singlet oxygen. Betacarotene is a known quencher of ROS and singlet oxygen in particular, and it is widely applied in photoprotective compounds. Therefore we investigated whether in our in vitro system, betacarotene is capable of protecting from the induction of photoaging-associated mtDNA deletions. All-E (trans) betacarotene was tested at doses from 0.25 to 3.0 microM for uptake into cells as well as its protective capacity. Assessment of cellular uptake of all-E betacarotene measured by HPLC revealed a dose dependent increase of intracellular concentrations, as well as an increase in oxidative metabolites. UVA-exposure led to a decre…
6871757	Cortical bone senescence and mineral bone density of the humerus.	aging	1983-05-??	Study of the humeral cortex of 89 acute cadavers showed that an important factor contributing to the physiologic bone loss of aging is increasing bone porosity. Mean cortical porosity increases in both sexes with age, from 4.6% in men and 4% in women at 40 years of age to 10% and more at age 80. In the population studied, no significant difference of porosity was observed between men and women. Apparent mineral density is linked to porosity, and decreases markedly with age in women. Changes in men are lesser in magnitude and show a larger difference of density values. Correction of the apparent mineral density, by a factor reflecting the proportion of vascular and resorption spaces in the cortical bone, produces a true mineral density which does not vary significantly with age in either sex. The density values obtained for the proximal humerus differ from those in the literature which represent the femur. However, they are more readily compared with the results of clinical densitometry…
7803600	Cortisol suppression by dexamethasone in the healthy elderly: effects of age, dexamethasone levels, and cognitive function.	aging	1994-09-15	The effects of age, cognitive function (measured by Cambridge cognitive examination (CAM-COG) score); and dexamethasone (DEX) levels on the dexamethasone suppression test were studied in 33 healthy older subjects (age 51-96). Three subjects (9.1%) were nonsuppressors and were older and had lower CAMCOG scores than the 30 suppressors. Significant correlations were observed between natural log-transformed postdexamethasone cortisol (LNCOR) levels and age (r = 0.40) and CAMCOG score (r = -0.45). Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between LNCOR, age, DEX levels, and CAMCOG score. Age and DEX combined explained 41% of the variance in LNCOR values, whereas CAMCOG score and DEX levels explained 44% variance. As age and CAMCOG were highly correlated (r = -0.72), both together did not significantly improve the fit of regression equation (47% variance explained). These findings suggest an association between advancing age, impaired glucocorticoid feedback, and …
17019379	Monitoring reproductive aging in a 5-year prospective study: aggregate and individual changes in luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone with age.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: This study describes age-related changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in a 5-year prospective study of reproductive aging.    DESIGN: Participants (n = 156 college-educated, white, US women; 25 to 58 y) were recruited from the TREMIN Research Program on Women's Health. They collected daily urine specimens for 6 months in each of 5 consecutive years. Specimens were assayed for LH and FSH. Aggregate changes were calculated in LH and FSH with age, and multilevel models were used to estimate individual hormone trajectories and within-woman and between-woman variances by age.    RESULTS: Aggregate LH levels increased beginning after age 45; FSH increased at all ages, accelerating after age 45. Individual-level patterns with age included the following: reproductive-age LH and FSH levels, with increasing FSH and increasing or decreasing LH (ages 20 to 49); rapidly increasing LH and FSH (ages 40 to 59); and increasing or steady postmenopausal LH…
24242271	Multiple time scale complexity analysis of resting state FMRI.	aging	2014-06-??	The present study explored multi-scale entropy (MSE) analysis to investigate the entropy of resting state fMRI signals across multiple time scales. MSE analysis was developed to distinguish random noise from complex signals since the entropy of the former decreases with longer time scales while the latter signal maintains its entropy due to a "self-resemblance" across time scales. A long resting state BOLD fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan with 1000 data points was performed on five healthy young volunteers to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of entropy across multiple time scales. A shorter rs-fMRI scan with 240 data points was performed on a cohort of subjects consisting of healthy young (age 23 ± 2 years, n = 8) and aged volunteers (age 66 ± 3 years, n = 8) to investigate the effect of healthy aging on the entropy of rs-fMRI. The results showed that MSE of gray matter, rather than white matter, resembles closely that of f (-1) noise over multiple time scales. By filtering out …
21653286	The architecture of cross-hemispheric communication in the aging brain: linking behavior to functional and structural connectivity.	aging	2012-01-??	Contralateral recruitment remains a controversial phenomenon in both the clinical and normative populations. To investigate the neural correlates of this phenomenon, we explored the tendency for older adults to recruit prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions contralateral to those most active in younger adults. Participants were scanned with diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic rresonance imaging during a lateralized word matching task (unilateral vs. bilateral). Cross-hemispheric communication was measured behaviorally as greater accuracy for bilateral than unilateral trials (bilateral processing advantage [BPA]) and at the neural level by functional and structural connectivity between contralateral PFC. Compared with the young, older adults exhibited 1) greater BPAs in the behavioral task, 2) greater compensatory activity in contralateral PFC during the bilateral condition, 3) greater functional connectivity between contralateral PFC during bilateral trials, and 4) a positive cor…
28656072	Impact of Aging and Exercise on Mitochondrial Quality Control in Skeletal Muscle.	aging	2017-??-??	Mitochondria are characterized by its pivotal roles in managing energy production, reactive oxygen species, and calcium, whose aging-related structural and functional deteriorations are observed in aging muscle. Although it is still unclear how aging alters mitochondrial quality and quantity in skeletal muscle, dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamic controls has been suggested as key players for that. In this paper, we summarize current understandings on how aging regulates muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, while focusing on transcriptional regulations including PGC-1, AMPK, p53, mtDNA, and Tfam. Further, we review current findings on the muscle mitochondrial dynamic systems in aging muscle: fusion/fission, autophagy/mitophagy, and protein import. Next, we also discuss how endurance and resistance exercises impact on the mitochondrial quality controls in aging muscle, suggesting possible effective exercise strategies to improve/maintain mitochondrial health.
24471567	Association between sex steroid levels and bone microarchitecture in men: the STRAMBO study.	aging	2014-04-??	CONTEXT: Data on the association between bone microarchitecture assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and sex steroids in men are scarce.    OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the association between serum sex steroids and bone microarchitecture assessed by HR-pQCT in men.    DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional analysis in the Structure of the Aging Men's Bones cohort.    SETTING: The cohort was recruited from the general population.    PARTICIPANTS: We examined 1169 male volunteers aged 20-87 years. No specific exclusion criteria were used.    INTERVENTIONS: We collected blood samples and performed HR-pQCT at the distal radius and distal tibia.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We tested the hypothesis that low sex steroid levels are associated with poor bone microarchitecture in men.    RESULTS: Men aged younger than 65 years with bioavailable 17β-estradiol (bio-17β-E2) levels of14.4 pmol/L or less had higher cross-sectional and trabecular areas vs …
29779740	The influence of sensorimotor experience on the aesthetic evaluation of dance across the life span.	aging	2018-??-??	Understanding how action perception, embodiment, and emotion interact is essential for advancing knowledge about how we perceive and interact with each other in a social world. One tool that has proved particularly useful in the past decade for exploring the relationship between perception, action, and affect is dance. Dance is, in its essence, a rich and multisensory art form that can be used to help answer not only basic questions about social cognition but also questions concerning how aging shapes the relationship between action perception, and the role played by affect, emotion, and aesthetics in social perception. In the present study, we used a 1-week physical and visual dance training paradigm to instill varying degrees of sensorimotor experience among non-dancers from three distinct age groups (early adolescents, young adults, and older adults). Our aim was to begin to build an understanding of how aging influences the relationship between action embodiment and affective (or a…
18589506	Age-related differences in medial prefrontal activation in response to emotional images.	aging	2008-06-??	Research has suggested that aging results in a "positivity effect," with young adults dwelling on negative information, and older adults attending to positive information. In order to understand age-related changes in emotional processing underlying this effect, the present fMRI study compared neural activity in young and older adults as they viewed positive, negative, and neutral images. Results indicated a striking age-related reversal in the valence of information eliciting activity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Negative in comparison with positive images activated the VMPFC more for young adults, whereas positive in comparison with negative images activated the VMPFC more for the older adults. The VMPFC is a region associated with the processing of emotional information, and more specifically, with emotion generation and emotion regulation. Therefore, the present results suggest that age-related changes in these processes implemented by the VMPFC contribute to …
16531899	Chemoreflex and metaboreflex responses to static hypoxic exercise in aging humans.	aging	2006-02-??	PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that aging decreases the contribution of metaboreceptors to sympathetic responses during exercise in hypoxia.    METHODS: We recorded sympathetic nerve traffic to muscle circulation (MSNA), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), minute ventilation (VE), and blood lactate (BL) in 12 older (55 +/- 10 yr) and 12 younger (22 +/- 2 yr) normal subjects during three randomized interventions: isocapnic hypoxia (chemoreflex activation), isometric handgrip exercise (HG) in normoxia (metaboreflex activation), and HG during isocapnic hypoxia (concomitant metaboreflex and chemoreflex activation). All interventions were followed by a forearm circulatory arrest period to allow metaboreflex activation in the absence of exercise and chemoreflex activation.    RESULTS: Older subjects had higher resting MSNA (38 +/- 12 vs 23 +/- 9 bursts per minute; P < 0.01) and BP (P < 0.001). Heart rate, minute ventilation, and blood lactate did not differ (all P > 0.5). MSNA responses…
17551487	Human studies of growth hormone and aging.	aging	2007-03-??	During the last 50 years a 20-year increase in the average life span was observed, and the average life span worldwide is expected to increase by another 10 years by 2050 (1). Enhancing "healthy aging" and thus extending the time that the elderly are able to maintain their independence is a high priority. One of the major causes of dysfunction and disability in the elderly is loss of muscle mass and muscle strength - sarcopenia. We will review some of the aspects of sarcopenia in the elderly and arguments in favor and against GH replacement in the elderly. Since the study of Rudman and colleagues (2) was published there has been great interest in the role of the decline of growth hormone secretion observed during aging. The rationale and the basis for the hypothesis will be described and then we will discuss the results of clinical studies which to date have not demonstrated a clear clinical benefit of growth hormone replacement in normal aging subjects.
19675552	Role of mitochondria in photoaging of human skin: the defective powerhouse model.	aging	2009-08-??	The exact pathogenesis of photoaging of the skin is not yet known. Earlier, a number of molecular pathways explaining one or more characteristics of photoaged skin have been described, but a unifying mechanistic concept is still missing. Here we propose the "Defective Powerhouse Model of Premature Skin Aging", which reconciles most of the earlier conducted research as one concept. In this model, the persistence of UV radiation-induced mtDNA deletions or the infrared radiation-induced disturbance of the electron flow of the mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to inadequate energy production in dermal fibroblasts. As a consequence of this defective powerhouse, retrograde mitochondrial signaling pathways are triggered that then they transduce functional and structural alterations in the skin. This model, which is supported by a growing number of recent studies, is of direct clinical importance in preventing and treating photoaging in human skin.Journal of Investigative Dermatolog…
25780934	Subclinical hypothyroidism might worsen the effects of aging on serum lipid profiles: a population-based case-control study.	aging	2015-05-??	BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is an important global health problem, particularly in the elderly population. Traditionally, the high prevalence of dyslipidemia in elderly people is considered a "natural condition." Notably, subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is one of the most important risk factors for dyslipidemia. Few studies have assessed whether SCH plays a role in the increase in age-related dyslipidemia. This study aimed to explore the association between SCH and lipid profiles in different age groups.    METHODS: This was a large-scale, population-based, case-control study. The population was derived from the REACTION study conducted across China. A total of 17,046 individuals (8827 cases and 8219 controls) aged 40 years or older were enrolled in the final analyses. The relationships between SCH and serum lipid parameters in each age group were evaluated after adjustment for thyroid hormones and common confounding factors.    RESULTS: In the entire population, thyrotropin (TSH), the k…
17115893	Higher leukocyte 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and lower plasma ascorbate in aging humans?	aging	2007-01-??	Is oxidative damage of DNA responsible for physiological changes associated with aging? The authors note a positive correlation between the age of human subjects with the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in leukocyte DNA. The levels of urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine and 8-oxodG followed the same pattern of correlation. Age-dependent decline in the concentration of plasma vitamin C was also evident. These interesting observations in humans point towards the need to scrutinize in detail the role of oxidative DNA damage and compromised antioxidant defense systems in age-related physiological disorders.
16769093	Neural correlates of auditory recognition under full and divided attention in younger and older adults.	aging	2006-??-??	We examined how aging affects the pattern of brain activity mediating retrieval under dual-task conditions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in younger and older adults while they were engaged in an auditory verbal recognition test under either full or divided attention (FA or DA). During recognition under FA, older adults had more activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). DA with a distracting task requiring animacy judgments to words disrupted memory more than did a task requiring odd-digit judgments to numbers. For both behavioural and brain measures we contrasted the two DA conditions to recognition under FA to identify interference with memory performance. Behaviourally, there were no age differences in the magnitude of memory interference from DA conditions, although recognition performance was poorer overall in older adults. During the DA animacy condition, younger adults showed an increase in recognition latency, a…
28107400	When Contact Is Not Enough: Affecting First Year Medical Students' Image towards Older Persons.	aging	2017-??-??	CONTEXT: Many medical schools have initiated care internships to familiarize their students with older persons and to instil a professional attitude.    OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of care internships on the image that first-year medical students have of older persons and to explore the underlying concepts that may play a role in shaping this image.    DESIGN: Survey before and after a two-week compulsory care internship using the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD; 32 adjectives) and the Attitudes toward Old People (AOP; 34 positions) questionnaires.    PARTICIPANTS: Before and after a care internship involving interpersonal contact, 252 and 244 first-year medical students at the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) in the academic year 2012-2013 participated.    METHOD: Descriptive statistics, analyses of variance, and principal component analysis were used; clusters of adjectives and positions were reduced into concepts to examine dominant patterns of views. Changes in image w…
25081108	Structural investigation of donor age effect on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells: FTIR spectroscopy and imaging.	aging	2014-??-??	Stem cell studies hold enormous potential for development of new therapies for tissue regeneration and repair. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can differentiate into a variety of non-hematopoietic tissues and contribute maintenance of healthy hematopoiesis by providing supportive cellular microenvironment into BM. Here, we investigated age-related differences in BM-MSCs by using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and FTIR imaging together with hierarchical clustering as a novel methods to clarify global alterations in the structure and function of macromolecules in characterized BM-MSCs of different aged donors. The results may contribute to identification of age-related new molecular marker(s) to determine the effects of donor age on MSCs. The spectral results reflected that there were significant increases in the concentration of saturated lipids, proteins, glycogen, and nucleic acids in children and adolescent group BM-MSCs wh…
24618679	Changes in oxidative stress markers and biological markers of muscle injury with aging at rest and in response to an exhaustive exercise.	aging	2014-??-??	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether oxidative stress markers and biomarkers of muscle injury would be affected by aging at rest and in response to an incremental exhaustive exercise.    METHODS: Fifteen young (20.3 ± 2.8 years) and fifteen older adults (65.1 ± 3.5 years) performed an incremental cycle ergometer test to exhaustion. Before and after exercise, oxidative stress [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbic acid, α-Tocopherol, malondialdehyde (MDA)] and muscle injury [creatine kinase (CK), lactate deshydrogenase (LDH)] biomarkers were assessed.    RESULTS: At rest, there was no difference in oxidative stress markers and LDH level between the groups, however CK was significantly higher in the young group than the elderly group (p<0.05). During recovery, in comparison with resting values, a significant increase in SOD (1092 ± 145.9 vs. 1243 ± 98 U/g Hb), GPX (67.4 ± 12.7 vs. 79.2 ± 15.6 U/g Hb) and GR (6.5 ±…
9093009	Comparison between reproducibility and sensitivity of muscle sympathetic nerve traffic and plasma noradrenaline in man.	aging	1997-03-??	1. Although plasma noradrenaline and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic have been shown to be suitable markers of sympathetic activity in man, no study has systematically compared the reproducibility and sensitivity of these two indices of adrenergic tone. 2. Reproducibility data were collected in 10 subjects, in whom plasma noradrenaline was assessed by HPLC on blood samples withdrawn from an antecubital vein and efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity was measured by microneurography from a peroneal nerve, together with arterial blood pressure (Finapres technique). Measurements were obtained in a first session (session 1), 60 min later (session 2) and after 14 days (session 3). While muscle sympathetic nerve activity values recorded in the three different experimental sessions were closely and significantly correlated with each other (r always > 0.90, P < 0.001), noradrenaline showed a less significant correlation between sessions 1 and 2 (r = 0.71, P < 0.05) or no co…
3835415	Changes in oxygen-metabolizing enzymes and lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes as a function of age of donor.	aging	1985-10-14	We have studied the activities of enzymes, which afford protection against superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide and estimated the content of malondialdehyde. Superoxide dismutase activity decreased slightly with advanced age of donors. The activities of catalase and peroxidases were higher in the erythrocytes of the middle age group and the old age group than in the young individuals. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive product was also significantly elevated in the aged donors. These results support the hypothesis that observed differences in the activities of enzymes and the level of malondialdehyde may contribute to the changes associated with aging, produced by the free radical reactions.
3558729	Nyctohemeral growth hormone profiles in young and aged men: correlation with somatomedin-C levels.	aging	1987-05-??	The effects of aging on GH secretion and somatomedin-C (SM-C) levels were studied in 10 young (22-45 yr) and 10 elderly (65-85 yr) men. Plasma GH levels were measured in samples obtained at 20-min intervals for 1300 min. Plasma SM-C levels were measured in samples obtained at 0600, 1100, 1600, 2100, and 0200 h. In the elderly men the mean basal plasma GH level was similar to that in the young men, but the total GH peak area as well as the amplitude of the peaks were significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than those in young men during both the day and the night. Plasma SM-C levels were significantly lower in the elderly men and were correlated with the total integrated GH levels and total GH peak areas, but not with basal plasma GH levels, suggesting that the GH peaks determine SM-C levels and that the decreased GH secretion in elderly men has biological significance.
9284733	Effect of aging on the sensitivity of growth hormone secretion to insulin-like growth factor-I negative feedback.	aging	1997-09-??	To determine the effect of aging on the suppression of GH secretion by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, we studied 11 healthy young adults (6 men, 5 women, mean +/- SD: 25.2 +/- 4.6 yr old; body mass index 23.7 +/- 1.8 kg/m2) and 11 older adults (6 men, 5 women, 69.5 +/- 5.8 yr old; body mass index 24.2 +/- 2.5 kg/m2). Saline (control) or recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) (2 h baseline then, in sequence, 2.5 h each of 1, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg.h) was infused iv during the last 9.5 h of a 40.5-h fast; serum glucose was clamped within 15% of baseline. Baseline serum GH concentrations (mean +/- SE: 3.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L, P = 0.02) and total IGF-I concentrations (219 +/- 15 vs. 103 +/- 19 micrograms/L, P < 0.01) were higher in the younger subjects. In both age groups, GH concentrations were significantly decreased by 3 and 10 micrograms/kg.h, but not by 1 microgram/kg.h rhIGF-I. The absolute decrease in GH concentrations was greater in young than in older subjects du…
17450218	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic evidence of glial effects of cumulative lead exposure in the adult human hippocampus.	aging	2007-04-??	BACKGROUND: Exposure to lead is known to have adverse effects on cognition in several different populations. Little is known about the underlying structural and functional correlates of such exposure in humans.    OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between cumulative exposure to lead and levels of different brain metabolite ratios in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).    METHODS: We performed MRS on 15 men selected from the lowest quintile of patella bone lead within the Department of Veterans Affairs' Normative Aging Study (NAS) and 16 from the highest to assess in the hippocampal levels of the metabolites N-acetylaspartate, myoinositol, and choline, each expressed as a ratio with creatine. Bone lead concentrations-indicators of cumulative lead exposure-were previously measured using K-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. MRS was performed on the men from 2002 to 2004.    RESULTS: A 20-microg/g bone and 15-microg/g bone higher patella and tibia bone lead concentration-…
14568470	fMRI BOLD response to increasing task difficulty during successful paired associates learning.	aging	2003-10-??	We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess cortical activations associated with increasing task difficulty (TD) in a visuospatial paired associates learning task. Encoding and retrieval were examined when 100% successful retrieval of three, four, or six object-location pairs had been attained (thus ensuring that performance was matched across subjects). As memory load increased, in general, the number of attempts taken to achieve 100% successful retrieval increased, while the number of trials correctly completed on the first attempt decreased. By modelling parametric variations in working memory load with BOLD signal changes we were able to identify brain regions displaying linear and nonlinear responses to increasing load. During encoding, load-independent activations were found in occipitoparietal cortices (excluding the precuneus for which linear load dependency was demonstrated), anterior cingulate, and cerebellum, while linear load-dependent activations in thes…
7226250	Unscheduled DNA synthesis in human diploid cells of different donor ages.	lifespan	1981-04-??	Human diploid fibroblast-like cells from two donor of widely different ages were tested for their ability to perform unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) after exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. Cultures were assayed at various times throughout their in vitro lifespans as both confluent and mitotically arrested populations. Cells from both donors maintained their ability to perform UDS throughout their lifespans with arrested populations exhibiting increased levels. The appearance of elevated levels of UDS in arrested cells was directly related to the age of the donor. These results indicate that the loss of ability to repair DNA damage is not a primary cause of in vitro senescence. They do suggest, however, that the regulation of DNA repair synthesis is effected by increasing age.
16227891	Estimated risk score for spine fracture in the specific bending activity of normal Taiwanese men and women.	aging	2005-10-15	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of biologic age, as well as chronologic age, on the vertebral ultimate load (strength) and risk score of vertebral fracture (Phi) between the genders.    SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have shown a good correlation between the biomechanical strength of vertebral bodies and measured bone mineral parameters, whereas other factors also contribute to the bone strength and risk of fractures. Combining multiple factors into a single assessment may provide more comprehensive and individualized estimations of the fracture risk. In this study, we applied the measured bone mineral content (BMC) and bone projection area of the second through the fourth lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4) to assess the biomechanical strength of lumbar vertebrae. In addition, we used the body segment model to estimate the load of the L3 vertebral body during a bending-forward activity, to then estimate the risk score (Phi) of vertebral compression fracture in healthy Chinese…
19017879	Impact of age on pH, 8-isoprostane, and nitrogen oxides in exhaled breath condensate.	aging	2009-02-??	BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed the effects of aging on levels of inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The aim of this study was to determine whether there are significant age-associated differences in pH, 8-isoprostane, and nitrogen oxide values in EBC from a population of healthy adults.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: EBC samples were obtained from 75 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 80 years and stratified into five groups according to age (n = 15): 18 to 29, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 to 80 years. The following were measured in the samples collected: pH before and after deaeration, nitrite, nitrate, and 8-isoprostane. Differences between the groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.    RESULTS: Significant differences in deaerated pH (p < 0.0001) were found in the group of individuals 60 to 80 years of age as compared to the remaining groups. Significant differences were also found in 8-isoprostane levels between the younger and …
16804009	MAP kinases and heat shock-induced hormesis in human fibroblasts during serial passaging in vitro.	longevity, aging	2006-05-??	Adult human skin fibroblasts were exposed repeatedly to 41 degrees C or 42 degrees C heat shock (HS) for 1 h twice a week during serial passaging throughout their replicative life span. On the basis of longevity curves, cell size, and morphology, we observed that repeated mild heat shock (RMHS) at 41, degrees C had strong anti-aging hormetic effects, including 20% extension of cellular longevity. The basal levels of the MAP kinases JNK1, JNK2, and p38 increased during serial passaging, while that of ERK2 decreased. RMHS further exaggerated these effects, which suggests that age-related changes in MAP kinases may be an adaptive response for better cell survival.
9393943	With aging in humans the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system increases and its diurnal amplitude flattens.	aging	1997-??-??	There is compelling evidence for feedback disturbances in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system associated with human aging as assessed by challenge tests. However, reports about age-related changes in human basal activity are ambiguous and to date little is known about changes in the pulsatile features of the HPA system. To investigate these changes we studied twenty-two healthy male and eleven healthy female subjects ranging from 23 to 85 and 24 to 81 years respectively. 24-hour blood sampling with 30 minute sampling intervals was performed. From 18.00 to 24.00 hours blood was sampled every 10 minutes for analysis of pulsatile features of HPA activity. Statistical analysis revealed that age in particular had major effects upon basal HPA-system activity: there was a significant age-associated increase in minimal (p < 0.0001) and mean (p < 0.02) cortisol plasma concentrations, but no alteration in pulsatile features. We found no age-cortisol correlation during daytime, but were abl…
28843509	Walking speed decline in older adults is associated with elevated pro-BDNF in plasma extracellular vesicles.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is produced by cleavage of proBDNF, and BDNF and proBDNF may play antagonistic roles in nervous system development, learning, memory and neuronal stress resistance. BDNF and proBDNF are present in blood, but the origin and relative contributions of soluble and extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated levels are unknown.    METHODS: In this study we used validated immunoassays to measure proBDNF and BDNF levels in plasma, total plasma EVs and a subpopulation of EVs enriched for neuronal origin (expressing the neuronal marker L1CAM) in 150 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants with and without decline in walking speed (reflecting aging-associated motor decline).    RESULTS: Levels of BDNF and proBDNF were highest in L1CAM+ EVs. Participants with walking speed decline had higher levels of proBDNF in L1CAM+ EVs compared to non-decliners, but no differences in proBDNF levels in plasma and total EV.    CONCLUSIONS: Our findings s…
20574128	Three-dimensional observation of decrease in pulp cavity volume using micro-CT: age-related change.	aging	2010-??-??	We investigated three-dimensional decrease in the volume of the pulp chamber caused by age-related secondary dentin formation using micro-CT and evaluated the applicability of the results to evaluation of age taking into account sex, age and tooth type. Decrease was slightly higher in females than in males, and a higher correlation between decrease and aging was observed in females. A comparison between age-groups revealed that decrease progressed between the fifties and sixties in males, and the forties and fifties in females. A stronger correlation between aging and decrease was observed in the mandibular central incisors than in the mandibular second premolars. This correlation was higher than other correlations between sexes and age-groups.
10830176	Age related differences in electroencephalographic and cardiac arousal at the termination of sleep apnea/hypopnea.	aging	2000-05-??	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether electroencephalographic (EEG) and cardiac arousal, i.e. heart rate elevation at the termination of apnea/hypopnea are related to aging.    METHODS: The subjects were 13 middle-aged (40-60 years of age, 47.8+/-5.35 years) and 10 elderly (>60 years of age, 69.8+/-5.31 years) male patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We evaluated the number of apneas per an hour of sleep (apnea index: AI), the number of hypopneas per an hour of sleep (hypopnea index: HI), the summation of HI and AI (apnea/hypopnea index: AHI), sleep stage, the amount of time during which nocturnal oxygen saturation was decreased below 90% (oxygen desaturation time: ODT), and EEG and cardiac arousal at the termination of apnea/hypopnea using polysomnography with pulse oximetry.    RESULTS: There was no significant difference in AHI, duration of apnea/hypopnea, and sleep stage distribution between the two groups. However, the ratio of apnea/hypo…
28760156	Predictors of self-reported health among the elderly in Ghana: a cross sectional study.	aging	2017-??-31	BACKGROUND: Self-reported health is a widely used measure of health status across individuals. As the ageing population increases, the health of the elderly also becomes of growing concern. The elderly go through life facing social, economic and financial hardships. These hardships are known to affect the health status of people as they age. The purpose of this study is to assess social and health related factors of self-reported health among the elderly in Ghana.    METHODS: A multivariate regression analysis in form of a binary and ordinal logistic regression were used to determine the association between socioeconomic, demographic and health related factors, on self-reported health. The data used for this study was drawn from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 1.    RESULTS: In total, out of 2613 respondent, 579 (20.1%) rated their health status as poor and 2034 (79.9%) as good. The results showed that the odds of reporting poor h…
8250312	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rocuronium (Org 9426) in elderly surgical patients.	aging	1993-12-??	The effects of age on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to rocuronium (Org 9426) were studied in 20 elderly (> 70 yr) and 20 younger control patients (< 60 yr) during N2O/O2, fentanyl anesthesia. The onset times were the same for both the elderly and younger control group, but the duration of action of rocuronium was significantly prolonged in the elderly patients. Elderly patients, when compared with the younger, also exhibited a significant decrease in plasma clearance (3.67 +/- 1.0 vs 5.03 +/- 1.5 mL.kg-1.min-1, mean +/- SD) and volume of distribution (399 +/- 122 vs 553 +/- 279 mL/kg, mean +/- SD). During the recovery phase of paralysis, no significant difference was seen in the log plasma concentration versus twitch tension response relationship between 20% and 80% paralysis in young and elderly patients receiving rocuronium. The differences in action of rocuronium between the elderly and younger groups can be fully explained by the observed differences in the dist…
28599217	Reduced dopamine receptors and transporters but not synthesis capacity in normal aging adults: a meta-analysis.	aging	2017-??-??	Many theories of cognitive aging are based on evidence that dopamine (DA) declines with age. Here, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of cross-sectional positron emission tomography and single-photon emission-computed tomography studies on the average effects of age on distinct DA targets (receptors, transporters, or relevant enzymes) in healthy adults (N = 95 studies including 2611 participants). Results revealed significant moderate to large, negative effects of age on DA transporters and receptors. Age had a significantly larger effect on D1- than D2-like receptors. In contrast, there was no significant effect of age on DA synthesis capacity. The average age reductions across the DA system were 3.7%-14.0% per decade. A meta-regression found only DA target as a significant moderator of the age effect. This study precisely quantifies prior claims of reduced DA functionality with age. It also identifies presynaptic mechanisms (spared synthesis capacity and reduced DA transporters)…
21616984	The effects of aging on material-independent and material-dependent neural correlates of source memory retrieval.	aging	2012-01-??	Age-related declines in source memory have been observed for various stimuli and associated details. These impairments may be related to alterations in brain regions contributing to source memory via material-independent processes and/or regions specialized for processing specific materials. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigate the effects of aging on source memory and associated neural activity for words and objects. Source accuracy was equally impaired in older adults for both materials. Imaging data revealed both groups recruited similar networks of regions to support source memory accuracy irrespective of material, including parietal and prefrontal cortices (PFC) and the hippocampus. Age-related decreases in material-independent activity linked to postretrieval monitoring were observed in right lateral PFC. Additionally, age-related increases in source accuracy effects were shown in perirhinal cortex, which were positively correlated with perfor…
14610395	Relationship of bone and blood lead levels to psychiatric symptoms: the normative aging study.	aging	2003-11-??	Blood and bone lead levels were used to investigate lead's potential effect on psychiatric symptoms among middle-aged to elderly men from the Normative Aging Study. Symptoms were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and analyzed as individual outcomes as well as a measure that combined anxiety, depression, and phobic anxiety. Blood and bone lead averaged 6.3 microg/dL (standard deviation [SD] = 4.16), 21.9 microg/g (SD = 13.5), and 32.1 microg/g (SD = 19.8) for blood, tibia, and patella lead, respectively. In logistic regression models that adjusted for age, alcohol intake, employment status, and education status, we found that patella bone lead was significantly associated with an increased risk of phobic anxiety and the combined outcome measure at the P </= 0.05 level. Tibia and blood lead had similar associations. We conclude that cumulative lead exposure, which bone lead levels reflect, could be a risk factor for psychiatric symptoms even at modest levels of exposure.
10662744	Effects of methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and oxidative status in healthy adults.	aging	2000-02-08	BACKGROUND: Homocysteine-mediated endothelial dysfunction has been proposed to occur via oxidative stress mechanisms in humans. However, there is controversy regarding the effects of homocysteine on endothelial function and oxidative status, which may in part result from age discrepancy across the studies. The present study was designed to investigate the aging effect on the relationship between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and oxidative status in methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH), P-selectin levels, and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation were measured at baseline and 4 hours after an oral methionine load (0.1 g/kg) in 15 younger (21 to 40 years) and 15 older (55 to 70 years) healthy adults. Homocysteine increased from 7.3+/-1.3 micromol/L at baseline to 22.7+/-5.2 micromol/L at 4 hours in younger (P<0.001) and from 7. 4+/-1.4 to 24.3+/-4.5 micromol/L in older adults (P<0.001). P…
15953711	Age-related reorganization of encoding networks directly influences subsequent recognition memory.	aging	2005-09-??	Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to link performance-related brain activity during two word encoding tasks to subsequent recognition for those words in young and older adults. There were no significant group differences in performance during encoding, but the young subjects performed better than the older at the recognition task. Performance-related brain networks strongly differed between the two groups. In young subjects, there were two networks associated with performance, one related to encoding (mainly involving premotor and parietal brain regions) and the other to recognition (involving middle frontal, and lateral and medial temporal regions), whereas the network for older subjects (including prefrontal, premotor, lateral and medial temporal regions) was associated both with encoding and recognition. Areas in this network strongly overlapped with those supporting recognition in the young subjects (e.g., medial temporal lobe), suggesting that older subjects may have …
15111615	Topographic and age-dependent expression of heme oxygenase-1 and catalase in the human retinal pigment epithelium.	aging	2004-05-??	PURPOSE: To investigate the hypothesis that there are topographic and age-related changes in the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and catalase in the RPE.    METHODS: Cryosections of the macula and periphery of human eyes (n = 18; aged 27-87 years) were subjected to a high-sensitivity digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA in situ hybridization protocol to determine the expression of HO-1 and catalase. The immunoreactivity of HO-1 and catalase were also investigated in the same sample set. Specimens were examined by light microscopy, and images were captured with a digital camera. The total number of RPE cells and HO-1- and catalase-labeled RPE cells was counted in each section, and the ratio of labeled RPE cells to total RPE cells was calculated in both the macular and the peripheral regions of each donor eye.    RESULTS: There was a mosaic pattern of mRNA and protein expression of HO-1 and catalase in macular and peripheral RPE. Topographical differences in the expression of HO-1 at the m…
24274704	Vitamin D-responsive SGPP2 variants associated with lung cell expression and lung function.	aging	2013-11-25	BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is associated with lung health in epidemiologic studies, but mechanisms mediating observed associations are poorly understood. This study explores mechanisms for an effect of vitamin D in lung through an in vivo gene expression study, an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in lung tissue, and a population-based cohort study of sequence variants.    METHODS: Microarray analysis investigated the association of gene expression in small airway epithelial cells with serum 25(OH)D in adult non-smokers. Sequence variants in candidate genes identified by the microarray were investigated in a lung tissue eQTL database, and also in relation to cross-sectional pulmonary function in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, stratified by race, with replication in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).    RESULTS: 13 candidate genes had significant differences in expression by serum 25(OH)D (nominal p < 0.05), and a genome-wide significant eQTL asso…
2914154	Circadian rhythms of melatonin and cortisol in aging.	aging	1989-02-01	The relationship of age to the circadian rhythms of melatonin and cortisol was investigated in 44 men and 27 women (age range 19-89 years). Subjects were physically and psychiatrically normal. Four hourly serial blood samples were drawn from 8:00 AM until 8:00 AM the next day, with additional samples at 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM. The indoor illumination was restricted to 300 lux during day and 50 lux during the night. Plasma melatonin and cortisol were estimated by radioimmunoassay. Results show that the means of melatonin and cortisol values decreased significantly with age when the subjects were divided into three age groups, i.e., 19-25 years, 42-65 years, and 66-89 years. They also showed a significant negative correlation with age. The acrophases of the two hormonal rhythms, however, showed different relationships to age. The acrophase of melatonin rhythm showed a positive correlation with age (r = 0.38, p less than 0.001), and cortisol showed a negative correlation with age (r = -0.56…
23433787	Activation profile of CXCL8-stimulated neutrophils and aging.	aging	2013-03-??	Neutrophils are pivotal effector cells of innate immunity representing the first line of defense against aggression. They are the first cells to arrive at the site of the aggression, where they can directly eliminate the invading microorganisms. Their activation and recruitment into peripheral tissues is indispensable for host defense. With aging, there are alterations of the receptor by driven functions of human neutrophils as a decrease in the functional changes in signaling elicited by specific receptors, as CXCR1. We investigated the activation of neutrophils from elderly after the cells were cultivated with CXCL8. Although, CXCL8 induced elastase (ELA) secretion, data showed neither myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity nor production of IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF by neutrophils from elderly compared with young individuals. On the other hand, in the presence of only LPS or LPS associated with CXCL8 neutrophils from elderly individuals, there were significant levels of IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF but no…
25446984	Metals in plasma of nonagenarians and centenarians living in a key area of longevity.	longevity, aging	2014-12-??	The concentration of calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se) in plasma of 76 nonagenarians (mean age, 89.0±6.3 years), 64 centenarians (mean age, 101±1 years) and 24 middle-aged subjects as controls (mean age 61.2±1.1 years), was determined by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. All the subjects lived in Sardinia, an Italian island, that has the higher prevalence of centenarians than in other European countries. A comparison among the three classes of age showed a significant depletion of Ca, Co, Fe, Mn and Se (all p<0.001) in nonagenarians and centenarians with respect to controls. In particular, the geometric mean (GM) values of Ca, Co, Fe, Mn and Se were: 94.1 μg/ml, 0.46 ng/ml, 1314 ng/ml, 2.47 ng/ml and 111 ng/ml in controls; 87.6 μg/ml, 0.22 ng/ml, 815 ng/ml, 1.07 ng/ml and 88.9 ng/ml in nonagenarians; 87.0 μg/ml, 0.29 ng/ml, 713 ng/ml, 1.27 ng/ml and 81.9 ng/ml in centenarians. The highest inverse…
1414224	Aging and spectral analysis of EEG in normal subjects: a link to memory and CSF AChE.	aging	1992-08-??	We studied the effect of aging on EEG spectra recorded from T5-O1 (T6-O2) derivation. The aging series composed of 52 normal individuals aged 20 to 91 years. Seventy-nine per cent of visual and 81% of quantitative EEGs were considered normal. The absolute amplitude of delta and theta bands and absolute power of delta band were lower for the oldest group (aged 60 and over) than for the youngest group (aged 20-39 years). Age was inversely related to the amount of delta and theta indicating that the amount of slow activity in quantitative EEG does not increase with age in the context of good health status. Women had more beta activity compared with men. In addition, the amount of beta and alpha bands showed tendency for a reduction with age. Fifteen subjects aged 50 years or older participated in a 2-year follow-up including EEG and neuropsychological evaluation. Seven of them deteriorated in learning ability and showed increase in delta activity. In the oldest age group, delta amplitude …
21452937	Face processing changes in normal aging revealed by fMRI adaptation.	aging	2011-11-??	We investigated the neural correlates of facial processing changes in healthy aging using fMRI and an adaptation paradigm. In the scanner, participants were successively presented with faces that varied in identity, viewpoint, both, or neither and performed a head size detection task independent of identity or viewpoint. In right fusiform face area (FFA), older adults failed to show adaptation to the same face repeatedly presented in the same view, which elicited the most adaptation in young adults. We also performed a multivariate analysis to examine correlations between whole-brain activation patterns and behavioral performance in a face-matching task tested outside the scanner. Despite poor neural adaptation in right FFA, high-performing older adults engaged the same face-processing network as high-performing young adults across conditions, except the one presenting a same facial identity across different viewpoints. Low-performing older adults used this network to a lesser extent. …
16778698	Discordantly high spinal bone mineral density values in patients with adult lumbar scoliosis.	aging	2006-06-15	STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.    OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were: 1) to investigate the validity of bone mineral density measurements with DEXA in patients with adult lumbar scoliosis and 2) to investigate the association between osteoporosis and adult lumbar scoliosis.    SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporosis and lumbar degenerative scoliosis are phenomena encountered with increased frequency in aging, often concurrently. It has been suggested that scoliosis predisposes to osteoporosis, but degenerative scoliosis could falsely elevate spinal bone mineral density measurements.    METHODS: The feasibility of measuring Cobb's angle in DEXA scans was established in 48 surgical candidates with standing anteroposterior lumbar radiographs and supine DEXA scans. Charts and radiographs of 454 consecutive adult patients evaluated at an osteoporosis center were reviewed thereafter. The association between age, lumbar curve, and various bone density measurements was investigate…
9890438	Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule expression in the dentate gyrus of the human hippocampal formation from infancy to old age.	lifespan	1999-01-01	Modulation of neural cell adhesion molecule polysialylation (NCAM PSA) state has been proposed to underlie morphofunctional change associated with consolidation of memory in the rodent, and its age-dependent decline to be related to impaired cognitive function. To establish whether this may be a human correlate of cognitive decline, we determined the age-dependent expression of PSA in the human hippocampal dentate gyrus using postmortem tissue derived from individuals who exhibited no obvious neuropathology. As in the rodent, PSA immunoreactivity in the 5-month human infant was associated mainly with a population of granule-like cells and their mossy fibre axons. Cell numbers were maximal during the first 3 years of life but declined by an order of magnitude between the second and third decades and remained relatively constant thereafter and was restricted to the granule cell layer/hilar border. In contrast to the rodent, diffuse immunostaining was observed in the inner molecular layer…
20399796	Increased neural activation during picture encoding and retrieval in 60-year-olds compared to 20-year-olds.	aging	2010-06-??	Brain aging has been associated with both reduced and increased neural activity during task execution. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether increased neural activation during memory encoding and retrieval is already present at the age of 60 as well as to obtain more insight into the mechanism behind increased activity. Eighteen young (mean age 21.3) and 18 older (mean age 59.9) right-handed male participants were administered two picture memory tasks in an fMRI environment. Neural activation was measured during encoding and retrieval of pictures of natural scenes (landscapes) and physical objects. Results indicated reduced medial temporal activity during encoding in older participants and increased activity during both encoding and retrieval in several other areas in the brain, including the inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. This increased activation was not related to better memory performance. The present findings indicate that increased neural act…
6585833	Nondisulfide polymerization of gamma- and beta-crystallins in the human lens.	aging	1984-05-??	The water-soluble 43,000-dalton fraction (WS43) of the human lens has been shown to be heterogeneous. It appears to contain, in addition to actin, components related to the crystallins. Immunoblot reactions indicate that this polypeptide fraction is composed of dimers containing beta- and gamma-crystallin components. It has been estimated that 10-30% of this fraction arises by dimerization of gamma-crystallin. A possible route for the formation of the 43,000-dalton fraction is suggested by the observation that photolysis of gamma-crystallin with light greater than 295 nm leads to polymer formation, including the 43,000-dalton fraction. The polymerization products react with anti-WS43. The results suggest that photochemical reactions may lead to the accumulation of polymers of some of the crystallins with aging of the human lens. Similar covalently linked polypeptides have previously been shown to be present in the high molecular weight aggregates associated with cataract formation.
6548258	Effect of age on poly- and monoglutamyl folacin absorption in human subjects.	aging	1984-10-??	Intestinal folacin absorption and mucosal conjugase activities were assessed in healthy male elderly (65-83 years) and young (20-29 years) human subjects. Luminal disappearance as measured simultaneously from the perfused jejunum of 3 mumol of both [3H]pteroylmonoglutamate [( 3H]PG-1) and pteroyl-[14C]glutamyl-hexaglutamate [( 14C]PG-7) as well as the urinary recovery of each isotope and mucosal conjugase activities were compared. Luminal disappearance of either [3H]PG-1 or [14C]PG-7 was not different for the two age groups (P greater than 0.05). The average (mean +/- SD) disappearance of [3H]PG-1 was 63 +/- 12% in the elderly and 67 +/- 6% in the young groups. In contrast, the disappearance of [14C]PG-7 averaged 51 +/- 6% in the elderly and 48 +/- 3% in the young group. Urinary recovery (percent in 48 hours) was not different for either isotope when the two age groups were compared (P greater than 0.05). The urinary recovery of 3H averaged 60 +/- 21% in the elderly and 59 +/- 13% in t…
9677431	The case for adaptability of the neuromuscular junction to endurance exercise training.	aging	1998-08-??	Although the adaptability of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has been demonstrated using the models of denervation/reinnervation, electrical stimulation, development, aging, and pathological states, relatively little is known about the effects of increased chronic voluntary use on the morphology and physiological function of the NMJ. A review of findings relating to adaptations in the various pre- and postsynaptic components of the NMJ with exercise training is presented. These findings are discussed as they pertain to NMJ function during exercise. Other physiological modulators of the NMJ, such as trophic factors released by nerve terminals and muscles, and circulating substances are discussed in terms of possible roles they may play in training-induced adaptations.
3784628	Induction of heat shock proteins in young and senescent human diploid fibroblasts.	lifespan	1986-10-??	When human diploid fibroblasts, TIG-1, reached the end of their proliferative lifespan in vitro, they still could synthesize proteins with molecular weight of about 70,000, 85,000 and 116,000 following the heat shock at 46 degrees C for 10 min as well as young cells did so.
18022337	Effect of zinc on cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity.	aging	2008-05-??	Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a posttranslational protein modification, which is catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and plays a role in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability. A decrease in cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been implicated in the aging process. As PARP-1 is a zinc finger protein its decreased function might be related to age-related zinc deficiency. To test this hypothesis we assessed cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity in 29 donors from Greece, Italy and Poland as function of age and nutritional zinc status. Our results reveal a positive correlation between cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity and zinc status in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (p<0.05). We could also confirm a decrease of PARP-1 activity with donor age, highlighting the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the aging process. The results demonstrate that zinc supplementation in elderly people can increase the cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity of thei…
22433609	Compensatory brain activity during encoding among older adults with better recognition memory for face-name pairs: an integrative functional, structural, and perfusion imaging study.	aging	2012-05-??	Many neuroimaging studies interpret the commonly reported findings of age-related increases in frontal response and/or increased bilateral activation as suggestive of compensatory neural recruitment. However, it is often unclear whether differences are due to compensation or reflective of other cognitive or physiological processes. This study aimed to determine whether there are compensatory age-related changes in brain systems supporting successful associative encoding while taking into account potentially confounding factors including age-related differences in task performance, atrophy, and resting perfusion. Brain response during encoding of face-name pairs was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 10 older and nine young adults and was correlated with memory performance. During successful encoding, older adults demonstrated increased frontal and decreased occipital activity as well as greater bilateral involvement relative to the young. Findings remained signific…
12084447	Gender differences in cerebral glucose metabolism: a PET study.	aging	2002-07-15	OBJECTIVE: Some studies have examined gender differences in brain function based on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism by using positron emission tomography (PET). However, the findings of these studies are controversial and most of them were analyzed by the regions of interest (ROIs) method. Here, we evaluated gender differences of cerebral glucose metabolism under the resting state in a voxel-based analysis.    METHODS: We studied 44 healthy volunteers (22 females, 63.0+/-6.3 years, and 22 males, 63.1+/-8.4 years). Cerebral glucose metabolic images were obtained with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. All individual data were transformed to standard brain space and the male and female groups were compared using statistical parametric mapping (SPM).    RESULTS: The males had significantly higher glucose metabolism in the right insula, middle temporal gyrus, and medial frontal lobe than the females. Glucose metabolism in the hypothalamus was significantly higher in female…
24853269	Adult age differences in frontostriatal representation of prediction error but not reward outcome.	aging	2014-06-??	Emerging evidence from decision neuroscience suggests that although younger and older adults show similar frontostriatal representations of reward magnitude, older adults often show deficits in feedback-driven reinforcement learning. In the present study, healthy adults completed reward-based tasks that did or did not depend on probabilistic learning, while undergoing functional neuroimaging. We observed reductions in the frontostriatal representation of prediction errors during probabilistic learning in older adults. In contrast, we found evidence for stability across adulthood in the representation of reward outcome in a task that did not require learning. Together, the results identify changes across adulthood in the dynamic coding of relational representations of feedback, in spite of preserved reward sensitivity in old age. Overall, the results suggest that the neural representation of prediction error, but not reward outcome, is reduced in old age. These findings reveal a potenti…
17884341	Reduction of DNA damage in older healthy adults by Tri E Tocotrienol supplementation.	aging	2008-01-??	OBJECTIVE: The free radical theory of aging (FRTA) suggests that free radicals are the leading cause of deteriorating physiologic function during senescence. Free radicals attack cellular structures or molecules such as DNA resulting in various modifications to the DNA structures. Accumulation of unrepaired DNA contributes to a variety of disorders associated with the aging process.    METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of Tri E Tocotrienol on DNA damage. Sixty four subjects 37-78 y old completed the study. A daily dose of 160 mg of Tri E Tocotrienol was given for 6 months. Blood samples were analyzed for DNA damage using comet assay, frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), and chromosome 4 aberrations.    RESULTS: Results showed a significant reduction in DNA damage as measured by comet assay after 3 mo (P < 0.01) and remained low at 6 mo (P < 0.01). The frequency of SCE was also reduced after 6 mo of supplementat…
21621558	Novel claustrum activation observed during a visuomotor adaptation task using a viewing window paradigm.	aging	2011-10-01	Previous literature has reported a wide range of anatomical correlates when participants are required to perform a visuomotor adaptation task. However, traditional adaptation tasks suffer a number of inherent limitations that may, in part, give rise to this variability. For instance, the sparse visual environment does not map well onto conditions in which a visuomotor transformation would normally be required in everyday life. To further clarify these neural underpinnings, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed on 17 (6M, age range 20-45 years old; mean age=26) naive participants performing a viewing window task in which a visuomotor transformation was created by varying the relationship between the participant's movement and the resultant movement of the viewing window. The viewing window task more naturally replicates scenarios in which haptic and visual information would be combined to achieve a higher-level goal. Even though activity related to visuomotor adapta…
15677407	Effects of self-esteem on age-related changes in cognition and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	aging	2004-12-??	Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the effects of self-esteem on global health and life expectancy in normal aging. Endocrinological studies in humans have demonstrated the effects of self-esteem on basal regulation and reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. To investigate the effects of differences in self-esteem on age-related changes in cognitive performance and HPA regulation, we investigated 20 healthy elderly subjects (age range 60-84, mean age 69.8 y). We assessed salivary cortisol levels together with neuropsychological assessment, and psychological assessment for self-esteem and locus of control. Across the study sample, age was significantly associated with reductions in cognitive performance and changes in basal cortisol regulation. Self-esteem appeared independent of age. Defining two groups of subjects with high and low self-esteem, age-related changes in cognitive and endocrinological variables became more prominent in the low self-esteem grou…
6371116	The physiological significance of the glucose intolerance of aging.	aging	1984-05-??	Aging is associated with glucose intolerance, but its significance is unclear. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests and more physiologic meal tolerance tests in a group of 23 young adults, mean (+/- SE) age, 37 +/- 2 years and 17 elderly adults, mean age 69 +/- 1 years. The total glucose and insulin responses following the oral glucose load were increased by 24% and 127% respectively in the elderly compared with the young (24,524 +/- 1,080 vs. 19,734 +/- 702 mg/dl X min and 24,289 +/- 3,401 vs. 10,700 +/- 1,209 microU/ml X min). Following mixed meals, the total glucose response was 45,795 +/- 1,343 mg/dl X min in the young, compared with 50,998 +/- 1,850 mg/dl X min in the elderly (p less than .05) an 11% increase. Total insulin response was increased by 40% in the elderly (38,590 +/- 3,662 microU/ml X min) compared with the young (27,481 +/- 2,805 microU/ml X min) (p less than .05). We conclude that following the ingestion of more physiologic mixed meals, modest postprandial hype…
8829425	Suicide and aging. II: The psychobiological interface.	aging	1995-??-??	There is an accumulating body of research suggesting that suicidal behavior may be associated with abnormalities of the central serotonin system. Other monoaminergic, peptidergic, and neuroendocrine systems have been implicated as well. A review of studies that examine neurobiological variables in postmortem tissue of suicide victims and controls reveals that investigators in most instances have viewed age as a confound to be controlled rather than considering it as a variable of interest. However, the close associations between aging and increased suicide rates, and the knowledge that the functional integrity of many of these same systems changes with normal and abnormal aging processes, raise the possibility that biological aging contributes to suicide risk, and that the underlying neurobiology of suicide in the elderly differs from that of younger people. The few available studies that did examine the association of age with neurobiological measures indicate directions for future re…
22239660	Activity of mannose-binding lectin in centenarians.	longevity	2012-06-??	We analyzed MBL2 gene variants in two cohorts of centenarians, octo-nonagenarians and nonagenarians, and in the general population, one from Sardinia Island (Italy), recruited in the frame of the AKea study, and another from Campania (southern Italy), to search for haplotypes related to longevity. We also assessed in vitro the effect of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) on various human cells at different stage of senescence. The frequency of high and null activity haplotypes was significantly lower, and the frequency of intermediate activity haplotype significantly higher in centenarians and in subjects between 80 and 99 years from both the cohorts as compared each to the general population from the same geographic area. Furthermore, serum MBL concentration (also after normalization to serum albumin) was significantly lower in centenarians and in octo- and nonagenarians as compared to the general population, suggesting that intermediate MBL haplotype/activity may be protective. We also dem…
21571262	Effect of age on surface molecules and cytokine expression in human dendritic cells.	aging	2011-??-??	Dendritic cells (DCs) are central in regulating both innate and acquired immunity, but their possible age-related functional modifications are still unclear. Here we have analyzed the effect of age on LPS-treated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). A negative correlation between age and cell expression of ICAM-1, CD25 and IL-10 was observed in a group of healthy donors. This has been confirmed by a significantly reduced expression of the same molecules in cells of subgrouped elderly versus younger individuals. On the contrary, a positive correlation between age and cell expression of IL-6 and IL-18 has been reported in all the subjects and further supported by a significant increase of the two pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells of elderly versus young subjects. Our data indicate that aging can impair the expression of ICAM-1 and CD25 and skew the production of cytokines, including IL-18, which concur to make a pro-inflammatory milieu. Altogether, the present results point to additional mole…
10501781	Total body and regional bone mineral density in men: effect of age.	aging	1999-??-??	Bone density is related to the risk of fracture, with a decrease in bone density resulting in an increased risk of fracture. The aims of this study were to characterize the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and age at different skeletal sites in men, and to determine whether the BMD pattern with age reflects the pattern of fracture in men. We studied 178 healthy Caucasian men, ages 20-79 years (approximately 30 per decade) from a general practitioner register. Spinal radiographs were obtained from men over 50 years of age and graded by a radiologist for spinal osteoarthritis by the method of Kellgren. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the anteroposterior (AP) lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanter, ultradistal forearm and total body (providing estimates for the pelvis, head, arms, legs, trunk, ribs and spine). Severe osteoarthritis (grades 3 and 4) was associated with increased spine BMD, and therefore individuals with severe osteoar…
28251397	Effect of lifelong football training on the expression of muscle molecular markers involved in healthy longevity.	longevity	2017-04-??	PURPOSE: We investigated whether lifelong football training affects the expression of healthy longevity-related muscle molecular markers.    METHODS: Biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis muscle of 10 lifelong football-trained men (68.2 ± 3.0 years) and of 10 active untrained healthy men (66.7 ± 1.3 years). Gene and protein expression was measured by RTqPCR on RNA and by western blotting on protein extracts from muscle biopsies, respectively.    RESULTS: The expression of AMPKα1/α2, NAMPT, TFAM and PGC1α, which are markers of oxidative metabolism, and MyHC β isoform expression was higher in the muscle of football-trained men vs untrained men. Also citrate synthase activity was higher in trained than in untrained men (109.3 ± 9.2 vs 75.1 ± 9.2 mU/mg). These findings were associated with a healthier body composition in trained than in untrained men [body weight: 78.2 ± 6.5 vs 91.2 ± 11.2 kg; body mass index BMI: 24.4 ± 1.6 vs 28.8 ± 4.0 kg m; fat%: 22.6 ± 8.0 vs 31.4 ± 5.0%)]…
8538241	Human lymphocytes incubated in vitro share multiple characteristics with geriatric-derived lymphocytes: a potential in vitro model for aging?	aging	1995-08-08	Aging involves a complicated set of parallel reactions that result in multiple cellular and organismic changes and may eventuate in chronic illness. In the immune system, several alterations that correlate with age have been established. In the present study, we report the results of incubating lymphocytes in vitro in whole blood and, employing measures known to be age-dependent, compare these cells 'aged' in vitro with cells from geriatric patients aged in vivo. Cells from blood aged in vivo and incubated in vitro share a number of common characteristics that include decreased growth capacity, shifted growth patterns, increased suppression by adherent cells, decrease in CD5 surface antigen, similar responses to addition of exogenous IL-1, IL-2, PGE2, or indomethacin, and similar production of PGE2. Differences found between in vivo aging and in vitro incubation are IL-2 plasma levels and IL-2 production by activated cells monitored in conditioned minimal medium. Based on these observa…
22244945	Epidemiologic characteristics of intraocular pressure in the Korean and Mongolian populations: the Healthy Twin and the GENDISCAN study.	aging	2012-03-??	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a negative association between intraocular pressure (IOP) and age in 2 Asian populations. In addition, we evaluated genetic and nongenetic factors associated with IOP.    DESIGN: Family-based cohort study.    PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects >10 years of age from one Korean (The Healthy Twin; n = 1431) and 2 Mongolian populations (The GENDISCAN; n = 859 and 806) with IOP values.    METHODS: The IOP values were measured with a noncontact tonometer. Each participant received a standard health examination and received questionnaires, which include candidate risk factors on IOP. Mixed models were used to identify risk factors for IOP. Variance-component methods were applied to estimate the heritability of IOP.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The negative trend of IOP with aging and evaluation of impact of genetic and nongenetic components on IOP.    RESULTS: The mean ages were 43.6, 34.1, and 36.3 years for the Korean, Orhontuul, and Dashbalbar p…
18331267	Assessment of sexual health in aging men in Europe: development and validation of the European Male Ageing Study sexual function questionnaire.	aging	2008-06-??	INTRODUCTION: Assessment of male sexual dysfunction has been the focus of substantial scientific effort. Less research has focused on the development of instruments for the measurement of sexual functioning in aging men.    AIMS: The aims of this study were: (i) to characterize the psychometric properties of a new brief, reliable, and valid measure of male sexual functioning for use in a large population survey of middle-aged and elderly European men; and (ii) specifically, to determine whether the new instrument, the European Male Ageing Study-sexual function questionnaire (EMAS-SFQ), discriminates between men with high and low levels of circulating testosterone (T) (total T, free T, and bioavailable T).    METHOD: One thousand six hundred men aged 40-79 years completed the self-administered EMAS-SFQ, the Beck depression inventory, and provided a blood sample for assessment of sex hormones. Eighty-five men aged 35-74 years completed the EMAS-SFQ twice, 2 weeks apart to examine the tes…
2220258	Pyridostigmine partially restores the GH responsiveness to GHRH in normal aging.	aging	1990-08-??	In 11 elderly normal subjects and in 17 young healthy subjects we studied the response of plasma growth hormone to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH(29), 1 microgram/kg iv) alone and preceded by pyridostigmine (120 mg orally 60 min before GHRH), a cholinesterase inhibitor likely able to suppress somatostatin release. The GH response to pyridostigmine alone was also examined. Basal plasma GH levels were similar in elderly and young subjects. In the elderly, GHRH induced a GH rise (AUC, median and range: 207.5, 43.5-444.0 micrograms.l-1.h-1) which was lower (p = 0.006) than that observed in young subjects (548.0, 112.5-2313.5 micrograms.l-1.h-1). The pyridostigmine-induced GH rise in the elderly was similar to that in young subjects (300.5, 163.0-470.0 vs 265.0, 33.0-514.5 micrograms.l-1.h-1). Pyridostigmine potentiated the GH responsiveness to GHRH in both elderly (437.5, 152.0-1815.5 micrograms.l-1.h-1; p = 0.01 vs GHRH alone) and young subjects (2140.0, 681.5-4429.5 micrograms.l-1.h-1; p = 0…
19320550	Span, CRUNCH, and beyond: working memory capacity and the aging brain.	aging	2010-04-??	Neuroimaging data emphasize that older adults often show greater extent of brain activation than younger adults for similar objective levels of difficulty. A possible interpretation of this finding is that older adults need to recruit neuronal resources at lower loads than younger adults, leaving no resources for higher loads, and thus leading to performance decrements [Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis; e.g., Reuter-Lorenz, P. A., & Cappell, K. A. Neurocognitive aging and the compensation hypothesis. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, 177-182, 2008]. The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis leads to the prediction that activation differences between younger and older adults should disappear when task difficulty is made subjectively comparable. In a Sternberg memory search task, this can be achieved by assessing brain activity as a function of load relative to the individual's memory span, which declines with age. Spe…
8536064	Age modulates effects of thyroid dysfunction on sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels.	aging	1995-??-??	Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are difficult to detect in elderly people and TSH is sometimes unreliable. We therefore tested the value of SHBG as a marker of thyroid hormone action on the liver to determine the thyroid status of elderly people. Aging euthyroid men and women have a significant increase in SHBG (p > 0.0001). In aging women the decrease in SHBG with hypothyroidism and increase with hyperthyroidism are highly significant (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0005 respectively). No significant variation in SHBG was observed in men with thyroid dysfunction. SHBG can help to determine the thyroid status of aging women.
1400863	Long-term longitudinal measurements of plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in normal men.	aging	1992-10-??	Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DS) was measured by direct tritium RIA in longitudinal plasma specimens from 97 normal healthy male participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Fasting blood was collected at regular visits (approximately 1.5 yr apart) over an average 13 yr of adulthood (cumulative age range: 32-83 yr). DS was measured in 3-4 widely spaced specimens from each subject. A decline in DS was found in 65 (67%) subjects, 13 subjects (13%) showed no change, and increases were found in the 19 remaining subjects during the study period. A plot of individual data points revealed the same pattern we had obtained previously from a cross-sectional study of a different normal male population. A plot of DS values vs. age among subjects whose DS increased during the study also revealed an age-related decline. Thus, the longitudinal decrease in circulating DS, long inferred from cross-sectional data, is confirmed for normal men in the present study. A more detailed study o…
27159187	The interplay of subjective social status and essentialist beliefs about cognitive aging on cortisol reactivity to challenge in older adults.	aging	2016-??-??	Older adults are more likely than younger adults to experience stress when confronted with cognitive challenges. However, little is known about individual differences that might explain why some older adults exhibit stronger stress responses than others. We examined the interplay of two social-cognitive factors to explain older adults' cortisol reactivity: (1) subjective social status, and (2) essentialist beliefs about cognitive aging. We hypothesized that, depending on whether older adults believe that aging-related cognitive decline is inevitable versus modifiable, low subjective social status should lead to stronger or weaker cortisol reactivity. Using longitudinal data, we assessed the impact of cognitive challenges on stress reactivity in a sample of older adults (N = 389; 61-86 years). As predicted, regression analyses confirmed that 44 min after cognitively challenging tasks, older adults exhibited a significantly different cortisol reactivity depending on their subjective soci…
10904463	The relationship between longitudinal declines in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations and cognitive performance in older men.	aging	2000-07-24	BACKGROUND: The observation that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations decrease markedly with age has led to the hypothesis that declining DHEA concentrations may contribute to age-related changes in cognition. In the United States, DHEA is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement that individuals are using in an effort to ameliorate age-related cognitive and physical changes.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between age-associated decreases in endogenous DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) concentrations and declines in neuropsychological performance in a prospective, longitudinal study.    METHODS: The subjects were 883 men from a community-dwelling volunteer sample in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The men were aged 22 to 91 years at the initial visit, and they were followed up for as long as 31 years (mean, 11. 55 years), with biennial reassessments of multiple cognitive domains and contemporaneous measurement of serum DHEA-S concentrations. Outcome meas…
2240631	Nitrous oxide and epinephrine-induced arrhythmias.	aging	1990-12-??	We asked whether the sympathomimetic effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) predisposed patients receiving N2O to arrhythmias in response to epinephrine administration. We also asked whether aging contributed to the development of arrhythmias, with or without N2O. One hundred patients having transsphenoidal hypophysectomy were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia including (n = 49) or excluding (n = 51) N2O. All patients were given an injection of epinephrine 1:200,000, with 0.5% lidocaine to produce hemostasis. Using intermittent 12-lead and continuous lead II electrocardiography, we determined the incidence of premature ventricular contraction, isorhythmic atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, and changes in T-wave morphology. Patients given N2O had a significantly higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation (61.2% vs 41.2%). A trend toward a higher incidence of multiple premature ventricular contractions (16.3% vs 7.8%) was not statistically significant. Both anesthetic groups had a hig…
20566580	Neuroanatomical prerequisites for language functions in the maturing brain.	aging	2011-02-??	The 2 major language-relevant cortical regions in the human brain, Broca's area and Wernicke's area, are connected via the fibers of the arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus (AF/SLF). Here, we compared this pathway in adults and children and its relation to language processing during development. Comparison of fiber properties demonstrated lower anisotropy in children's AF/SLF, arguing for an immature status of this particular pathway with conceivably a lower degree of myelination. Combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicated that in adults the termination of the AF/SLF fiber projection is compatible with functional activation in Broca's area, that is pars opercularis. In children, activation in Broca's area extended from the pars opercularis into the pars triangularis revealing an alternative connection to the temporal lobe (Wernicke's area) via the ventrally projecting extreme capsule fiber system. fMRI an…
9619148	Sex differences in the striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding characteristics in vivo.	aging	1998-06-??	OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated whether striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding characteristics in vivo are similar in men and women and whether there are sex-related differences in the decline in D2 receptor density due to aging.    METHOD: Striatal D2 receptor density (Bmax), affinity (Kd), and binding potential (Bmax/Kd) were measured with positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride in 54 healthy subjects (33 men and 21 women).    RESULTS: Women had generally lower D2 receptor affinity than men, and this difference was statistically significant in the left striatum. Bmax and Bmax/Kd tended to decline with age twice as fast in men as in women, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.    CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the age-related reduction of D2 receptor density and binding potential in both sexes in vivo. The lower D2 receptor affinity suggests an increased endogenous striatal dopamine concentration in women. This may have implications for the differe…
22673730	NF-κB accumulation associated with COL1A1 transactivators defects during chronological aging represses type I collagen expression through a -112/-61-bp region of the COL1A1 promoter in human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2012-10-??	The aging process, especially of the skin, is governed by changes in the epidermal, dermo-epidermal, and dermal compartments. Type I collagen, which is the major component of dermis extracellular matrix (ECM), constitutes a prime target for intrinsic and extrinsic aging-related alterations. In addition, under the aging process, pro-inflammatory signals are involved and collagens are fragmented owing to enhanced matrix metalloproteinase activities, and fibroblasts are no longer able to properly synthesize collagen fibrils. Here, we demonstrated that low levels of type I collagen detected in aged skin fibroblasts are attributable to an inhibition of COL1A1 transcription. Indeed, on one hand, we observed decreased binding activities of specific proteins 1 and 3, CCAAT-binding factor, and human collagen-Krüppel box, which are well-known COL1A1 transactivators acting through the -112/-61-bp promoter sequence. On the other hand, the aging process was accompanied by elevated amounts and bindi…
16158065	Top-down suppression deficit underlies working memory impairment in normal aging.	aging	2005-10-??	In this study, we assess the impact of normal aging on top-down modulation, a cognitive control mechanism that supports both attention and memory by the suppression and enhancement of sensory processing in accordance with task goals. Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), we show that healthy older adults demonstrated a prominent deficit in the suppression of cortical activity associated with task-irrelevant representations, whereas enhancement of task-relevant activity was preserved. Moreover, this suppression-specific attention deficit correlated with impaired working memory performance.
27847347	A Comparative evaluation of voxel-based spatial mapping in diffusion tensor imaging.	aging	2017-??-01	This paper presents a comparative evaluation of methods for automated voxel-based spatial mapping in diffusion tensor imaging studies. Such methods are an essential step in computational pipelines and provide anatomically comparable measurements across a population in atlas-based studies. To better understand their strengths and weaknesses, we tested a total of eight methods for voxel-based spatial mapping in two types of diffusion tensor templates. The methods were evaluated with respect to scan-rescan reliability and an application to normal aging. The methods included voxel-based analysis with and without smoothing, two types of region-based analysis, and combinations thereof with skeletonization. The templates included a study-specific template created with DTI-TK and the IIT template serving as a standard template. To control for other factors in the pipeline, the experiments used a common dataset, acquired at 1.5T with a single shell high angular resolution diffusion MR imaging p…
622208	Age-dependent distribution of acidic glycosaminoglycans in human kidney tissue.	aging	1978-??-??	Acidic glycosaminoglycans (AGAG) of human kidneys prepared from subjects of different ages were purified and determined by an enzymic assay with chondroitinases. The resulting disaccharide units and the undigested AGAG after digesting with the enzymes were identified by paper chromatography, electrophoresis and thin-layer chromatography. The age-dependent changes were: heparan sulfates accounted for 43-74% of total AGAG and the proportion to total AGAG appeared to decrease with advancing age. Dermatan sulfate remained without change. The proportion of hyaluronic acid appeared to decrease at 19-21 years and increased again with aging. The ratio of the 4-type chondroitin sulfate to the 6-type decreased with advancing age.
15024029	A role for the actin cytoskeleton in cell death and aging in yeast.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2004-03-15	Several determinants of aging, including metabolic capacity and genetic stability, are recognized in both yeast and humans. However, many aspects of the pathways leading to cell death remain to be elucidated. Here we report a role for the actin cytoskeleton both in cell death and in promoting longevity. We have analyzed yeast strains expressing mutants with either increased or decreased actin dynamics. We show that decreased actin dynamics causes depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in cell death. Important, however, is the demonstration that increasing actin dynamics, either by a specific actin allele or by deletion of a gene encoding the actin-bundling protein Scp1p, can increase lifespan by over 65%. Increased longevity appears to be due to these cells producing lower than wild-type levels of ROS. Homology between Scp1p and mammalian SM22/transgelin, which itself has been isolated in senescence screens, s…
1314924	The effect of donor age on human fibroblast beta-adrenergic receptor response and agonist-induced desensitization.	aging	1992-02-??	Aging has been associated with changes in beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-receptor) function in several tissues. The relative contribution of cellular aging and age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of receptor function is unknown. We have examined beta-receptor function in fibroblasts of young and old donors (young: mean age 31.2 +/- 0.8 years +/- S.E., n = 6; old: mean age 81.8 +/- 0.6 years +/- S.E., n = 6). Beta-receptor responses to isoproterenol (ISO), (1 microM) were similar in the two groups. The concentration of ISO required for 50% maximal beta-receptor-mediated cyclic AMP production (EC50) was similar in both groups. Fibroblast beta-receptor density was also similar in young and old groups. ISO-induced beta-receptor desensitization was both dose- and time-dependent. Submaximal desensitization by acute exposure (30 min) to ISO (1 mM) caused similar levels of beta-receptor desensitization in young (42.5 +/- 2.5%) and old (42.8 +/- 2.8%) groups and a similar increase in …
3792465	Major intrinsic polypeptide (MIP26K) from human lens membrane: characterization of low-molecular-weight forms in the aging human lens.	aging	1986-10-??	Antisera made against a C-terminal octapeptide of bovine MIP26K and against an N-terminal nonapeptide from the same protein have been used to determine the location of age-dependent cleavage sites of MIP26K in the human lens. Neither the C-terminal antiserum (anti-MIP26K256-263) nor the N-terminal antiserum (anti-MIP26K1-9) binds to the 22,000 MW form of MIP26K, suggesting cleavage from both the N- and C-terminus during lens aging. Anti-MIP26K256-263, but not anti-MIP26K1-9, binds to 20,000 and 15,000 MW forms of MIP26K, demonstrating that age-dependent production of these forms occurs by cleavage from the N-terminal side of the molecule. Together, these results show that age-dependent processing of MIP26K in the human lens occurs from both ends of the molecule, with cleavage from the N-terminal end being mainly responsible for production of the lower-molecular-weight 20,000 and 15,000 MW components.
8983941	Characterization of three isoforms of a 9 kDa gamma D-crystallin fragment isolated from human lenses.	aging	1996-06-??	The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 9 kDa gamma D-crystallin fragment, on in vivo post-translational modifications, exists as isoforms in the water soluble protein fraction of human lenses. In this study, three isoforms of the 9 kDa polypeptide (named as 9 kDa I, II and III) were identified and purified. In addition, the possible modified amino acids and their locations in the three isoforms were identified. The purification of the three isoforms was achieved by four steps which included separation of a mixture of crystallin fragments from the intact crystallins by a Sephadex G-50 chromatography under denaturing conditions, followed by purification of the 9 kDa polypeptide isoforms by a non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, preparative SDS-PAGE and HPLC using a C-18 column. Each of the isoforms showed a single protein band and a single peak during SDS-PAGE and HPLC analyses respectively. The three isoforms on their partial N-terminal sequence analyses, exhibited sequence…
3034740	Aging is without effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis in men.	aging	1986-??-??	The effects of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (o-CRF) on the secretions of ACTH, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were studied in the healthy young and elderly male individuals. o-CRF caused significant elevations of plasma ACTH, cortisol and DHEA concentrations, in all subjects. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the time-dependent responses of plasma ACTH, cortisol and DHEA to o-CRF between the young and elderly male individuals. o-CRF showed no significant rise of plasma DHEA-S, in all subjects. We conclude that the pituitary-adrenal sensitivity to the hypothalamic CRF in the elderly does not change with aging.
29070732	Thyroid status and mortality in nonagenarians from long-lived families and the general population.	longevity	2017-??-25	The relationship between thyroid status and longevity has been investigated extensively. However, data on thyroid status and survival in old age is scarce. In this study we investigated associations of different parameters of thyroid status with mortality in nonagenarians, and whether these associations were different in nonagenarians from long-lived families than in nonagenarians from the general population. In total, 805 nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study and 259 nonagenarians from the Leiden 85-plus Study were followed up to collect mortality data. At baseline, levels of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) were measured. In nonagenarians from long-lived families and from the general population, associations between thyroid parameters and mortality were similar. We found no interaction between study population and parameters of thyroid status on mortality (P-values>0.70). The results from both studies were combined to derive generalizabl…
20173016	Effect of polymorphisms in selected genes involved in pituitary-testicular function on reproductive hormones and phenotype in aging men.	aging	2010-04-??	CONTEXT: Polymorphisms in genes involved in regulation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and actions of testicular sex hormones may influence hormone balance and phenotype of aging men.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationships between polymorphisms in genes related to pituitary-testicular endocrine function and health status.    DESIGN AND SETTING: Using cross-sectional baseline data, we conducted a multinational prospective cohort observational study consisting of a population survey of community-dwelling men.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2748 men, aged 40-79 (mean +/- sd, 60.2 + 11.2) yr, were randomly recruited from eight European centers. Forty-three polymorphisms were genotyped in the following genes: androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta (ESR1 and ESR2), steroid 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2), 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), aromatase (CYP19A1), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH beta-subunit (LHB), and LH receptor (LHCGR).    MAIN OUTCOME ME…
2343063	Time resolved spectroscopic studies on the intact human lens.	aging	1990-04-??	The human lens is continually under photooxidative stress from ambient radiation. In the young lens the major absorbing (between 300-400 nm) species is the glucoside of 3-hydroxy kynurenine. Using time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on both the isolated compound and the intact human lens, the first excited singlet state of this compound is shown to have fast (ps) decay processes. This would tend to minimize damage to lens constituents because there would be little time for energy transfer into more harmful channels. Thus, this compound appears to act as a protection for the retina. With aging, human lens proteins become yellow with absorption out to 450 nm. Time resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies on intact older human lenses showed that excitation (355 nm) resulted in the formation of long lived (microseconds) transient species with an absorption maximum at ca 490 nm. Similar spectra were obtained from two model systems used to explain age related changes in human l…
23022432	Age differences of multivariate network expressions during task-switching and their associations with behavior.	aging	2012-12-??	The effect of aging on functional network activation associated with task-switching was examined in 24 young (age=25.2±2.73 years) and 23 older adults (age=65.2±2.65 years) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study goals were to (1) identify a network shared by both young and older adults, (2) identify additional networks in each age group, and (3) examine the relationship between the networks identified and behavioral performance in task-switching. Ordinal trend covariance analysis was used to identify the networks, which takes advantage of increasing activation with greater task demand to isolate the network of regions recruited by task-switching. Two task-related networks were found: a shared network that was strongly expressed by both young and older adults and a second network identified in the young data that was residualized from the shared network. Both networks consisted of regions associated with task-switching in previous studies including the middle fron…
18823239	Age-related alterations in simple declarative memory and the effect of negative stimulus valence.	aging	2009-10-??	Healthy aging has been shown to modulate the neural circuitry underlying simple declarative memory; however, the functional impact of negative stimulus valence on these changes has not been fully investigated. Using BOLD fMRI, we explored the effects of aging on behavioral performance, neural activity, and functional coupling during the encoding and retrieval of novel aversive and neutral scenes. Behaviorally, there was a main effect of valence with better recognition performance for aversive greater than neutral stimuli in both age groups. There was also a main effect of age with better recognition performance in younger participants compared to older participants. At the imaging level, there was a main effect of valence with increased activity in the medial-temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus) during both encoding and retrieval of aversive relative to neutral stimuli. There was also a main effect of age with older participants showing decreased engagement of medial-temporal lobe …
20696496	Impact of changed positive and negative task-related brain activity on word-retrieval in aging.	aging	2012-04-??	Previous functional imaging studies that compared activity patterns in older and younger adults during nonlinguistic tasks found evidence for 2 phenomena: older participants usually show more pronounced task-related positive activity in the brain hemisphere that is not dominant for the task and less pronounced negative task-related activity in temporo-parietal and midline brain regions. The combined effects of these phenomena and the impact on word retrieval, however, have not yet been assessed. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore task-related positive (active task > baseline) and negative activity (baseline > active task) during semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tasks. Increased right frontal positive activity during the semantic task and reduced negative activity in the right hemisphere during both tasks was associated with reduced performance in older subjects. No substantial relationship between changes in positive and negative activity was observed in the o…
25305568	Age-related differences in medial temporal lobe involvement during conceptual fluency.	aging	2015-07-01	Not all memory processes are equally affected by aging. A widely accepted hypothesis is that older adults rely more on familiarity-based processing, typically linked with the perirhinal cortex (PRC), in the context of impaired recollection, linked with the hippocampus (HC). However, according to the dedifferentiation hypothesis, healthy aging reduces the specialization of MTL memory subregions so that they may mediate different memory processes than in young adults. Using fMRI, we tested this possibility using a conceptual fluency manipulation known to induce familiarity-related PRC activity. The study yielded two main findings. First, although fluency equivalently affected PRC in both young (18-28; N=14) and older (62-80; N=15) adults, it also uniquely affected HC activity in older adults. Second, the fluency manipulation reduced functional connectivity between HC and PRC in young adults, but it increased it in older adults. Taken together, the results suggest that aging may result in…
623414	Studies on cochlear aqueduct patency.	aging	????-??-??	Complex studies on the patency of the cochlear aqueduct were made on 250 human cadavers and the temporal bones isolated from these, using a chemical method (staining reaction) as well as filling the aqueduct with fluid plastics and exposing the whole of its course under an operating microscope. The disappearance of patency in the cochlear aqueduct is a progressive phenomenon reflecting the biological process of aging in the organism. Patency of the cochlear aqueduct renders possible a two-way spread of infection from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the inner ear and vice versa, CSF otorrhea, and sudden sensorineural hearing inpairment through rises in CSF pressure, while in the absence of patency, the accumulation of harmful products of metabolism in the perilymph has a deleterious effect on the sensory elements of the inner ear.
28760157	Factors associated with consumption of alcohol in older adults - a comparison between two cultures, China and Norway: the CLHLS and the HUNT-study.	longevity	2017-??-31	BACKGROUND: There is little knowledge about the consumption of alcohol among Chinese and Norwegian older adults aged 65 years and over. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors related to alcohol consumption among older adults in China and Norway.    METHODS: The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) data in 2008-2009 conducted in China and The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study data in 2006-2008 (HUNT3) conducted in Norway were used. Mulitvariable logistic regression was used to test the factors related to alcohol consumption.    RESULTS: The prevalence of participants who drink alcohol in the Chinese and Norwegian sample were 19.88% and 46.2%, respectively. The weighted prevalence of participants with consumption of alcohol in the Chinese sample of women and men were 7.20% and 34.14%, respectively. In the Norwegian sample, the prevalence of consumption of alcohol were 43.31% and 65.35% for women and men, respectively. Factors such as younger age, h…
6813368	Age-related differences in human skin collagen: solubility in solvent, susceptibility to pepsin digestion, and the spectrum of the solubilized polymeric collagen molecules.	aging	1982-11-??	Age-related differences of human skin collagen in solubility, susceptibility to pepsin digestion, and the spectrum of collagen molecules were systematically examined. Less than .5% of the skin collagen were solubilized in a neutral salt solution. The solubility in acetic acid decreased rapidly during maturation and then slowly with age. Insoluble collagen from an infant was almost completely solubilized by pepsin digestion, whereas most of that from the elderly individuals remained insoluble even after four repeated times of pepsin digestion. The solubilized collagen was considered to contain a considerable amount of polymeric molecules. Characteristically, the amount of the Millipore-retained fraction of pepsin-solubilized collagen was prominent at the fourth decade. These differences represent the aging process of collagen.

Adverse socioeconomic conditions are associated with increased plasma levels of these molecules, especially interleukin (IL)-6. Considering the differential profile of elderly Brazilians regarding their socioeconomic and cultural aspects, the objectives of this study were: to assess the correlation and differences between levels of IL-6 and socioeconomic status (education and income) in elderly women. IL-6 levels were measured using ELISA. The Spearman test was used to determine the correlation between IL-6 and socioeconomic status, and the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests for cytokine level differences across education and income. IL-6 showed a significant inverse correlation with education (r = -0.205, p = 0.014) and income (r = -0.185, p = 0.028). Differences in IL-6 levels were registered across the education variables. The results corroborate evidence that low socioeconomic status is related to higher IL-6 plas…
8618047	Elevation of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist in the stratum corneum of sun-exposed and ultraviolet B-irradiated human skin.	aging	1996-05-??	Keratinocytes produce not only interleukin 1 (IL-1) but also IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), a competitive inhibitor of IL-1. Because little is known about the presence of IL-1ra in the stratum corneum, we examined the content of IL-1ra in the stratum corneum, especially the balance between IL-1 and IL-1ra. IL-1 alpha and IL-1ra, but not IL-1 beta, were detected in the tape-stripped stratum corneum of healthy volunteers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. IL-1 alpha and IL-1ra were bioactive as determined by thymocyte co-stimulation assay, and their molecular masses were 17 and 20 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the stratum corneum contains active forms of IL-1 alpha and IL-1ra produced by keratinocytes. The stratum corneum of an unexposed area, the inner side of the upper arm. contained more IL-1 alpha than a sun-exposed area, the face. In contrast, the stratum corneum of the sun-exposed area contained a markedly higher amount of IL-1ra than that of the unexposed area. The ra…
18303982	Age-related differences in brain activity during true and false memory retrieval.	aging	2008-08-??	Compared to young adults, older adults show not only a reduction in true memories but also an increase in false memories. We investigated the neural bases of these age effects using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a false memory task that resembles the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Young and older participants were scanned during a word recognition task that included studied words and new words that were strongly associated with studied words (critical lures). During correct recognition of studied words (true memory), older adults showed weaker activity than young adults in the hippocampus but stronger activity than young adults in the retrosplenial cortex. The hippocampal reduction is consistent with age-related deficits in recollection, whereas the retrosplenial increase suggests compensatory recruitment of alternative recollection-related regions. During incorrect recognition of critical lures (false memory), older adults displayed stronger activity than young a…
12015342	Aged men display blunted biorhythmic variation of muscle performance and physiological responses.	aging	2002-06-??	Aging is known to disrupt the "biological clock" that governs physiological variables at rest. This study sought to determine whether aged men demonstrated biorhythmic variation in muscle performance during resistance exercise and physiological responses to that stimulus. Ten aged (75.6 +/- 1.6 yr; mean +/- SE) men completed an isokinetic testing protocol of knee extensors and flexors at 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 h. Although time of day variation in peak torque was detectable, significant (P < or = 0.05) oscillation was established only in the knee flexors at 3.14 rad/s. Heart rate, blood pressure, and rectal temperature displayed no significant variation, but trends (P < 0.10) in oscillation of postexercise blood pressure and rectal temperature were noted. Temporal patterns in biorhythmic variation of muscle performance, as well as thermal and cardiovascular measures, emulated those observed in a previous study involving young men where the magnitude of variation was sufficient to ac…
7029165	Loss of organized fibronectin matrix from the surface of aging diploid fibroblasts (IMR-90).	lifespan	1981-??-??	Indirect immunofluorescence was used to investigate the production of a fibrillar fibronectin matrix by human diploid fibroblasts (IMR-90) as cells progress through their in vitro lifespan. Early and mid-passage cultures displayed a prominent fibrillar reticulum over the cell layer which formed within 24 hours of seeding. Even sparsely seeded early-passage cells exhibited fibrils of fibronectin on external surfaces. In contrast, fibrillar fibronectin was reduced or absent on surfaces of late-passage cells. However, the larger, non-proliferating, late-passage cells were producing fibronectin, 1h determined by radioimmunoassay of the medium.
23011920	Morphological evidence for enhanced kisspeptin and neurokinin B signaling in the infundibular nucleus of the aging man.	aging	2012-11-??	Peptidergic neurons synthesizing kisspeptin (KP) and neurokinin B (NKB) in the hypothalamic infundibular nucleus have been implicated in negative sex steroid feedback to GnRH neurons. In laboratory rodents, testosterone decreases KP and NKB expression in this region. In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that the weakening of this inhibitory testosterone feedback in elderly men coincides with enhanced KP and NKB signaling in the infundibular nucleus. This central hypothesis was tested in a series of immunohistochemical studies on hypothalamic sections of male human individuals that were divided into arbitrary "young" (21-49 yr, n = 11) and "aged" (50-67 yr, n = 9) groups. Quantitative immunohistochemical experiments established that the regional densities of NKB-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya and fibers, and the incidence of afferent contacts they formed onto GnRH neurons, exceeded several times those of the KP-IR elements. Robust aging-dependent enhancements were identified…
20578173	Correlations of striatal dopamine synthesis with default network deactivations during working memory in younger adults.	aging	2011-06-??	Age-related deficits have been demonstrated in working memory performance and in the dopamine system thought to support it. We performed positron emission tomography (PET) scans on 12 younger (mean 22.7 years) and 19 older (mean 65.8 years) adults using the radiotracer 6-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (FMT), which measures dopamine synthesis capacity. Subjects also underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a delayed recognition working memory task. We evaluated age-related fMRI activity differences and examined how they related to FMT signal variations in dorsal caudate within each age group. In posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/Pc), older adults showed diminished fMRI deactivations during memory recognition compared with younger adults. Greater task-induced deactivation (in younger adults only) was associated both with higher FMT signal and with worse memory performance. Our results suggest that dopamine synthesis helps modulate default network a…
16768356	Age-related changes in object processing and contextual binding revealed using fMR adaptation.	aging	2006-04-??	Using fMR adaptation, we studied the effects of aging on the neural processing of passively viewed naturalistic pictures composed of a prominent object against a background scene. Spatially distinct neural regions showing specific patterns of adaptation to objects, background scenes, and contextual integration (binding) were identified in young adults. Older adults did not show adaptation responses corresponding to binding in the medial-temporal areas. They also showed an adaptation deficit for objects whereby their lateral occipital complex (LOC) did not adapt to repeated objects in the context of a changing background. The LOC could be activated, however, when objects were presented without a background. Moreover, the adaptation deficit for objects viewed against backgrounds was reversed when elderly subjects were asked to attend to objects while viewing these complex pictures. These findings suggest that the elderly have difficulty with simultaneous processing of objects and backgro…
21384152	MnSOD activity regulates hydroxytyrosol-induced extension of chronological lifespan.	lifespan	2012-02-??	Chronological lifespan (CLS) is defined as the duration of quiescence in which normal cells retain the capacity to reenter the proliferative cycle. This study investigates whether hydroxytyrosol (HT), a naturally occurring polyphenol found in olives, extends CLS in normal human fibroblasts (NHFs). Quiescent NHFs cultured for a long duration (30-60 days) lose their capacity to repopulate. Approximately 60% of these cells exit the cell cycle permanently; a significant increase in the doubling time of the cell population was observed. CLS was extended in quiescent NHFs that were cultured in the presence of HT for 30-60 days. HT-induced extension of CLS was associated with an approximately 3-fold increase in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity while there was no change in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase protein levels. Quiescent NHFs overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant form of MnSOD failed to extend CLS. HT suppressed age-associated i…
3600950	Divergent changes in D-1 and D-2 dopamine binding sites in human brain during aging.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	The density of D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors in human caudate nucleus and putamen, obtained postmortem, were studied throughout the adult lifespan using [3H]fluphenazine as the dopamine receptor ligand. The D-1 subtype increased progressively with age in both regions, while the D-2 subtype declined in caudate nucleus. The ratio of D-1/D-2 Bmax in both regions increased from approximately 1 at age 20 to 2 by age 75. The dopamine content in putamen declined with age and was inversely correlated with D-1 receptor density. We suggest that D-1 receptor density is up-regulated by loss of dopamine during aging. The D-2 receptor density in caudate nucleus was positively correlated with choline acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that loss of intrastriatal neurons with age may contribute to the decrease in D-2 sites. These divergent changes in dopamine receptor subtypes with age result in an altered complement of dopamine receptors in older humans and may provide a basis for selective pharm…
6852543	Changes in the concentration and composition of human brain gangliosides with aging.	aging	1983-??-??	Ganglioside content and composition were studied in whole brains from 9 neurologically normal male individuals ranging from 25 to 85 years in age. The content of ganglioside-bound sialic acid decreased from 1,070 to 380 micrograms/g fresh tissue at 85 years. Ten individual ganglioside fractions were identified on high-performance thin-layer chromatography, seven of which were quantified. With age, ganglioside composition shifted to a more polar pattern due to an increase in the relative concentration of the more polar fractions GQ1b, GT1b and GD1b and a decrease in GD1a and GM1. Except for GQ1b, the absolute concentration of all gangliosides decreased with age. All changes were more pronounced in younger ages. Results are discussed in relation to structural changes occurring in the aging brain, and the involvement of gangliosides is suggested.
12890070	Age-related changes of circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles.	aging	2003-08-??	OBJECTIVES: To compare relationships between the sleep-wake cycle and endogenous circadian rhythms in young and older adults and to examine correlates between evening naps and circadian rhythms in older adults.    DESIGN: For 1 week of home recording, subjects wore wrist-activity monitors and kept daily sleep logs. After the home monitoring, subjects entered the laboratory on a 90-minute sleep-wake schedule and were monitored on this schedule for at least 30 hours.    SETTING: Community living and laboratory.    PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven young adults, aged 18 to 32, and 56 older adults, aged 60 to 75, who were healthy and had few sleep complaints.    MEASUREMENTS: Times of nocturnal sleep, out-of-bed napping, and illumination were obtained at home. Sleep propensity and oral body temperature (OBT) were measured in the laboratory, along with circadian rhythms of cortisol and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s, assayed from urine samples collected every 90 minutes).    RESULTS: Home sleep times …
22760818	B-type natriuretic peptides in acute coronary syndromes: implications in an aging population.	aging	2012-11-??	B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) are increasingly recognized as prognostic markers in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The need for novel and more effective tools for risk assessment cannot be more emphasized than in older patients with ACS given their atypical presentation, multiple comorbidities, and higher risk for mortality and morbidity. Accurate interpretation of B-type NP values in older patients with ACS, however, may be confounded by several aging-related physiologic changes. Advanced age, reduction in body mass, and kidney function and anemia have been associated with higher BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations, and may create challenges with interpreting NP levels in the elderly. This review highlights the need to better understand the physiology of BNP and NT-proBNP in older individuals and their prognostic value in older patients with ACS.
28755870	Use of near-infrared spectroscopy in the investigation of brain activation during cognitive aging: A systematic review of an emerging area of research.	aging	2017-09-??	The cognitive neuroscience of aging is a growing and stimulating research area. The development of neuroimaging techniques in the past two decades has considerably increased our understanding of the brain mechanisms that might underlie cognitive performance and resulting changes due to normal aging. Beside traditional metabolic neuroimaging techniques, such as Positron Emission Tomography and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical imaging technique allowing to monitor real-time cerebral blood oxygenation, has gained recent interest in this field. The aim of the present review paper, after briefly presenting the NIRS technique, is to review and to summarize the recent results of neuroimaging studies using this technique in the field of cognitive aging. The reviewed literature shows that, despite low spatial resolution and cerebral depth penetration, this technique provides consistent findings on the reduced hemodynamic activity as a function…
11074660	Modulation of steroidogenesis in human ovarian granulosa cells during aging.	aging	2000-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the steroid production (progesterone [P] and estradiol [E2]) by cultured human granulosa cells (GCs) during aging.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human ovarian GCs and granulosa-luteal cells (GLCs) were isolated from ovaries of female patients (young and premenopausal) undergoing surgery for non-ovarian benign gynecological conditions. Cells were cultured with ET-1 in the presence or in the absence of FSH. The concentrations of P and E2 in conditioned media were determined by means of RIA.    RESULTS: In human GCs and GLCs obtained from young and premenopausal women, ET-1 in vitro can significantly reduce the FSH stimulated biosynthesis of P, whereas the basal P biosynthesis is only insignificantly diminished. The in vitro application of ET-1 have only a sparse inhibitory effect on both the basal and FSH stimulated biosynthesis of E2 in GCs from the two patient groups.    CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the opinion tha…
27585371	Development of hippocampal functional connectivity during childhood.	aging	2017-??-??	The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure involved in memory, spatial navigation, and regulation of stress responses, making it a structure critical to daily functioning. However, little is known about the functional development of the hippocampus during childhood due to methodological challenges of acquiring neuroimaging data in young participants. This is a critical gap given evidence that hippocampally-mediated behaviors (e.g., episodic memory) undergo rapid and important changes during childhood. To address this gap, the present investigation collected resting-state fMRI scans in 97, 4- to 10-year-old children. Whole brain seed-based analyses of anterior, posterior, and whole hippocampal connectivity were performed to identify regions demonstrating stable (i.e., age-controlled) connectivity profiles as well as age-related differences in connectivity. Results reveal that the hippocampus is a highly connected structure of the brain and that most of the major components of t…
10080102	Stability of natural self-reactive antibody repertoires during aging.	aging	1999-01-??	We have used a quantitative immunoblotting technique to analyze the repertoires of self-reactive antibodies in serum samples obtained from the same five healthy adults over a 25-year interval. The average age of the donors was 43 years at the time of the first serum sample and 69 years at the time of the second serum sample. The antibody repertoires of IgM and IgG were found to be strikingly similar among individuals in both early and late samples. Densitometric profiles of self-reactivity of serum IgM and of purified serum IgG remained unchanged over the 25-year interval. The total reactivity of serum IgG decreased significantly over the 25-year period. The observed stability of the natural self-reactive IgM and IgG antibody repertoires with aging supports the view that autoreactive B cells in the normal immune system are positively selected for reactivity with a limited set of immunodominant self-antigens throughout life.
16775129	The mellow years?: neural basis of improving emotional stability over age.	lifespan, aging	2006-06-14	Contrary to the pervasive negative stereotypes of human aging, emotional functions may improve with advancing age. However, the brain mechanisms underlying changes in emotional function over age remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that emotional stability improves linearly over seven decades (12-79 years) of the human lifespan. We used both functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potential recording to examine the neural basis of this improvement. With these multimodal techniques, we show that better stability is predicted by a shift toward greater medial prefrontal control over negative emotional input associated with increased activity later in the processing sequence (beyond 200 ms after stimulus) and less control over positive input, related to a decrease in early activity (within 150 ms). This shift was independent from gray matter loss, indexed by structural magnetic resonance data. We propose an integrative model in which accumulated life experience and the moti…
11716001	Does the menopause influence the risk of bacteriuria?	aging	2001-??-??	The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the risk of bacteriuria is increased as a result of estrogen deprivation following the menopause. All midstream urine samples (MSU) sent to the King's College Hospital department of microbiology by general practitioners in 1997 were assessed. Bacteriuria was diagnosed when the bacterial count was >10(5) organisms/ml. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the effects of age and sex on the likelihood of having a positive result. Non-linear effects of age were investigated, with interest focusing in particlar on the time around the menopause. There were 15,392 MSU samples analyzed; 11,811 (77%) were from women and 3581 (23%) from men. In both sexes the proportion of positive results increased with increasing age (P<0.0001). The specimens taken from women were significantly more likely to be positive than those taken from a man of the same age (P<0.0001). In women there was no evidence of any non-linear relatio…
17208260	Children's and adults' neural bases of verbal and nonverbal 'theory of mind'.	aging	2007-04-08	Theory of mind (ToM) - our ability to predict behaviors of others in terms of their underlying intentions - has been examined through verbal and nonverbal false-belief (FB) tasks. Previous brain imaging studies of ToM in adults have implicated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) for adults' ToM ability. To examine age and modality related differences and similarities in neural correlates of ToM, we tested 16 adults (18-40 years old) and 12 children (8-12 years old) with verbal (story) and nonverbal (cartoon) FB tasks, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both age groups showed significant activity in the TPJ bilaterally and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in a modality-independent manner, indicating that these areas are important for ToM during both adulthood and childhood, regardless of modality. We also found significant age-related differences in the ToM condition-specific activity for the story and cartoon tasks in the left inferi…
12954485	Marked increase with age of type 1 cytokines within memory and effector/cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in humans: a contribution to understand the relationship between inflammation and immunosenescence.	aging	2003-09-??	The ageing process is characterized by a progressive exhaustion of the naïve T cell reservoir that is accompanied by a compensatory expansion of effector/cytotoxic CD8+CD28- T cells. However, the origin and function of this subpopulation is not completely clarified. In this study, we examined the intracellular cytokine profile in purified CD8+ T cells obtained from 29 healthy subjects of different ages. Type 1 (IFN-gamma IL-2 and TNF-alpha) and type 2 (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) cytokines were determined in three CD8+ T subsets, i.e. CD95-CD28+ (naïve), CD95+CD28- (effector/cytotoxic), and CD95+CD28+ (memory). As a general trend, we observed, in aged subjects, an increase of type 1 and type 2 intracellular cytokines within the three CD8+ subsets. In particular, we showed that type 1 cytokine-positive cells significantly increased, with age, among all the CD8+ subsets, while a marked increase of type 2 producing cells was observed only in memory CD8+ T cells. These profound changes are compa…
994563	The age-dependent decrease in creatine kinase and aldolase activities in human striated muscle is not caused by an accumulation of faulty proteins.	aging	1976-??-??	In human striated muscle obtained in surgery, an age-dependent decrease in aldolase and creatine kinase specific activities and an increase in DNA content per wet weight was found. In the group of the elderly (64-84 years), the enzymes decreased by 40-60% when compared with a group between 24 and 47 years old, while DNA content rose by a factor of 1.53 indicating loss of tissue water. Titration of aldolase and creatine kinase molecules by specific antibodies against aldolase A and creatine kinase MM isozymes, respectively, revealed very little accumulation of aldolase cross-reacting materials in the old age group (1.13 fold), and no accumulation of inactive creatine kinase molecules. Similar conclusions can be drawn from thermostability analyses of these two enzymes. The data do not support the view that accumulation of modified proteins due to random errors or to post-translational alternations is a general or causative phenomenon of aging in human muscle tissue.
28602813	Automated segmentation of midbrain structures with high iron content.	aging	2018-??-15	The substantia nigra (SN), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the red nucleus (RN) are midbrain structures of ample interest in many neuroimaging studies, which may benefit from the availability of automated segmentation methods. The high iron content of these structures awards them high contrast in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images. We present a novel segmentation method that leverages the information of these images to produce automated segmentations of the SN, STN, and RN. The algorithm builds a map of spatial priors for the structures by non-linearly registering a set of manually-traced training labels to the midbrain. The priors are used to inform a Gaussian mixture model of the image intensities, with smoothness constraints imposed to ensure anatomical plausibility. The method was validated on manual segmentations from a sample of 40 healthy younger and older subjects. Average Dice scores were 0.81 (0.05) for the SN, 0.66 (0.14) for the STN and 0.88 (0.04) for the …
16494683	Age-related changes in brain activity across the adult lifespan.	aging	2006-02-??	A number of theories have emerged to explain the well-studied changes in memory that occur with age. Many of these theories invoke mechanisms that have the potential to affect multiple cognitive domains, in addition to memory. Such mechanisms include alterations in attentional or inhibitory function, or dysfunction of specific brain areas, such as the frontal lobes. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during encoding and recognition tasks in young, middle-aged, and older adults to identify correlations between age and brain activity across the various tasks. The goal was to see whether these correlations were task-specific or common across tasks, and to determine whether age differences emerged in a linear fashion over the adult years. Across all memory tasks, at both encoding and recognition, linear increases of activity with age were found in areas normally decreased during task performance (e.g., medial front…
19161396	Application of nonlinear optical microscopy for imaging skin.	aging	????-??-??	Recent advances in the use of nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) in skin microscopy are presented. Nonresonant spectroscopies including second harmonic generation, coherent anti-Stokes Raman and two-photon absorption are described and applications to problems in skin biology are detailed. These nonlinear techniques have several advantages over traditional microscopy methods that rely on one-photon excitation: intrinsic 3D imaging with <1 microm spatial resolution, decreased photodamage to tissue samples and penetration depths up to 1,000 microm with the use of near-infrared lasers. Thanks to these advantages, nonlinear optical spectroscopy has become a powerful tool to study the physical and biochemical properties of the skin. Structural information can be obtained using the response of endogenous chemical species in the skin, such as collagen or lipids, indicating that optical biopsy may replace current invasive, time-consuming traditional histology methods. Insertion of specific pro…
6655161	Changes in vitamin E concentrations in human plasma and platelets with age.	aging	1983-??-??	It has been postulated that vitamin E compounds (tocopherols) can retard the aging process. Therefore, changes in concentrations of tocopherols in human plasma and platelets with aging were studied. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 48 healthy male volunteers aged 24-91 years. Concentrations of the tocopherols in plasma and platelets were determined by a liquid chromatographic method. Alpha and gamma tocopherols were the major forms of vitamin E found in both plasma and platelets. The concentrations of alpha and total tocopherols in plasma did not change significantly with age. However, the plasma gamma tocopherol and the platelet alpha, gamma, and total tocopherol concentrations decreased significantly with age. The platelet to plasma ratios of tocopherol concentrations also decreased with age.
14501023	Steroid hormones and cognitive functioning in aging men: a mini-review.	aging	2003-??-??	The decrease in testosterone (T) production in aging men has been well documented. Because the majority of circulating estradiol (E2) in men arises through aromatization of T, levels of E2 decrease as well with increasing age. It is also clear that some proportion of men develop impairments in aspects of cognition, particularly in explicit memory and language abilities with normal aging. Although there is a paucity of studies that have attempted to determine whether the decline in the endocrine and cognitive changes in older men are related, findings from the extant literature provide some support for the notion that estrogen is important for aspects of memory in aging men, just as it is in women, whereas T helps to maintain visuospatial abilities. More definitive conclusions on the relationship between the sex hormones and specific cognitive functions in men await more careful investigation in this area in the future.
21056419	The relative contributions of non-enzymatic glycation and cortical porosity on the fracture toughness of aging bone.	aging	2011-01-11	The risk of fracture increases with age due to the decline of bone mass and bone quality. One of the age-related changes in bone quality occurs through the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) due to non-enzymatic glycation (NEG). However as a number of other changes including increased porosity occur with age and affect bone fragility, the relative contribution of AGEs on the fracture resistance of aging bone is unknown. Using a high-resolution nonlinear finite element model that incorporate cohesive elements and micro-computed tomography-based 3d meshes, we investigated the contribution of AGEs and cortical porosity on the fracture toughness of human bone. The results show that NEG caused a 52% reduction in propagation fracture toughness (R-curve slope). The combined effects of porosity and AGEs resulted in an 88% reduction in propagation toughness. These findings are consistent with previous experimental results. The model captured the age-related cha…
17961760	Effect of cellular aging on collagen biosynthesis: I. Methodological considerations and pharmacological applications.	aging	????-??-??	The study of the age and passage dependent modifications of collagen biosynthesis requires a simple, rapid and reproducible procedure adaptable to serial cell cultures. To make such a method comparable to other methods of collagen determination, we calibrated a colorimetric procedure both by hydroxyproline (HYP) determinations and in terms of collagen concentration. For collagen types I and IV, widely different slopes were obtained with the colorimetric procedure. To further refine the procedure, we tempted to completely inhibit collagen synthesis by beta-aminopropionitrile (beta APN) added to cultures in order to obtain a negative control. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl 2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT-test), it could be shown that relatively high concentrations of beta APN are tolerated by the cells. It appeared, however, that even the highest concentration of beta APN (1mM) still tolerated by the fibroblasts did not completely inhibit collagen synthesis. At low conce…
538	Effect on aging on plasma renin and aldosterone in normal man.	aging	1975-11-??	The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects. Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced. Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered i…
6673990	Age-related changes in sulfation of basement membrane glycosaminoglycans.	aging	1983-??-??	Alterations in heparan sulfate, the principal glycosaminoglycan species in glomerular basement membrane, have been proposed as contributory to permeability changes in nephropathic disorders. In the present study, the extent of sulfation of glycosaminoglycans isolated from pronase digests of human glomerular basement membrane, obtained from subjects 15-89 years old, was examined. The sulfate to hexuronic acid ratio significantly diminished as a function of increasing age. These results suggest that decreased sulfation of glycosaminoglycans and consequent reduction in net negative charge alters permselective properties of the glomerular basement membrane with aging.
18691562	Altered prefrontal function with aging: insights into age-associated performance decline.	aging	2008-09-26	We examined the effects of aging on visuo-spatial attention. Participants performed a bi-field visual selective attention task consisting of infrequent target and task-irrelevant novel stimuli randomly embedded among repeated standards in either attended or unattended visual fields. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to the different classes of stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The older group had slower reaction times to targets, and committed more false alarms but had comparable detection accuracy to young controls. Attended target and novel stimuli activated comparable widely distributed attention networks, including anterior and posterior association cortex, in both groups. The older group had reduced spatial extent of activation in several regions, including prefrontal, basal ganglia, and visual processing areas. In particular, the anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus showed more restricted activation in older compared with…
28554889	Development of Glutamatergic Proteins in Human Visual Cortex across the Lifespan.	lifespan, aging	2017-??-21	Traditionally, human primary visual cortex (V1) has been thought to mature within the first few years of life, based on anatomical studies of synapse formation, and establishment of intracortical and intercortical connections. Human vision, however, develops well beyond the first few years. Previously, we found prolonged development of some GABAergic proteins in human V1 (Pinto et al., 2010). Yet as >80% of synapses in V1 are excitatory, it remains unanswered whether the majority of synapses regulating experience-dependent plasticity and receptive field properties develop late, like their inhibitory counterparts. To address this question, we used Western blotting of postmortem tissue from human V1 (12 female, 18 male) covering a range of ages. Then we quantified a set of postsynaptic glutamatergic proteins (PSD-95, GluA2, GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B), calculated indices for functional pairs that are developmentally regulated (GluA2:GluN1; GluN2A:GluN2B), and determined interindividual variab…
27079918	Marital Disruption and Allostatic Load in Late Life.	aging	2017-06-??	OBJECTIVE: This study examines the link between marital disruption and biological risk, and asks whether the association of this precarious life event with health is contingent on marital loss duration and history.    METHOD: Data are drawn from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project ( N = 1,414), and Poisson regressions are presented for allostatic load and logistic regressions for individual biomarkers.    RESULTS: The currently unmarried with more distant marital disruptions exhibit higher levels of allostatic load than the currently married, which is primarily driven by dysregulation of cardiovascular and metabolic indicators. Results also reveal the differing ways marital disruption "gets under the skin" with widowhood associated with compromised inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular functioning, and divorce with cardiovascular and neuroendocrine markers.    DISCUSSION: Findings lend support for both the crisis and chronic strain models, and likely reflect norma…
3570688	Quantitation of membrane-associated crystallins from aging and cataractous human lenses.	aging	1987-05-??	Membrane from individual cataractous and normal human lenses has been prepared by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. A sensitive solid-phase radioimmunoassay has been developed to quantitate the levels of alpha, beta, and gamma crystallins associated with membrane obtained from each sucrose gradient interface. The results of this analysis demonstrate significant levels of all three crystallins associated with purified membrane. Although the relative percentage of each membrane-associated crystallin does not change during aging and/or cataractogenesis of the human lens, membrane from cataractous lenses in characterized by greater total amounts of crystallins associated with purified membrane obtained from denser interfaces of the discontinuous sucrose gradient.
1319530	The effect of in vitro aging on human lung fibroblast beta-adrenergic receptor density, coupling and response.	aging	1992-05-??	Age-related changes in regulation of receptor response have been observed in several tissues and include regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-receptor) responses. The role of cellular aging in age-related changes in receptor response is not clear. We have examined the effect of aging in vitro on human fibroblast beta-receptor function. MRC-5 (embryonic lung) fibroblasts were aged by replication to produce cells of early, middle and late stages corresponding to the following cumulative population doublings: 15-20, 35-45 and greater than 50, respectively. Fibroblast membrane beta-receptor responses to isoproterenol (ISO, 0.1 mM) did not differ between the three stages. Adenylate cyclase responses to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, 1 microM), guanosine triphosphate (GTP, 0.1 mM) and 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p, 0.1 mM) were also similar between the stages. Beta-receptor density (Bmax) was unaffected by in vitro aging. Beta-receptor agonist affinity, an indication of the capacity f…
10368359	Age and renal prostaglandin inhibition during exercise and heat stress.	aging	1999-06-??	Aging is associated with a number of physiological changes that may cause the kidney to rely to a greater extent on vasodilatory PGs for normal functioning. Acute exercise has been shown to cause renal vasoconstriction that may be partially buffered by vasodilatory PGs. To determine the relative importance of renal PGs during exercise in older adults, we compared the renal effects of the PG inhibitor ibuprofen (1.2 g/day for 3 days) vs. a placebo control in a cohort of eight younger (24 +/- 2 yr) and eight older (64 +/- 2 yr) women during treadmill exercise ( approximately 57% maximal oxygen consumption) in the heat (36 degrees C). This over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen reduced renal PG (i.e., PGE2) excretion by 47% (P < 0. 05). Acute exercise in the heat caused dramatic decreases in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, and sodium excretion in both age groups. PG inhibition was associated with greater decreases in urine production and free water clearance (P < 0.05). There we…
7944302	Age-dependent decline of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function: a positron emission tomographic study of grandparents and their grandchildren.	aging	1994-10-??	Despite postmortem evidence for an age-related decline in nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, position emission tomography (PET) studies have produced inconsistent results. This may be due to differences in methods or of subject selection. To investigate further the effect of age on dopaminergic function, we performed PET with 6-L-[18F]fluorodopa (FD) on 12 pairs of grandchildren and their grandparents. The FD uptake rate constant (Ki) was calculated using a graphical method for the whole striatum to avoid confounding of the results by striatal atrophy. The mean Ki was significantly lower in grandparents (p = 0.020). These PET observations represent in vivo confirmation of postmortem evidence that nigrostriatal dopaminergic function declines with aging.
18479941	Temporal dynamics of perisylvian activation during language processing in children and adults.	aging	2008-07-15	The perisylvian region of the human cortex is known to play a major role in language processing. Especially the superior temporal cortex (STC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) have been investigated with respect to their particular involvement in language comprehension. In the present research, the timing of recruitment of these language-related brain areas in both hemispheres was examined as a function of age using functional imaging data of 6-year-old children and adults with a special focus on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response time courses. The results show that children's activation time courses differ from that of adults. First, children show an overall later peak of BOLD responses. Second, children's IFC responds much later than their STC, while in adults the difference between both regions is less pronounced. Within the STC, both groups show similar regionally U-shaped activation patterns with fastest peaks in voxels at the STC's mid-portion around Heschl's …
23133589	Bitter taste receptor polymorphisms and human aging.	longevity, aging	2012-??-??	Several studies have shown that genetic factors account for 25% of the variation in human life span. On the basis of published molecular, genetic and epidemiological data, we hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms of taste receptors, which modulate food preferences but are also expressed in a number of organs and regulate food absorption processing and metabolism, could modulate the aging process. Using a tagging approach, we investigated the possible associations between longevity and the common genetic variation at the three bitter taste receptor gene clusters on chromosomes 5, 7 and 12 in a population of 941 individuals ranging in age from 20 to 106 years from the South of Italy. We found that one polymorphism, rs978739, situated 212 bp upstream of the TAS2R16 gene, shows a statistically significant association (p = 0.001) with longevity. In particular, the frequency of A/A homozygotes increases gradually from 35% in subjects aged 20 to 70 up to 55% in centenarians. These data prov…
20501485	Expected value information improves financial risk taking across the adult life span.	aging	2011-04-??	When making decisions, individuals must often compensate for cognitive limitations, particularly in the face of advanced age. Recent findings suggest that age-related variability in striatal activity may increase financial risk-taking mistakes in older adults. In two studies, we sought to further characterize neural contributions to optimal financial risk taking and to determine whether decision aids could improve financial risk taking. In Study 1, neuroimaging analyses revealed that individuals whose mesolimbic activation correlated with the expected value estimates of a rational actor made more optimal financial decisions. In Study 2, presentation of expected value information improved decision making in both younger and older adults, but the addition of a distracting secondary task had little impact on decision quality. Remarkably, provision of expected value information improved the performance of older adults to match that of younger adults at baseline. These findings are consiste…
12470971	Relaxographic studies of aging normal human lenses.	aging	2002-12-??	Ten excised normal human lenses of various ages were studied. Seven sections of each lens, from anterior outer cortex to posterior outer cortex were imaged and the T(1) (spin-lattice) and T(2) (spin-spin) relaxation data on each section were collected. T(1) and T(2) relaxation were analysed by fitting pixel intensity to one term exponential expressions. Both T(1) and T(2) relaxation times showed minimal values in the nuclear region and maxima at the two outer cortexes. The pre-exponential terms of the fittings of both T(1) and T(2) relaxation,M(1) and M(2), were normalized in order to eliminate instrumental variations over a 2 year period. M(2) had a maximum in the nucleus and minima in the two cortexes. M(1) exhibited minimal value in the nucleus and maxima at the two cortexes. The positional dependence of T(2) relaxation times as well as that of M(2) indicated that they represent the behavior of the bound water in the lens. The positional dependence of M(1) suggests that this relaxat…
7056989	Dark adaptation and aging.	aging	1982-01-??	The literature relating aging and dark adaptation is discussed. The final threshold shows a significant rise in the increase in age which is more marked above the age of 60. The effects of stimulus hue (color), miosis, and the changes in the transmittance of the ocular media are explored as causes of the threshold rise. When the data are corrected for all of these effects, a threshold rise of about 0.5 log units remains which may be due to the interference in metabolism and to changes in the neural system.
20638461	Cumulative lead exposure and age-related hearing loss: the VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2010-10-01	Although lead has been associated with hearing loss in occupational settings and in children, little epidemiologic research has been conducted on the impact of cumulative lead exposure on age-related hearing loss in the general population. We determined whether bone lead levels, a marker of cumulative lead exposure, are associated with decreased hearing ability in 448 men from the Normative Aging Study, seen between 1962 and 1996 (2264 total observations). Air conduction hearing thresholds were measured at 0.25-8 kHz and pure-tone averages (PTA) (mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz) were computed. Tibia and patella lead levels were measured using K X-ray fluorescence between 1991 and 1996. In cross-sectional analyses, after adjusting for potential confounders including occupational noise, patella lead levels were significantly associated with poorer hearing thresholds at 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz and PTA. The odds of hearing loss significantly increased with patella lead levels. We also found signi…
30805890	H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes the aging process of melanogenesis through modulation of MITF and Nrf2.	aging	2019-04-??	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of HO on the aging of melanogenesis in human melanocytes. The staining of SA-β-galactosidase, an aging marker, was remarkably increased in the cells aged with HO at 62.5 µM or more compared with young cells. The intracellular HO level and melanin synthesis were also reduced in both HO-treated cells and senescent cells compared with young cells in DCFH-DA assay. Both the senescent cells and the HO-treated cells showed higher expression level of Catalase than young cells in western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the expression levels of TRP-1, TRP-2 and p300 were reduced in both senescent cells and the HO-treated cells, but that of SIRT-1 was inverted compared with young cells. In addition, HO reduced the expression level of MITF but increased that of Nrf2 in nucleus. Those results indicate that the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes in senescent cells and HO-treated cell are upregulated, but the expression …
7981003	Plasma zinc response to a breakfast meal or fasting in elderly women.	aging	1994-08-??	The aim of this study was to determine whether the postprandial decline in plasma zinc concentration is altered by aging. Eleven women, between the ages of 65 and 82 yr, participated in two separate experimental protocols: a high carbohydrate breakfast trial and a fasting trial. Plasma zinc concentrations were measured from blood samples obtained at 8:00 AM (baseline fasting) and at 30-min intervals until 1:00 PM during each trial. Following the breakfast meal, plasma zinc concentrations declined 14% from 75 +/- 1 to 65 +/- 2 micrograms/dL (p < 0.05), reaching a nadir 2.7 +/- 0.2 h after the meal. This decline was significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than the 3.6% fall observed during the fasting trial. Postprandial changes in the plasma zinc concentrations were correlated with postprandial changes in serum glucose (r = -0.43, p < 0.001), serum insulin (r = -0.17, p < 0.01), and serum phosphorus (r = 0.32, p < 0.005). These data show that plasma zinc concentrations decline following food…
1834956	Gonadotropin secretion during aging in postmenopausal women.	aging	1991-09-??	Although chronological aging is known to result in reduced gonadotropin secretion in women, the precise mechanisms to account for this neuroendocrine manifestation are yet obscure. To evaluate the extent to which the pituitary and/or hypothalamus are involved in the process of aging, we aimed at characterizing the unstimulated and GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion in postmenopausal women (PMW) of different ages. Accordingly, 9 younger PMW (mean age: 53.8 years) in their first and 9 older PMW (mean age: 80.3 years) in their 4th decade of life after natural onset of menopause were studied. In both groups, blood was collected at 10-min intervals for 10 h, while GnRH (25 micrograms i.v.) was administered 8 h after initiation of blood samplings. Compared to younger PMW, basal serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate were lower (p less than 0.05) in older PMW, while estrogen (estradiol, estrone), androgen (testosterone, androstendione) and sex hormone binding globulin leve…
16685059	Unbalanced serum leptin and ghrelin dynamics prolong postprandial satiety and inhibit hunger in healthy elderly: another reason for the "anorexia of aging".	aging	2006-05-??	BACKGROUND: In healthy elderly, a reduction from the appetite and food intake of younger years has been defined as the "anorexia of aging," which may cause malnutrition. Leptin and ghrelin may alter the control of hunger and satiety and thus lead to anorexia.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how aging affects serum leptin and ghrelin concentrations in response to a meal and the relation of those hormones to hunger and satiety sensations.    DESIGN: We studied 8 community-dwelling elderly (x +/- SD age: 78 +/- 1 y) subjects and 8 younger (29.5 +/- 1 y) control subjects. Under fasting conditions and for 4 h after an 800-kcal mixed meal, satiety and hunger were evaluated at intervals, by using a visual analogic scale. Blood samples for leptin, ghrelin, and insulin measurements were collected at the following times: 30 min before and immediately and 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the meal.    RESULTS: Postprandial satiety lasted significantly longer in the elderly tha…
17148559	The relative contributions of aging, health, and lifestyle factors to serum testosterone decline in men.	aging	2007-02-??	CONTEXT: Although it is known that serum testosterone (T) concentrations decline with age, the relative contributions of changes in health and lifestyle to that decline have not been adequately assessed.    OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to establish the relative importance of aging, health, and lifestyle in contributing to male T decline.    DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of health and endocrine functioning in randomly selected men with a baseline visit (T1, 1987-1989) and two follow-up visits (T2, 1995-1997; T3, 2002-2004) was conducted.    SETTING: An observational study of men residing in greater Boston, Massachusetts, was conducted.    PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 1667 men aged 40 to 70 at baseline; follow-up was conducted on 947 (57%) and 584 (35%) at T2 and T3, respectively.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included total serum T, calculated free T (FT), and SHBG.    RESULTS: There were substantial declines in total serum T and FT levels ass…
7507567	Correlation between senescence and DNA repair in cells from young and old individuals and in premature aging syndromes.	lifespan, aging	1994-02-??	Cellular aging appears to be related to and perhaps caused by diminished DNA repair. To elucidate direct correlations between DNA repair capacity and senescence various parameters of cellular aging and DNA repair were studied simultaneously. Of special interest are features of DNA repair and senescence in cultured diploid fibroblasts derived either from healthy young or elderly probands as well as from patients suffering from premature senescence syndromes (Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia and Down syndrome). Here we demonstrate the striking parallelism between reduced maximal lifespan, elevated levels of spontaneous chromosomal breaks, higher incidence of formation of micronuclei, a significant prolongation of cell cycle duration and a diminished reactivation of in vitro injured plasmid after transfection in cells from old individuals and from patients with premature senescence syndromes, suggesting a causal relationship between senescence and DNA damage.
12573813	Androgens and aging men.	aging	2002-12-30	This article underlines the hormonal and clinical events characterizing the so-called andropause, as they may be described from an extensive review of the literature and some data obtained with the French colleagues of the author. Evidence-based hormonal intervention has to be positioned against anti-aging entrepreneurs who peddle hormones at random. The desequilibrium in aging men between the unchanged level of plasma cortisol and the profound decrease of androgens deserves cautious studies to eventually oppose this unbalanced hormonal situation effectively and safely.
18840639	Increased estrogen rather than decreased androgen action is associated with longer androgen receptor CAG repeats.	aging	2009-01-??	CONTEXT: The individual variability in the waning androgenic-anabolic functions of aging men may be influenced by the CAG repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR), affecting androgen sensitivity. However, findings on its phenotypic effects are inconclusive.    OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the relationships between health status, various reproductive hormones, and the AR CAG repeat length.    DESIGN: We conducted a multinational prospective cohort observational study with cross-sectional baseline data.    SETTING: This was a population survey of community-dwelling men.    PARTICIPANTS: Men (40-79 yr old; n = 3369) were randomly recruited from centers in eight European countries; CAG repeat analysis was performed in 2878 men.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the correlations of the CAG repeat length with selected endocrine, metabolic, and phenotypic parameters related to aging and sex hormone action.    RESULTS: Only minor differences were found in CAG re…
21617930	The contribution of mitochondrial function to reproductive aging.	aging	2011-09-??	PURPOSE: The number of women attempting to conceive between the ages of 36 and 44 has increased significantly in the last decade. While it is well established that women's reproductive success dramatically declines with age, the underlying physiological changes responsible for this phenomenon are not well understood. With assisted reproductive technologies, it is clear that oocyte quality is a likely cause since women over 40 undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with oocytes donated by younger women have success rates comparable to young patients. Apart from oocyte donation, there is no known intervention to improve the pregnancy outcome of older patients. The aim of this paper was the review the relevant data on the potential role of mitochondria in reproductive aging.    METHOD: Review of current literature on the subject.    RESULTS: We present the current evidence that associate mitochondrial dysfunction with age related decrease in female reproductive outcome.    CONCLUSIONS: T…
33563	Age-dependent structural changes in human neuronal chromatin.	aging	1978-12-??	After partial digestion with micrococcal nuclease, DNA was extracted from nuclei of cerebral cortex neurons from young (23--36 y.) and old (78--85 y.) humans. The DNA fragments were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and their base-pair content determined. The nucleosomal DNA repeat length was found to increase from 170 (+/- 18) base-pairs in the young group to 199 (+/- 8) base-pairs in the old group. This increase of 29 base-pairs appears to be confined to the linker region of the nucleosomal DNA, since the core-DNA was always found to contain approx. 140 base-pairs. In addition, the amount of nuclear DNA digested by the micrococcal nuclease was observed to vary with age: after 30 min. of incubation at 37 degrees C hydrolysis of up to 80% of the nuclear DNA in the young but only up to 60% in the old neuronal nuclei was achieved. The age-dependent increase in chromosomal DNA repeat length is a direct proof of alterations in the basic chromatin structure with aging. It cannot be decided,…
18647816	Follicle stimulating hormone and its rate of change in defining menopause transition stages.	aging	2008-10-??	CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify menopause transition stages using acceleration or deceleration patterns of FSH rates of change from the late reproductive years to postmenopause.    SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study cohort of 629 women, aged 24-44 yr (in 1992/3), with 5757 annual FSH data points over a 14-yr period. DESIGN/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study was designed to relate acceleration/deceleration patterns in FSH rate of change to time to final menstrual period (FMP) and chronological age using nonparametric and piecewise regression modeling.    RESULTS: Four major FSH stages, based on rate of FSH change patterns, were identifiable in relation to the FMP. In FSH stage 1, the rate of FSH change increased modestly up to -7 yr prior to the FMP; in FSH stage 2 (-7 to -2 yr prior to FMP), there was a major acceleration in FSH rate of change. FSH stage 3 had an acute increase in FSH rate of change (-2 to +…
19105862	Do dietary patterns in older men influence change in homocysteine through folate fortification? The Normative Aging Study.	aging	2009-10-??	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the difference in B-vitamin intake and in plasma B-vitamin and homocysteine concentrations before and after folic acid fortification, in relation to dietary patterns.    DESIGN: The Normative Aging Study (NAS) is a longitudinal study on ageing. Between 1961 and 1970, 2280 male volunteers aged 21-80 years (mean 42 years) were recruited. Dietary intake data have been collected since 1987 and assessment of plasma B vitamins and homocysteine was added in 1993.    SETTING: Boston, Massachusetts, USA.    SUBJECTS: In the present study, 354 men who had completed at least one FFQ and one measurement of homocysteine, both before and after the fortification period, were included.    RESULTS: Three dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis: (i) a prudent pattern, with relatively high intakes of fruit, vegetables, low-fat milk and breakfast cereals; (ii) an unhealthy pattern, with high intakes of baked products, sweets and added fats; and (iii) a low frui…
19374267	Alterations in plasma nitric oxide during aging in humans.	aging	2009-02-??	Nitric oxide (NO) is relatively harmless, but along with superoxide radical becomes precursor of many toxic species, such as peroxy and hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite. In the present study, we determined plasma NO as a function of human age and correlated NO levels with total antioxidant capacity of the plasma. Results showed significant increase in NO level as a function of human age and plasma NO level positively correlated with total antioxidant potential. Increased NO may contribute to the development of oxidative stress during aging.
16292332	Correlations of androgen deficiency with clinical symptoms in Taiwanese males.	aging	????-??-??	The purpose of this study was to elucidate correlations between different biochemical measurements of androgen deficiency and clinical symptoms in male residents of Taiwan. An investigation of the serum biochemical markers for androgen deficiency in 650 males, including total testosterone, calculated free testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone, was conducted. Measurements of clinical symptoms were obtained using a questionnaire of the androgen deficiency in the aging male (ADAM) by St Louis University (SLQ). Correlations among the biochemical markers, correlations of the biochemical markers and age, and relationships between the biochemical markers and the SLQ were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the SLQ were determined. Bioavailable and calculated free testosterone correlated better with age than did total testosterone. Eighty percent of the men had a positive SLQ, and 20% had a negative SLQ. The percentage of positive SLQ results increased with age. No statisticall…
923881	Age-related changes in the reducible cross-links of human dermis collagen.	aging	1977-??-??	Samples of normal human dermis of different ages are reduced with tritiated sodium borohydride and changes of major reducible cross-links are compared as a function of chronological age. While lysinorleucine practically remains constant, reduced desmosine changes slightly, hydroxylysinoroleucine and dihydroxylysinonorleucine display a marked decrease with age. An unknown compound is shown to increase with aging. The data suggest a correlation between the change of aldimine cross-links and the structural and/or biochemical changes occurring with increase in age.
28643579	Religious Participation and Biological Functioning in Mexico.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Although several studies suggest that religious involvement tends to favor healthy biological functioning, most of this work has been conducted in the United States. This study explores the association between religious participation and biological functioning in Mexico.    METHOD: The data are drawn from two waves of the Mexican Health and Aging Study (2003-2012) to assess continuous and categorical biomarker specifications.    RESULTS: Across specifications, religious participation in 2003 is associated with lower levels of waist-to-hip ratio, total cholesterol, pulse rate, and overall allostatic load in 2012. Respondents who increased their participation over the study period also exhibit a concurrent reduction in pulse rate. Depending on the specification, participation is also associated with lower levels of diastolic blood pressure and C-reactive protein. Participation is generally unrelated to body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, and systolic blood pressure.    D…
26718469	Extract of Ettlia sp. YC001 Exerts Photoprotective Effects against UVB Irradiation in Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts.	aging	2016-04-28	The identification of novel reagents that exert a biological ultraviolet (UV)-protective effect in skin cells represents an important strategy for preventing UV-induced skin aging. To this end, we investigated the potential protective effects of Ettlia sp. YC001 extracts against UV-induced cellular damage in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). We generated four different extracts from Ettlia sp. YC001, and found that they exhibit low cytotoxicity in NHDFs. The ethyl acetate extract of Ettlia sp. YC001 markedly decreased UVB-induced cytotoxicity. Additionally, the ethyl acetate extract significantly inhibited the production of hydrogen peroxide-induced reactive oxygen species. Moreover, it inhibited UVB-induced thymine dimers, as confirmed by luciferase assay and thymine dimer dot-blot assay. Thus, the study findings suggest Ettlia sp. YC001 extract as a novel photoprotective reagent on UVB-induced cell dysfunctions in NHDFs.
23361392	Age-related changes in spontaneous oscillations assessed by wavelet transform of cerebral oxygenation and arterial blood pressure signals.	aging	2013-05-??	The study aims to assess the spontaneous oscillations in elderly subjects based on the wavelet transform of cerebral oxygenation (CO) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Continuous recordings of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and ABP signals were obtained from simultaneous measurements in 20 young subjects (age: 27.3 ± 7.1 years) and 15 elderly subjects (age: 70.8 ± 5.1 years) at rest. Using spectral analysis based on wavelet transform, five frequency intervals were identified (I, 0.005 to 0.02 Hz; II, 0.02 to 0.06 Hz; III, 0.06 to 0.15 Hz; IV, 0.15 to 0.40 Hz; and V, 0.40 to 2.0 Hz). The average amplitudes of the Δ[HbO2] and tissue oxygenation index in intervals I to V and the relative amplitudes in intervals IV and V were significantly lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects (P<0.05). In addition, the relative amplitudes of the ABP in interval I were significantly lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects (P=0.016). The present findings suggest the presence …
7201484	Spin label studies of human erythrocyte membranes in aging.	aging	1982-09-??	Spin-labeling studies of erythrocyte membranes from people more than 65 years of age and those less than 25 years of age have been performed. No statistically significant alteration in lipid fluidity in ghost membranes from older persons could be demonstrated. However, use of a protein-specific, covalently bound spin label demonstrated a highly significant alteration in electron spin resonance spectra of the probe in erythrocyte ghost membranes in aging, suggesting that the physical state of membrane proteins is altered in senescence. These results suggest a possible role of membrane proteins in the molecular biology of aging.
8743532	Aging abolishes the renal response to L-arginine infusion in essential hypertension.	aging	1996-06-??	A defect in the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation could contribute to the development of arterial hypertension through the facilitation of renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that aging impairs kidney function in essential hypertension through a derangement of nitric oxide-dependent renal mechanisms. To this end, we compared the renal response to an intravenous infusion of the precursor of nitric oxide synthesis, L-arginine, in young and aged essential hypertensives. In young hypertensives, L-arginine induced a significant increase in renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis and kaliuresis, without changes in filtration fraction. These effects were not observed in aged hypertensives. Neither PRA nor PA were affected by L-arginine infusion in any group. These results indicate that aging produces a derangement of endothelial function in essential hypertension.
9057814	Structural and functional implications of age-related abnormal modifications in collagen II from intervertebral disc.	aging	1995-10-??	Collagen II was isolated from annulus fibrosus of human donors, and the degree of enzymatic glycosylation and the extent of nonenzymatic modification was determined as a function of age. While enzymatic glycosylation did not alter with age, the fluorescence as a measure of nonenzymatic modification increased, in particular in those fractions containing highly cross-linked collagen molecules. The age-dependent increase of fluorescence was associated with a lower thermal stability of collagen II, being lowest (Tm = 36.9 degrees C instead of 42.1 degrees C) in a fraction of collagen II molecules isolated from tissue of a 69-year-old donor. In addition, collagen II from elderly donors showed an impaired propensity to form fibrils, using an in vitro assay, as evidenced by the facts that (1) more collagen molecules remained in solution and were not assembled into fibrils, and (2) the relative turbidity caused by the aggregates progressively decreased as the age of the donors increased. As se…
20828302	Load modulation of BOLD response and connectivity predicts working memory performance in younger and older adults.	aging	2011-08-??	Individual differences in working memory (WM) performance have rarely been related to individual differences in the functional responsivity of the WM brain network. By neglecting person-to-person variation, comparisons of network activity between younger and older adults using functional imaging techniques often confound differences in activity with age trends in WM performance. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the relations among WM performance, neural activity in the WM network, and adult age using a parametric letter n-back task in 30 younger adults (21-31 years) and 30 older adults (60-71 years). Individual differences in the WM network's responsivity to increasing task difficulty were related to WM performance, with a more responsive BOLD signal predicting greater WM proficiency. Furthermore, individuals with higher WM performance showed greater change in connectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left premotor cortex across load. We c…
15105581	Bioregulator Vilon-induced reactivation of chromatin in cultured lymphocytes from old people.	aging	2004-??-??	The effect of the synthetic peptide bioregulator Vilon on structural and facultative heterochromatin of cultured lymphocytes from old people has been studied. The data obtained indicate that Vilon (a) induces unrolling (deheterochromatinization) of total heterochromatin; (b) activates synthetic processes caused by the reactivation of ribosomal genes as a result of deheterochromatinization of nucleolus organizer regions; (c) releases the genes repressed due to the condensation of euchromatic regions forming facultative heterochromatin; (d) does not induce decondensation of pericentromeric structural heterochromatin. Our results indicate that Vilon causes progressive activation (deheterochromatinization) of the facultative heterochromatin with increased aging.
19765600	Functional neuroimaging of self-referential encoding with age.	aging	2010-01-??	Aging impacts memory formation and the engagement of frontal and medial temporal regions. However, much of the research to date has focused on the encoding of neutral verbal and visual information. The present fMRI study investigated age differences in a social encoding task while participants made judgments about the self or another person. Although previous studies identified an intact self-reference effect with age, subserved by robust engagement of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by both young and older adults, we identified a number of age differences. In regions including superior mPFC, inferior prefrontal cortex, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, young and older adults exhibited reversals in the pattern of activity for self and other conditions. Whereas young primarily evidenced subsequent forgetting effects in the self-reference condition, older adults demonstrated subsequent memory effects in the other-reference condition. These results indicate fundamental differen…
1675857	Neurotransmitter markers in the cerebrospinal fluid of normal subjects. Effects of aging and other confounding factors.	aging	1991-??-??	We have investigated neurotransmitter-related markers of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a carefully screened series of normally aging subjects in standardized conditions in order to find out the influence of age and other confounding factors on CSF measures. The levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyglycol (MHPG) and the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) also increased with age, while homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA) and immunoreactivities of somatostatin (SLI), beta-endorphin (BLI) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were unrelated to age. The gender of subjects had no significant effect on the levels of neurotransmitter markers, while seasonal changes, as well as height and weight of the subjects seemed to cause some variations in the levels of HVA, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and ACTH. The study underscores the importance of standardized conditions and matched patient groups in the CSF studies.
2442239	Reproductive hormones in aging men. III: Basal and LHRH-stimulated serum concentrations of the common alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones.	aging	1987-09-??	In a previous study, we described unaltered basal serum levels of sex steroids, increased basal luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and diminished and/or delayed gonadotropin responses to exogenous luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) in 69 healthy men, aged 25 to 89 years, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Here we report basal and LHRH-stimulated serum concentrations of the common alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones in 53 of these same men, divided into groups: A, 25 to 49 years, (n = 22); B, 50 to 69 years, (n = 18); and C, 70 to 89 years, (n = 13). There were no significant (p greater than .2) age-related alterations in basal serum concentrations of the alpha-subunit. Using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), we found a significant difference between basal levels and peak responses to LHRH for alpha-subunit in each group (p less than .001); however, age per se did not influence the magnitude of this response (p grea…
895211	Comparison by autoradiography of macromolecular biosynthesis in "young" and "old" human diploid fibroblast cultures. A brief note.	aging	????-??-??	The biosynthetic abilities of WI-38 fibroblasts from early and late population-doubling-level cultures were compared by autoradiography of cells grown with labeled precursors of DNA, RNA, protein and lipids. Incorporation of radioactive thymidine, uridine, protein-hydrolysate, acetate, oleic acid and cholesterol, as measured by the number of grains per cell surface, decreased with the progressive aging of the culture. However, the decrease in the incorporation of acetate, oleic acid and cholesterol was much smaller than that of the other precursors, indicating that lipid synthesis is affected to a lesser degree than protein and nucleic acid synthesis on aging. This result is in accord with the higher lipid content and proliferation of intracellular membranes in cells of "old" WI-38 cultures reported by others.
28448759	FT3 IS HIGHER IN MALES THAN IN FEMALES AND DECREASES OVER THE LIFESPAN.	lifespan	2017-07-??	OBJECTIVE: Normal changes in free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels over the lifespan and differences between sexes are not well documented, mainly because even the largest-scale studies available include relatively small cohorts. The aim of this study was to define age-related trends including sex differences based on reliable data.    METHODS: A large database including serum thyroid tests drawn in community clinics was studied. FT3, FT4, and TSH levels from 527,564 sera samples taken from patients age 1 year or greater were included. After highly extensive exclusion criteria applied to remove all samples that may have been taken from unhealthy people, 27,940 samples remained. These were stratified by decades of age and by sex.    RESULTS: FT3 decreases throughout life, significantly more so among females, with equalization between sexes with greater age. FT4 declines to a lesser extent, also more among females than among males…
20138255	Simulating neurocognitive aging: effects of a dopaminergic antagonist on brain activity during working memory.	aging	2010-03-15	BACKGROUND: Previous correlational studies have indirectly linked dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission to age-related cognitive deficits and associated reductions in task-induced functional brain activity.    METHODS: We used an experimental-pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach to more directly examine the role of dopamine in neurocognitive aging. Twenty younger and 20 healthy older adults were included. During fMRI scanning, a spatial working memory (SWM) task was administered under two conditions, varying in cognitive load. Positron emission tomography measurements with the D1 receptor antagonist [(11)C]SCH23390 confirmed that a given experimental dose of unlabeled solution occupied 50% of D1 receptors in younger adults.    RESULTS: An age-related reduction in SWM performance was observed, and fMRI data revealed that, relative to younger adults under placebo conditions, elderly persons under-recruited load-sensitive fronto-parietal regions dur…
19244547	The use of dried blood spot sampling in the national social life, health, and aging project.	aging	2009-11-??	OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the methods used for and issues associated with collection and analysis of dried blood spot (DBS) samples for the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project and provides the basic distributions of the resulting analytes.    METHODS: DBSs from capillary finger sticks were collected by nonmedically trained interviewers from 2,044 individuals, aged 57-85 years. The quality and quantity of DBS samples were evaluated to allow for analysis of interviewer performance. Levels of C-reactive protein, antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus, hemoglobin, and glycosylated hemoglobin were assayed using various analytic methods.    RESULTS: Cooperation rate for DBS collection was 84.5%, with 99% of the cards yielding enough sample for at least one analysis. The distribution, mean, and standard deviation of the analytes obtained from DBSs are also presented in this paper.    CONCLUSIONS: The high cooperation rate and quality of the spots collected suggest that the co…
2993763	Glycogen accumulation of the aging human brain.	aging	1985-06-??	We describe light- and electron-microscopically a new type of intracytoplasmatic inclusions within cell processes of the cerebral cortex and the underlying white matter. These structures measure 5-50 micron in diameter and consist almost exclusively of densely packed alpha- or beta-glycogen granules, which never occur together in any single structure. Within their periphery, electron-dense amorphous spots and cell organelles, especially mitochondria, were seen. No membrane-bound glycogen was observed. We propose to call them granular glycogen bodies. They occur in 4 of 7 examined postmortem specimens of the cerebral cortex of people older than 60 years of age. They were not found in 4 younger controls aged 26-48. Their appearance may reflect a distinct turnover disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, which becomes manifest under diverse pathologic conditions and in the normal aging process.
10531063	Aging-dependent large accumulation of point mutations in the human mtDNA control region for replication.	aging	1999-10-22	Progressive damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during life is thought to contribute to aging processes. However, this idea has been difficult to reconcile with the small fraction of mtDNA so far found to be altered. Here, examination of mtDNA revealed high copy point mutations at specific positions in the control region for replication of human fibroblast mtDNA from normal old, but not young, individuals. Furthermore, in longitudinal studies, one or more mutations appeared in an individual only at an advanced age. Some mutations appeared in more than one individual. Most strikingly, a T414G transversion was found, in a generally high proportion (up to 50 percent) of mtDNA molecules, in 8 of 14 individuals above 65 years of age (57 percent) but was absent in 13 younger individuals.
11120762	Relative contributions of testosterone and estrogen in regulating bone resorption and formation in normal elderly men.	aging	2000-12-??	Young adult males who cannot produce or respond to estrogen (E) are osteopenic, suggesting that E may regulate bone turnover in men, as well as in women. Both bioavailable E and testosterone (T) decrease substantially in aging men, but it is unclear which deficiency is the more important factor contributing to the increased bone resorption and impaired bone formation that leads to their bone loss. Thus, we addressed this issue directly by eliminating endogenous T and E production in 59 elderly men (mean age 68 years), studying them first under conditions of physiologic T and E replacement and then assessing the impact on bone turnover of withdrawing both T and E, withdrawing only T, or only E, or continuing both. Bone resorption markers increased significantly in the absence of both hormones and were unchanged in men receiving both hormones. By two-factor ANOVA, E played the major role in preventing the increase in the bone resorption markers, whereas T had no significant effect. By co…
939429	Aging of human bone and articular cartilage collagen: changes in the reducible cross-links and their precursors.	aging	1976-??-??	The age-dependent changes in reducible collagen cross-links, Schiff bases and their precursors were followed for human bone and articular cartilage throughout the whole life span from 3 to 89 years of age. With aging, the reduced Schiff bases dihydroxylysinonorleucine remarkable decreased, wheras hexitollysine peaks increased significantly in both collagens. Dihydroxynorleucine, the precursor of the cross-link, was found to increase slightly with age. But the changes in hydroxylysinonorleucine and lysinonorleucine were comparatively small. These changes were discussed in relation to the increased insolubility observed in both collagens at higher age.
19096122	Aging skin is functionally anaerobic: importance of coenzyme Q10 for anti aging skin care.	aging	2008-??-??	The functional loss of mitochondria represents an inherent part in modern theories trying to explain the cutaneous aging process. The present study shows significant age-dependent differences in mitochondrial function of keratinocytes isolated from skin biopsies of young and old donors. Our data let us postulate that energy metabolism shifts to a predominantly non-mitochondrial pathway and is therefore functionally anaerobic with advancing age. CoQ10 positively influences the age-affected cellular metabolism and enables to combat signs of aging starting at the cellular level. As a consequence topical application of CoQ10 is beneficial for human skin as it rapidly improves mitochondrial function in skin in vivo.
8804091	Excessive apoptosis of mature T lymphocytes is a characteristic feature of human immune senescence.	aging	1996-07-05	Recent evidence suggests that apoptotic deletion of activated mature lymphocytes is an essential physiological process implicated in both the regulation of the immune response and the control of the overall number of immunocompetent cells. Tightly interrelated signaling mechanisms convey either activation or death messages, achieving the necessary equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell deletion. During the course of aging, numerous alterations of these signaling pathways may shift the balance toward cell death. In the present investigation, the reduced DNA synthesis of anti-CD3 activated T lymphocytes isolated from elderly individuals is associated with an important and early cell deletion from the cultures. Visualization of DNA fragmentation in the remaining activated cells argues in favour of the apoptotic nature of the cell deletion. Quantification of histone-associated DNA fragments shows that the apoptotic process is greatly amplified in activated lymphocytes derived from…
3944197	Proteoglycans synthesized by gingival fibroblasts derived from human donors of different ages.	aging	1986-01-??	The proteoglycans synthesized by fibroblasts derived from human donors of ages ranging from 12 years to 68 years have been studied. In addition, the in vitro proliferation rates of the various cell strains were studied and demonstrated that increasing donor age correlated with a decrease in proliferative activity. The incorporation of [35S]-sulfate into proteoglycans decreased with increasing donor age with cells from the oldest donor demonstrating a 50% reduction compared with cells from the youngest donor. Analysis on Sepharose CL-4B of isolated [35S]-labeled proteoglycans for molecular size distribution revealed few differences between the cell-layer-associated proteoglycans of all cell strains studied. However, analysis of the medium-associated [35S]-labeled proteoglycans demonstrated an increase in the amount of small molecular size proteoglycans with increasing age. More specific analysis of the glycosaminoglycan composition revealed an increase in heparan sulfate from 52% to 73%…
19667063	Decreased TNF-alpha synthesis by macrophages restricts cutaneous immunosurveillance by memory CD4+ T cells during aging.	aging	2009-08-31	Immunity declines during aging, however the mechanisms involved in this decline are not known. In this study, we show that cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to recall antigens are significantly decreased in older individuals. However, this is not related to CC chemokine receptor 4, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, or CD11a expression by CD4(+) T cells or their physical capacity for migration. Instead, there is defective activation of dermal blood vessels in older subject that results from decreased TNF-alpha secretion by macrophages. This prevents memory T cell entry into the skin after antigen challenge. However, isolated cutaneous macrophages from these subjects can be induced to secrete TNF-alpha after stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 or TLR 4 ligands in vitro, indicating that the defect is reversible. The decreased conditioning of tissue microenvironments by macrophage-derived cytokines may therefore lead to defective immunosurveillance by…
21231990	Are there symptom-specific testosterone thresholds in aging men?	aging	2011-10-??	OBJECTIVE: • To study the association between specific clinical symptoms (e.g. low libido and erectile dysfunction) and testosterone levels and age in order to define symptom-specific testosterone thresholds.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: • Serum samples for testosterone determination were obtained from 675 healthy men. • Participants underwent urological examination and completed the Aging Males Symptoms scale, the Beck Depression Index and the International Index of Erectile Function. Overall scores and those from individual questions from the questionnaires were evaluated. • Testosterone levels in men with symptoms were compared with those in men without symptoms. • The risks of clinical symptoms were evaluated using univariate, multiple multinomial regression analyses and Bonferroni correction.    RESULTS: • Significant associations between testosterone levels and a number of androgen deficiency symptoms were seen at testosterone levels of 13.5-14.4 nmol/L, but multiple logistic regres…
20643012	Magnetic resonance imaging illustrating change in the Ostmann fat pad with age.	aging	2010-08-??	A retrospective analysis of 35 skull base patients with no history of eustachian tube dysfunction who had magnetic resonance imaging at our institution between 2006 and 2007 was conducted. The fat pad of Ostmann surface area, the eustachian tube medial cartilage, and the tensor veli palatini muscle surface area were measured in all scans. The change in anatomic structures with age was compared and showed no parameter changes except for the Ostmann fat pad, which decreased in size with age (correlation coefficient = 0.0629). There was no statistical significance between males and females in all parameters.
8083650	Effect of age on serum immunoglobulin G subclass antibody responses to inactivated influenza virus vaccine.	aging	1994-05-??	We previously reported an age-associated impairment of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses to inactivated influenza virus vaccine. The present study extends these observations by examining the IgG subclass distribution of vaccine responses measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in healthy adults aged < 40 (young), 40-64 (middle-aged), and > or = 65 (elderly) years. Serological responses in all age groups showed antibodies that were predominantly IgG1 and secondarily IgG3. Influenza antigen-specific IgG4 titers did not change following vaccination, and antibodies of the IgG2 subclass were not detected in any serum specimens. Aging was associated with a significant impairment of IgG1, but not of IgG3, antibody production. Relative differences in the magnitude and frequency of response between IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, which were present in young and middle-aged adults (viz., IgG1 > IgG3), were less apparent in the elderly. This observation was confirmed in a second ana…
8328939	Age-dependent change in the hyaluronic acid content of the human chorioretinal complex.	aging	1993-07-??	OBJECTIVE: Hyaluronic acid (HA) has a key role in the structure and organization of the extracellular matrix. We sought to identify the distribution of HA in human eye tissue with regard to age using a biotinylated HA-binding protein.    METHODS: Fetal and adult (from donors ranging from 28 to 94 years of age) eye tissues were fixed less than 24 hours post mortem and embedded in JB-4 medium (Polysciences, Warrington, Pa). Sections of 2-microns thickness were used. Control sections were pretreated either with Streptomyces hyaluronidase or HA-binding protein inactivated by HA. The binding of the protein to HA was detected with avidinbiotin alkaline phosphatase and developed by incubation with naphthol as-mx phosphate and Texas Red Salt (Pierce, Rockford, Ill).    RESULTS: Specific staining for HA was observed in fetal eyes in the choroid, Bruch's membrane, sclera, retinal pigment epithelium, and developing retina from the vitreoretinal interface to the inner plexiform layer. Specific sta…
11513313	Testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and insulin in sedentary and physically trained aged men.	aging	2001-07-??	The influence of physical activity on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total and free testosterone (TT and FT, respectively), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin concentrations in aging men was investigated. Eight trained and nine sedentary men aged 60-65 years volunteered to participate in this study. Physical activity was determined during an effort test and evaluated by the measure of the maximal aerobic power (W(aer,max)). In the trained aging men, the W(aer,max) was higher than in the sedentary group of matching age [mean (SD) 206.8 (17.1) W versus 136.6 (12.3) W; P<0.0001]. The fat percentage was higher in the sedentary (n = 9) than in the trained (n = 8) group [23.9 (3.2)% versus 14.6 (3.7)%; P<0.0001]. DHEAS and IGF-1 levels were higher in trained than in sedentary subjects, respectively 2.04 (1) micromol/l versus 1.01 (0.68) micromol/l (P=0.02) and 192.1 (40.1) ng/ml versus 132.8 (31.2) ng/ml (P=…
21388496	Differential influence of peripheral and systemic sex steroids on skeletal muscle quality in pre- and postmenopausal women.	aging	2011-08-??	Aging is associated with gradual decline of skeletal muscle strength and mass often leading to diminished muscle quality. This phenomenon is known as sarcopenia and affects about 30% of the over 60-year-old population. Androgens act as anabolic agents regulating muscle mass and improving muscle performance. The role of female sex steroids as well as the ability of skeletal muscle tissue to locally produce sex steroids has been less extensively studied. We show that despite the extensive systemic deficit of sex steroid hormones in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women, the hormone content of skeletal muscle does not follow the same trend. In contrast to the systemic levels, muscle tissue of post- and premenopausal women had similar concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, while the concentrations of estradiol and testosterone were significantly higher in muscle of the postmenopausal women. The presence of steroidogenetic enzymes in muscle tissue indicates t…
12911137	Circadian organization of serum electrolytes in physiological aging.	aging	????-??-??	Age-related structural and neurochemical changes occurring in the central nervous system have been related to changes in some rhythmometric parameters. In spite of their clinical importance, only a few studies have investigated the modifications over time of serum electrolytes in senescence. The aim of our study was to evaluate the circadian pattern of serum potassium, chloride, sodium, calcium and phosphorus in 30 clinically healthy elderly subjects, with no cognitive impairment, and to compare the findings with those given by 24 healthy young controls. The subjects were synchronized as regards their daily activities, sleeping/waking habits, time/quality of meals and dietary electrolyte intake. After an overnight fast, samples were taken beginning at 08.00 and every 4 h thereafter until 20.00, and every 2 h from 20.00 to 04.00. Both the young and the elderly subjects exhibited statistically significant circadian rhythms for all serum electrolytes considered. Our findings suggest that …
3000834	Physiological and molecular correlates of age-related changes in the human beta-adrenergic receptor system.	aging	1986-01-??	Aging decreases hormone responsiveness in several receptor systems. In this article I consider both physiological and biochemical studies supporting the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor responsiveness is reduced with aging in humans. Reduced chronotropic and vasodilator responses to the beta-receptor agonists isoproterenol and metaproterenol have been demonstrated. In human leukocytes a reduction in adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity occurs with aging. More recently it has been suggested that this reduction in beta-adrenergic responsiveness with aging may be caused by an uncoupling of the beta receptor from the catalytic component.
17710730	Neuroendocrine changes with reproductive aging in women.	aging	2007-09-??	Aging has dramatic effects on the reproductive system in women. Undoubtedly, the most notable changes in the neuroendocrine axis arise from the loss of ovarian function, and thus, the loss of negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary. Progressive decreases in inhibin B and inhibin A result in an early increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which initially maintains folliculogenesis and estradiol secretion. Over time, regular ovulatory cycles give way to inconsistent folliculogenesis and ovulation, dramatic swings in estradiol and gonadotropin levels, and markedly irregular cycles. Changes in estrogen positive feedback may contribute to cycle disruption. Studies in younger and older postmenopausal women indicate that changes in the neuroendocrine axis occur with aging that are independent of the changing ovarian hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition. Luteinizing hormone and FSH decrease progressively after the menopause, as does gonadotropin-releasing hormone (…
12392837	Age-dependent changes of cardiac neuronal noradrenaline reuptake transporter (uptake1) in the human heart.	aging	2002-10-16	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the neuronal noradrenaline reuptake transporter (uptake1) undergoes age-dependent regulation in the human heart.    BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with various alterations in cardiovascular function.    METHODS: We determined uptake1 density (by [3H]-nisoxetine binding to membranes) and activity (by accumulation of [3H]-noradrenaline into tissue slices) in the right atria (RA) of 42 patients (age range 3 months to 76 years) undergoing open-heart surgery without apparent heart failure. Moreover, the effects of 1 micromol/l desipramine on the noradrenaline-induced positive inotropic effect were assessed in the isolated, electrically driven RA trabeculae of these patients.    RESULTS: There was a significant negative correlation between RA uptake1 density and age; moreover, RA uptake1 activity was significantly reduced in elderly patients. Desipramine (1 micromol/l) significantly shifted noradrenaline concentration-response c…
19465031	Wavelet analysis of sacral skin blood flow oscillations to assess soft tissue viability in older adults.	aging	2009-09-??	The objective of this study was to investigate age-related changes of microvascular functions using wavelet analysis of blood flow oscillations (BFO), and to develop a new quantification method to present wavelet coefficients for studying the contribution of each blood flow control mechanism to the skin vasodilatory response. 20 older people between 65 and 85 years of age were recruited into the study. The heater temperature at the sacral skin was raised to 42 degrees C in 2 min and maintained at that temperature for the duration of the 50 minute heating period to induce a biphasic vasodilatory response: axon reflex mediated and nitric oxide mediated vasodilation. Wavelet-based spectrum analysis was used to calculate sacral skin blood flow and frequency bands including metabolic (0.008-0.02 Hz), neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz), myogenic (0.05-0.15 Hz), respiratory (0.15-0.4 Hz), and cardiac (0.4-2.0 Hz) frequencies. Biphasic Thermal Index is defined as ratios of first peak, nadir, and second…
17084021	Carbohydrate complexity and proportions of serum FSH isoforms in the male: lectin-based studies.	aging	2007-01-02	FSH is synthesized and secreted in multiple molecular forms with different oligosaccharide structures which are needed for full expression of biological activity. GnRH and sex steroids modulate oligosaccharide structure and composition. In the present study we have assessed the carbohydrate complexity and proportion of circulating FSH isoforms during puberty, aging and after androgen administration to pubertal anorchid boys. Preparative isoelectrofocusing and lectin chromatography were used to isolate FSH isoforms on the basis of charge and internal carbohydrate complexity. Differences in sialic acid content and a progressive increase of isoforms bearing highly branched oligosaccharides were found during puberty. Less acidic, more bioactive FSH isoforms, secreted at mid-puberty may modulate important maturational events in the Sertoli cell population. Androgen administration to pubertal anorchid boys favoured the secretion of this type of isoforms. In adult men, the predominance of FSH…
29716762	Plasma zinc in institutionalized elderly individuals: Relation with immune and cardiometabolic biomarkers.	aging	2018-12-??	Changes in zinc metabolism caused by aging and the institutionalization process may contribute to zinc deficiency in elderly individuals. Hypozincemia results in changes in glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma zinc concentrations and their relationships with sociodemographic, dietary, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic biomarkers in institutionalized elderly individuals. A cross-sectional study was carried out including 255 elderly adults living in nursing homes. The associations between plasma zinc and dietary zinc intake, sociodemographic indicators, and glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Independent variables were analyzed according to quartiles of plasma zinc concentrations (Q1: <71.1 μg/dL; Q2: 71.1-83.3 μg/dL; Q3: <83.3-93.7 μg/dL; Q4: >93.7 μg/dL). The relationship between plasma zinc concentrations and predictor variables was also tested. In Q1, higher concentrations of the following variables were obs…
18547864	Early advancing age alters plasma glucose and glucoregulatory hormones in response to supramaximal exercise.	aging	2009-11-??	After the age of 60, the decrease in physical activity and the increase in fat mass (FM) are two essential factors contributing to the alteration of glucose, insulin, and catecholamines responses induced by exercise. To discard these two factors, we compared the glucoregulatory responses in three different groups of men between the ages 21 and 34, and matched pairs: trained groups (T34 and T21) were matched for training level; T21 and U21 (U for untrained) were matched for age; T34 and U21 were matched for FM. The glucoregulatory responses were determined by venous plasma concentrations of glucose ([GLU]), insulin ([INS]), and catecholamines (adrenaline: [A], noradrenaline: [NA]) before and after a Wingate test. [GLU], [INS], and [A] did not differ between T21 and U21, indicating that high-level training had no effects on these parameters. On the other hand, T34 compared to T21 and U21, had higher GLU associated with lower INS post-exercise concentrations. Moreover, [A(max)] was signif…
20407287	Decrease in asymmetrical dimethylarginine, an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, in cerebrospinal fluid during elderly aging and in patients with sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	aging	2010-??-??	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been implicated in nervous system aging and the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effect of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) was previously unknown.    OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the significance of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neuronal death during elderly aging and in ALS. To do so, the concentration of ADMA, an endogenous NO synthase inhibitor in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), was determined in neurologically normal controls and in patients with ALS.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 20 untreated patients with ALS (M/F, 12/8) and 20 age-matched controls (M/F, 9/11), with a mean age (±SD) of 66.9 ± 9.2 years for patients and 65.1 ± 13.9 years for controls. The concentrations of ADMA and L-arginine (Arg) in the CSF of ALS patients were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detector. Control subjects were neurologically normal patient…
16670164	The relationship between libido and testosterone levels in aging men.	aging	2006-07-??	CONTEXT: Although it is known that serum testosterone (T) concentrations are related to libido, the strength of that relationship in community-dwelling men has not yet been determined.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the strength and significance of the association between aging men's self-reports of libido and serum T concentrations.    DESIGN: Our study was a community-based evaluation of men's health and aging, including three data collection waves: baseline (T1, 1987-1989) and follow-ups (T2, 1995-1997; T3, 2002-2004). Libido was measured on a 14-point scale assessing self-reported frequency of desire and thoughts/fantasies; low libido was defined as a score of less than 7 of 14.    SETTING: We conducted an epidemiological study in greater Boston, Massachusetts.    PARTICIPANTS: There were 1632 men aged 40-70 yr at baseline, with follow-up on 922 (56%) at 9 yr (T2) and 623 (38%) at 15 yr (T3).    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed total and calculated bioavailable T .    …
28465725	Differential DNA methylation and lymphocyte proportions in a Costa Rican high longevity region.	longevity, aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: The Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica has one of the highest old-age life expectancies in the world, but the underlying biological mechanisms of this longevity are not well understood. As DNA methylation is hypothesized to be a component of biological aging, we focused on this malleable epigenetic mark to determine its association with current residence in Nicoya versus elsewhere in Costa Rica. Examining a population's unique DNA methylation pattern allows us to differentiate hallmarks of longevity from individual stochastic variation. These differences may be characteristic of a combination of social, biological, and environmental contexts.    METHODS: In a cross-sectional subsample of the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study, we compared whole blood DNA methylation profiles of residents from Nicoya ( = 48) and non-Nicoya (other Costa Rican regions,  = 47) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray.    RESULTS: We observed a number of differences that may be m…
21349336	EEG-BOLD correlations during (post-)adolescent brain maturation.	lifespan	2011-06-01	The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical stage in the human lifespan during which the brain still undergoes substantial structural and functional change. The changing frequency composition of the resting state EEG reflects maturation of brain function. This study investigated (post)adolescent brain maturation captured by two independently but simultaneously recorded neuronal signals: EEG and fMRI. Data were collected in a 20 min eyes-open/eyes-closed resting state paradigm. EEG, fMRI-BOLD signal and EEG-BOLD correlations were compared between groups of adults, age 25 (n=18), and adolescents, age 15 (n=18). A typical developmental decrease of low-frequency EEG power was observed even at this late stage of brain maturation. Frequency and condition specific EEG-fMRI correlations proved robust for multiple brain regions. However, no consistent change in the EEG-BOLD correlations was identified that would correspond to the neuronal maturation captured by the EEG. This resu…
24524911	Neural correlates of a standardized version of the trail making test in young and elderly adults: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.	aging	2014-04-??	The trail making test (TMT) is a widely applied diagnostic tool measuring executive functioning in order to discriminate between healthy and pathological aging processes. However, due to its paper-and-pencil nature it is difficult to adapt for functional brain imaging. Related neural underpinnings even in healthy aging are mostly unknown since no consistent administration for imaging is available. In this study a standardized implementation of the TMT for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is proposed to investigate associated frontal cortex activation in healthy young (mean age 25.7 ± 3.02 years) and elderly adults (mean age 70.95 ± 3.55 years). The TMT consisted of a number condition (TMT-A), an alternating number and letter condition (TMT-B) as well as a control task. Behavioral results demonstrated that elderly participants performed slower but committed a similar number of errors compared to younger adults. The fNIRS results showed that particularly the TMT-B provoked b…
21625174	Aging is associated with a proapoptotic endothelial progenitor cell phenotype.	aging	2011-??-??	The aim of this study was to determine if aging is associated with enhanced endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) sensitivity to apoptosis. Cells with phenotypic EPC characteristics were isolated from healthy, nonobese young (age 25 ± 1 years) and older (61 ± 1 years) men. Intracellular active caspase-3 concentrations in response to staurosporine stimulation were approximately 35% higher (p < 0.05) in EPCs from older (3.15 ± 0.29 pg/ml) compared with young (2.33 ± 0.24 pg/ml) men. Protein expression of Akt, p70 S6-kinase and Bcl-2 was markedly lower (approx. 35, 75 and 60%, respectively, all p < 0.05) in EPCs from older compared with young men, whereas there were no age-related differences in either 14-3-3ε or Bax expression. Additionally, EPC telomerase activity was 57% lower (p < 0.05) in older (0.18 ± 0.11 AU) versus young (0.43 ± 0.11 AU) men. These results indicate that aging is associated with a proapoptotic EPC phenotype characterized by decreased expression of key antiapoptotic pro…
28110151	Selection of an optimal set of biomarkers and comparative analyses of biological age estimation models in Korean females.	aging	????-??-??	To date, an optimal working model which predicts biological age (BA) with a set of working biomarkers has not been devised to represent the Korean female population. Accuracy of prediction and applicability are required of an optimal set of commonly assessed biomarkers to provide information on the health status. The goal of this study was to identify a set of biomarkers that represent the aging process and to develop and compare different BA prediction models to elucidate the most fitting and applicable model for providing information on health status in the Korean female population. Using a series of selection processes, eight clinically assessable variables were selected by analyzing relations between 31 clinical variables and chronologic age in 912 normal, healthy individuals among 3642 female participants with ages ranging from 30 to 80 years. The multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component analysis (PCA), and the Klemera-Doubal (KDM) statistical methods were applied to …
22341880	Executive summary of the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging.	aging	2012-04-??	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to summarize the recommended updates to the 2001 Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria. The 2011 STRAW + 10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period.    METHOD(S): Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antimüllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus.    RESULT(S): STRAW + 10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage -3) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late …
22983440	Low circulating IGF-I bioactivity is associated with human longevity: findings in centenarians' offspring.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2012-09-??	UNLABELLED: Centenarians' offspring represent a suitable model to study age-dependent variables (e.g. IGF-I) potentially involved in the modulation of the lifespan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the IGF-I in human longevity. We evaluated circulating IGF-I bioactivity measured by an innovative IGF-I Kinase Receptor Activation (KIRA) Assay, total IGF-I, IGFBP-3, total IGF-II, insulin, glucose, HOMA2-B% and HOMA2-S% in 192 centenarians' offspring and 80 offspring-controls of which both parents died relatively young. Both groups were well-matched for age, gender and BMI with the centenarians' offspring. IGF-I bioactivity (p〈0.01), total IGF-I (p〈0.01) and the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio (p〈0.001) were significantly lower in centenarians' offspring compared to offspring matched-controls. Serum insulin, glucose, HOMA2-B% and HOMA2-S% values were similar between both groups. In centenarians' offspring IGF-I bioactivity was inversely associated to insulin sensitivit…
9720647	Functional properties of CD4+ CD28- T cells in the aging immune system.	aging	1998-05-15	The aging immune system is characterized by a progressive decline in the responsiveness to exogenous antigens and tumors in combination with a paradoxical increase in autoimmunity. From a clinical viewpoint, deficiencies in antibody responses to exogenous antigens, such as vaccines, have a major impact and may reflect intrinsic B cell defects or altered performance of helper T cells. Here we describe that aging is associated with the emergence of an unusual CD4 T cell subset characterized by the loss of CD28 expression. CD28 is the major costimulatory molecule required to complement signaling through the antigen receptor for complete T cell activation. CD4+ CD28- T cells are long-lived, typically undergo clonal expansion in vivo, and react to autoantigens in vitro. Despite the deficiency of CD28, these unusual T cells remain functionally active and produce high concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). The loss of CD28 expression is correlated with a lack…
18289881	Chronic smoking and the BOLD response to a visual activation task and a breath hold task in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.	aging	2008-04-15	Many psychiatric patient groups smoke heavily, but little is known regarding the effects of this habit on functional brain imaging results. The present report assesses the effect of chronic smoking on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a simple visual activation (VA) task and a breath hold (BH) task in patients with schizophrenia. Eight healthy controls and twelve patients with schizophrenia were studied. Half of each group had never smoked and the other half of each group had smoked for more than 10 pack years. Responses to the VA task were assessed in the visual cortex and responses to the BH task were assessed in gray matter generally. There were four fMRI-dependent measures: (1) median percent signal change; (2) activation volume (in voxels); (3) time-to-peak of the impulse response function (IRF); and (4) time-to-trough of the IRF. All measures were tested as dependent variables in an ANCOVA with diagnosis and smoking status as crossed factors and age as a covaria…
12679610	Altered plasma nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity and nerve growth factor-receptor expression in human old age.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF), discovered because of its action on cells in the peripheral and the central nervous system, is now known to act also on immune cells in developing and adult subjects. Whether peripheral lymphocytes of aged subjects are responsive to this molecule is less clear.    OBJECTIVE: Aim of our study was to investigate whether or not plasma NGF undergoes any significant changes during aging and whether or not NGF receptors on peripheral lymphocytes are affected in old subjects.    METHODS: To address these questions, we used RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoenzymatic analysis to evaluate the expression of NGF receptors in human peripheral lymphocytes and NGF-like immunoreactivity.    RESULTS: These results revealed a low amount of NGF in the plasma of old subjects associated with a reduced expression of mRNA for NGF receptor trkA in peripheral lymphocytes. They also showed elevated levels of circulating interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-…
24060006	Age differences in hippocampus-cortex connectivity during true and false memory retrieval.	aging	2013-11-??	The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated developmental differences in functional connectivity associated with true and false memory retrieval. A sample of 8- to 9-year-olds and adults (N = 31) was assessed with the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, known to induce high levels of false recognition of lures that are semantically associated with studied items. The strength of semantic association among list items was manipulated. Relative to children, adults correctly recognized more studied items and falsely recognized more critical lures. High-association lists resulted in higher recognition of both studied items and critical lures. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, overall, true recognition was supported by coupling within two hippocampal-temporal and fronto-parietal set of regions; in contrast, coupling among more distributed hippocampal-temporal-parietal-frontal regions was observed during false recognition. Critically, adults, …
7809561	A longitudinal study of laboratory- and diary-based sleep measures in healthy "old old" and "young old" volunteers.	aging	1994-09-??	The major aim of this study was to examine laboratory- and diary-based measures of sleep in a group of healthy ("successfully aging") "old old" subjects (> or = 75 years of age), as contrasted with a group of "young old" subjects (60-74 years of age), who were followed longitudinally for 2 years. We hypothesized that sleep would deteriorate to a greater extent over time among the old old subjects than among the young old. The study group consisted of 50 elders (21 male, 29 female; 23 old old, 27 young old), each studied at baseline and then again at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Analysis of variance was used to determine main effects of age group, gender and time on key sleep measures. Most measures were found to be remarkably stable over time. However, some decay was detected in sleep efficiency among the old old, but not among the young old. In a multiple regression model for the cohort as a whole, age, cognitive status and medical burden at baseline predicted subsequent declines in sleep…
16513832	An ensemble model of the male gonadal axis: illustrative application in aging men.	aging	2006-06-??	Testosterone (Te) production declines in the aging male, albeit for unknown reasons. Plausible mechanisms include reduced secretion of GnRH, less feedforward by LH, and/or altered feedback by systemic Te. The present study tests all three postulates in a cohort of 10 young (20-35 yr old) and eight older (50-72 yr old) men. The experimental paradigm comprised graded blockade of the GnRH receptor to create four distinct strata of LH and Te pulsatility in each subject. A novel analytical formalism was developed to reconstruct implicit dose-response functions linking 1) virtual GnRH outflow positively to LH secretion, 2) LH pulses positively to Te secretion, and 3) Te concentrations negatively to the size and number of LH secretory bursts. Validation was by direct pituitary sampling in the horse and sheep. Statistical comparisons disclosed that age decreased the efficacy of each of 1) virtual GnRH outflow (P < 0.01), 2) LH drive of Te secretion (P < 0.01), and 3) total, bioavailable and fr…
3030826	Photosynthesis of vitamin D in the skin: effect of environmental and life-style variables.	aging	1987-04-??	Exposure to sunlight continues to play a major role in providing adequate vitamin D nutrition for most of the population of the world, including those who live in countries that practice fortification of dairy, margarine, and cereal products with vitamin D. During exposure to sunlight, the high-energy UV photons (290-315 nm) penetrate the epidermis and photolyze 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) to previtamin D3. Once formed, previtamin D3 undergoes a thermally induced isomerization to vitamin D3 that takes 2-3 days to reach completion. Melanin effectively competes with provitamin D3 for the UV radiation that enters the epidermis and limits its photolysis to previtamin D3. However, this is not the major factor that prevents excess production of vitamin D in the skin of people who are constantly exposed to sunlight. During the initial exposure to sunlight, provitamin D3 is efficiently converted to previtamin D3. However, because previtamin D3 is photolabile, continued exposure to sun…
18209097	Induction of CD56 and TCR-independent activation of T cells with aging.	aging	2008-02-01	Degeneration of the thymus and severe contraction of the T cell repertoire with aging suggest that immune homeostasis in old age could be mediated by distinct effectors. Therefore, receptors expressed on T cells as they undergo senescence in vitro, as well as those displayed by circulating T cells during normal chronologic aging, were examined. Monitoring of T cells driven to senescence showed de novo induction of CD56, the prototypic receptor of NK cells. Analysis of fresh T cells in peripheral blood showed an age-dependent induction of CD56. These unusual T cells expressed high levels of Bcl2, p16, and p53, and had limited, or completely lost, ability to undergo cell division, properties consistent with senescence. CD56 cross-linking without TCR ligation on CD56(+) T cells resulted in extensive protein phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and Bax down-regulation. CD56 cross-linking was also sufficient to drive production of various humoral factors. These data suggest that the immun…
11520169	Distribution of aggrecanase (ADAMts 4/5) cleavage products in normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage: the influence of age, topography and zone of tissue.	aging	2001-08-??	OBJECTIVE: To develop and characterize a polyclonal antiserum (RAM 3.2), which recognizes the neo-C terminal cleavage product generated by the action of aggrecanase (ADAMts 4/5) on the G1-domain of human aggrecan. We also intend to use this antiserum to investigate normal, age-related changes in human articular cartilage.    METHOD: The antiserum was raised in rabbits and its localization in cryosections of normal articular cartilage was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The concentration of the aggrecanase neo-epitope was also investigated in extracts of the tissue using SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis in large pore/agarose gels.    RESULTS: The product of aggrecanase action appears to accumulate in the extracellular matrix during normal aging of the tissue. Furthermore, the concentration of the fragment depended on the topographical site on the femoral condyle from which the sample was selected. Electrophoretic and immunohistochemical analysis of the fragment in normal cartilage sho…
9467564	The insulin-like growth factor axis and plasma lipid levels in the elderly.	aging	1998-02-??	The activity of the hypothalamic-GH-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) network declines with age. It has recently been shown that increased cardiovascular mortality occurs in adults with GH deficiency. As hypercholesterolemia is common in GH-deficient adults, and because there is experimental evidence that GH may play a role in regulating plasma cholesterol, we decided to investigate the activity of the GH-IGF axis in an elderly population by measuring serum IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels and to study their relationship with blood lipid levels. One hundred and thirty-two elderly subjects, 52 men and 80 women, were studied (age range, 60-91 yr). Men had significantly lower levels of IGFBP-3, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoprotein A1 (ApoA1) compared to the women, whereas IGF-I and IGF-II were only slightly lower. Using linear regression analysis, we observed an inverse relationship of age with IGF-I (r = -0.35; P < 0.001), IGF-II (r = 0.40; …
3947693	Plasma melatonin--an index of brain aging in humans?	aging	1986-02-??	We investigated the age-related changes in the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin as a potential index of brain aging in man. The subjects were 5 young men aged 19-25 years, 11 older men aged 51-65 years, 6 elderly men aged 66-89 years, 7 young women aged 19-25 years, 5 premenopausal women aged 45-50 years, 8 postmenopausal women aged 51-65 years, and 5 elderly women aged 66-75 years. They were all physically and psychiatrically normal. Serial blood samples were drawn from 8:00 AM until 8:00 AM on the next day, with the indoor illumination set at 300 Lux from 7:00 AM until 4:00 PM and at 50 Lux thereafter. Plasma melatonin was estimated by radioimmunoassay. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between age and 24-hr secretion of plasma melatonin (r = -0.952, p less than 0.0001), between age and peak levels of plasma melatonin (r = -0.937, p less than 0.00001), and between age and the lag in time from sunset to the onset of significant elevation of plasma m…
18669935	Cytochrome P-450 2C9 signaling does not contribute to age-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction in humans.	aging	2008-10-??	Oxidative stress impairs endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) with aging in healthy sedentary adults. Increased cytochrome P-450 2C9 (CYP 2C9) signaling can contribute to oxidative stress-mediated suppression of EDD, but its role in aging is unknown. We hypothesized that inhibition of CYP 2C9 signaling with sulfaphenazole would improve EDD in older, but not young, healthy sedentary adults. At baseline, increases in forearm blood flow (FBF; venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to brachial artery infusions of ACh (1, 2, 4, and 8 microg.100 ml forearm volume(-1).min(-1)), an endothelium-dependent dilator, were smaller in older [n = 14, 63 +/- 1 (SE) yr] than in young (n = 11, 23 +/- 2 yr) adults (P < 0.05), with a reduction in peak FBF of 32% (11.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 17.3 +/- 2.3 ml.100 ml tissue(-1).min(-1)). Infusion of sulfaphenazole at doses that block CYP 2C9 signaling in humans did not affect the FBF responses to ACh in the older (peak FBF = 13.0 +/- 4.3 ml.100 ml tissue(-1).min(-…
28575261	Elder Self-neglect and Suicidal Ideation in an U.S. Chinese Aging Population: Findings From the PINE Study.	aging	2017-07-01	Background: Self-neglect and suicidal ideations are important public health issues among the aging population. This study aims to examine the association between self-neglect, its phenotypes, and suicidal ideation among U.S. Chinese older adults.    Methods: Guided by a community-based participatory research approach, the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study is a population-based epidemiological study conducted from 2011 to 2013 among 3,159 Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older in the Greater Chicago area. Self-neglect was assessed by a 27-item instrument, describing five phenotypes with hoarding, poor personal hygiene, unsanitary condition, lack of utilities, and need of home repair. Suicidal ideation was assessed by the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Geriatric Mental State Examination-Version A (GMS-A). Logistic regression is utilized to analyze the association.    Results: Higher level of self-neglect was found signific…
7733395	Cortisol, ACTH, and cardiovascular response to a cognitive challenge paradigm in aging and depression.	aging	1995-04-??	Aging and hypercortisolism may be associated with alterations of stress-induced hormone release. We therefore studied 20 normal controls of two different age groups (< 30 and > 60 yr of age) and 20 age-matched patients with major depression; baseline ACTH and cortisol secretion (between 1400 and 1700) as well as blood pressure and heart rate and their responses to a 45-min lasting signal detection task (1705-1750) were determined. No difference in basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system activity between young and older healthy controls was noted. The cognitive challenge resulted in an increase in stress-induced hormonal secretion that was greater in the older controls than in their young counterparts. Basal hypercortisolemia and, at baseline, heart rates were higher in depressed patients, regardless of age. Blood pressure was elevated in older healthy controls as well as depressed patients. With the exception of the young depressed patients, all groups responded with an incre…
15240600	Physiological testosterone replenishment in healthy elderly men does not normalize pituitary growth hormone output: evidence against the connection between senile hypogonadism and somatopause.	aging	2004-07-??	Normal aging in men is accompanied by lower serum testosterone (T), GH, and IGF-I concentrations. The mechanisms of the age-related diminution in the activity of the somatotropic axis (somatopause) are uncertain. Several explanations have been proposed, including a lower hypothalamic GHRH output. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the physiological hypogonadism that accompanies normal aging is responsible for GHRH deficiency. We assessed the suppressibility of spontaneous and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion by a specific competitive GHRH receptor antagonist in seven elderly (61-76 yr old) and six young (20-23 yr old) healthy nonobese men. Elderly men then received transdermal T (5 mg/d) for 5-6 wk and had the same experiment repeated. Mean final total T, free T, and dihydrotestosterone increased in elderly men [521.5 +/- 56.3 vs. 395.4 +/- 57.2 ng/dl (P = 0.021), 13.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 10.1 +/- 1.7 pg/ml (P = 0.017), and 71.4 +/- 8.9 vs. 41 +/- 8.1 ng/dl (P = 0.004), r…
28168364	Effects of aging on T₁, T₂*, and QSM MRI values in the subcortex.	aging	2017-??-??	The aging brain undergoes several anatomical changes that can be measured with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Early studies using lower field strengths have assessed changes in tissue properties mainly qualitatively, using [Formula: see text]- or [Formula: see text]- weighted images to provide image contrast. With the development of higher field strengths (7 T and above) and more advanced MRI contrasts, quantitative measures can be acquired even of small subcortical structures. This study investigates volumetric, spatial, and quantitative MRI parameter changes associated with healthy aging in a range of subcortical nuclei, including the basal ganglia, red nucleus, and the periaqueductal grey. The results show that aging has a heterogenous effects across regions. Across the subcortical areas an increase of [Formula: see text] values is observed, most likely indicating a loss of myelin. Only for a number of areas, a decrease of [Formula: see text] and increase of QSM is found, indicat…
21247292	Are urology residents adequately exposed to conservative therapies for managing small renal masses?	aging	2011-01-??	PURPOSE: Increasing diagnosis of small renal masses (SRMs) necessitates trainees to be familiar with available therapies. We hypothesized that involvement in conservative treatments (ablation and/or active surveillance) occurs infrequently. Therefore, we evaluated resident exposure and participation in treatments as well as proposed management for SRMs.    METHODS: A survey was distributed to residents of the American Urologic Association and queried exposure to ablation and surveillance for SRMs. Three case scenarios (SRM in a healthy 55-year-old, healthy 75-year-old, and comorbid 75-year-old patient) were presented for management.    RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-seven residents responded to the survey. Two hundred thirty-four (91%) reported ablation was offered at their institution, although only 140 (54%) ever participated in this procedure. Of these, 80 (57%) were involved in fewer than five procedures. Experience with ablation did not increase at higher levels of training (U3-61%, U…
16257642	Overexpression of MsrA protects WI-38 SV40 human fibroblasts against H2O2-mediated oxidative stress.	aging	2005-11-15	Proteins are modified by reactive oxygen species, and oxidation of specific amino acid residues can impair their biological functions, leading to an alteration in cellular homeostasis. Oxidized proteins can be eliminated through either degradation or repair. Repair is limited to the reversion of a few modifications such as the reduction of methionine oxidation by the methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) system. However, accumulation of oxidized proteins occurs during aging, replicative senescence, or neurological disorders or after an oxidative stress, while Msr activity is impaired. In order to more precisely analyze the relationship between oxidative stress, protein oxidative damage, and MsrA, we stably overexpressed MsrA full-length cDNA in SV40 T antigen-immortalized WI-38 human fibroblasts. We report here that MsrA-overexpressing cells are more resistant than control cells to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, but not to ultraviolet A irradiation. This MsrA-mediated resis…
4039326	Are cross-bridging structures involved in the bundle formation of intermediate filaments and the decrease in locomotion that accompany cell aging?	aging	1985-05-??	Five different fibroblast strains derived from donors of a wide range of ages were used for investigation of senescence-associated changes in the organization of intermediate filaments (IFs) and the activity of cell locomotion. Results of immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that, in large and flat in vitro aged fibroblasts, vimentin-containing IFs are distributed as unusually organized large bundles. Electron microscopic examination shows that these large bundles are indeed composed of filaments of 8-10 nm. Such a profile of large bundles is rarely seen in young fibroblasts whose IFs are usually interdispersed among microtubules. Within the large filament bundles of senescent fibroblasts, cross-bridge-like extensions are frequently observed along the individual IFs. Immunogold labeling with antibody to one of the cross-bridging proteins, p50, further illustrates the abundance of interfilament links within the IF bundles. The senescence-related increase in interfilament associatio…
2380336	Vitamin D status and related parameters in a healthy population: the effects of age, sex, and season.	aging	1990-08-??	The effects of age, sex, renal function, and seasonal variation on serum parameters within the vitamin D endocrine system were studied cross-sectionally in a healthy population of 167 men and 114 women, aged 20-94 yr. Serum 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [25OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D] did not decline with age in either sex. Nonlinear regression using a sine function showed a significant seasonal variation in 25OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D in both sexes (P less than 0.005). Serum intact PTH increased significantly by 35% over the age span in both sexes (P less than 0.005). In women, serum phosphorus and total and ionized calcium remained constant with age. In sharp contrast, males had a marked 25% fall in phosphorus across the age span (r = -0.564; P less than 0.0001) and a slight but significant 4% decline in total and ionized calcium. Creatinine clearance declined markedly with age, but was not related to 1,25-(OH)2D in either sex. Only in men was there a significant but modest inverse relat…
22468945	Concord grape juice supplementation and neurocognitive function in human aging.	aging	2012-06-13	Polyphenol compounds found in berry fruits, in particular flavonoids, have been associated with health benefits including improvement in cognition and neuronal function with aging. Concord grape juice contains polyphenols, including anthocyanins and flavanols, and previous research has shown improvement in a number of human health conditions with grape juice supplementation. In the current study, older adult subjects with mild cognitive impairment consumed Concord grape juice or placebo for 16 weeks and were administered assessments of memory function and brain activation pre- and postintervention. Participants who consumed grape juice showed reduced semantic interference on memory tasks. Relatively greater activation in anterior and posterior regions of the right hemisphere was also observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging in the grape juice treated subjects. These findings provide further evidence that Concord grape juice can enhance neurocognitive function in older adults…
8028395	Intracellular Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase levels in T and non-T cells from normal aged subjects.	aging	1994-01-??	The decreased immune response associated with aging may, in part, reflect intrinsic age-related biochemical alteration in lymphocytes from older subjects. The 'reactive oxygen species hypothesis' of aging postulates that these molecules are involved in the modifications leading to cellular senescence. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and in particular the Cu/Zn-dependent intracellular form, plays a critical role in the defense against these species, but it is controversial whether this function declines in lymphocytes in old age. We utilized two different methods to evaluate Cu/Zn SOD levels in T and non-T cells (CD3+, CD3-, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+) from young and old individuals: a specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassay performed on extracts of sorted cells, and a flow cytometry double fluorescence technique with monoclonal antibodies against Cu/Zn SOD and the different lymphocyte subsets. The Cu/Zn SOD cell content was assayed both in basal conditions and after peripheral blood lymphocyte st…
11271847	Time spent outdoors and seasonal variation in serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Korean women.	aging	2000-11-??	The vitamin D status of 179 Korean women between the ages of 20 and 75 were measured by the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Related biochemical indices such as iPTH, alkaline, phosphatase, creatinine, albumin, Ca, Mg, and P were also measured. Factors such as demographic characteristics, intake of foods containing vitamin D, and proxy measure of sunlight exposure (time spent outdoors) were assessed to determine their effect on vitamin D status and used in the analysis. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first was to define reference data for the distribution of vitamin D status and to explore the relationship between vitamin D and the variables that affect the vitamin D status in Korean women. The second was to analyze the risk factors of the vitamin D status and the relation between the factors. The results of this study will provide valuable information regarding the role of vitamin D in Korean women. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level was…
7075066	On aging bone loss.	aging	1982-05-??	A survey was done of aging changes in compact and trabecular bone. During the past decade, noninvasive methods have demonstrated similar results for compact bone in large samples. Aging decreases of 3%/decade begin at about age 40 in both sexes and continue, but in women, an additional loss occurs after menopause, bringing their total rate of decrease to 9%/decade between ages 45 and 75. Results on trabecular bone loss are more variable, the majority indicating a slightly lower rate of loss (6% to 8% decade), beginning in young adulthood (20 to 40 years) in both sexes. These findings suggest that the common assumption about a large ongoing loss of trabecular bone after menopause may be erroneous. These assumptions are examined, as are the implications of the findings for calcium metabolism, anatomical correlations and fracture incidences.
274711	Aspartic acid racemization in heavy molecular weight crystallins and water insoluble protein from normal human lenses and cataracts.	aging	1978-03-??	High D/L aspartic acid ratios are observed in heavy molecular weight aggregates and in water-insoluble protein extracted from whole lenses and nuclear and cortical regions. Purified alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins have low D/L ratios. Fractionation of urea-solubilized material from the water-insoluble protein yields four molecular weight classes of proteins. Fractions representing crosslinked material or apparently degraded products have high D/L ratios. Racemization within lens proteins may contribute to formation of the water-insoluble fraction seen in aging lenses and cataracts.
22155176	Systems genetics of the nuclear factor-κB signal transduction network. I. Detection of several quantitative trait loci potentially relevant to aging.	aging	2012-01-??	A theory of aging holds that senescence is caused by a dysregulated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signal transduction network (STN). We adopted a systems genetics approach in our study of the NF-κB STN. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was used to identify gene/gene product interactions between NF-κB and the genes in our transcriptional profiling array. Principal components factor analysis (PCFA) was performed on a sub-network of 19 genes, including two initiators of the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88) and TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). TLR pathways are either MyD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent. Therefore, we also performed PCFA on a subset excluding the MyD88 transcript, and on another subset excluding two TRIF transcripts. Using linkage analysis we found that each set gave rise to at least one factor with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score greater than 3, two on c…
24893584	Association of living alone and hospitalization among community-dwelling elders with and without dementia.	aging	2014-11-??	BACKGROUND: Older persons account for the majority of hospitalizations in the United States.1 Identifying risk factors for hospitalization among elders, especially potentially preventable hospitalization, may suggest opportunities to improve primary care. Certain factors-for example, living alone-may increase the risk for hospitalization, and their effect may be greater among persons with dementia and the old-old (aged 85+).    OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of living alone and risk for hospitalization, and see if the observed effect is greater among persons with dementia or the old-old.    DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study.    PARTICIPANTS: 2,636 participants in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a longitudinal cohort study of dementia incidence. Participants were adults aged 65+ enrolled in an integrated health care system who completed biennial follow-up visits to assess for dementia and living situation.    MAIN MEASURES: Hospitalization for all cause…
20018825	Plasma cytokine levels in a population-based study: relation to age and ethnicity.	aging	2010-04-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is one factor believed to contribute to processes that underlie chronic low-grade inflammation in older adults. Moreover, more recent studies have suggested that cytokine levels are influenced by ethnicity.    METHODS: In this study, we determined plasma cytokine profiles in a population-based sample (n = 1,411; aged 25-91 years) to determine the relationship between circulating cytokine levels, aging, and ethnicity. We measured interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), interleukin (IL)-6, -10, C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-r1).    RESULTS: IL-6 and TNF-r1 significantly increased with age, whereas IL-1ra, IL-10, and CRP did not significantly increase with age. After adjusting for age, non-Hispanic whites had significantly higher levels of IL-1ra than Mexican Americans, whereas non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher levels of IL-6 and CRP than Mexican Americans as well as non-Hispanic whites. CRP levels in non-Hispanic blac…
17991883	Angiotensin II-mediated oxidative DNA damage accelerates cellular senescence in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells via telomere-dependent and independent pathways.	aging	2008-02-01	Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). ROS have been implicated in the development of both acute stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) and chronic replicative senescence. Global oxidative DNA damage triggers SIPS and telomere DNA damage accelerates replicative senescence, both mediated via p53. This study tests the hypothesis that DNA is an important target for Ang II-induced ROS leading to senescence via telomere-dependent and independent pathways. DNA damage was quantified using the Comet assay, telomere DNA length by Southern blotting and hVSMC senescence by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining. Exposure to Ang II increased DNA damage in hVSMCs within 4 hours. Inhibition by an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan metabolite: E3174) or catalase, confirmed that Ang II-induced DNA damage was AT1 receptor-mediated, via the induction of ROS. Acute exposure to Ang II resulted in SIPS within 24…
1733608	Age-correlated modifications of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and glutathione-related enzyme activities in human erythrocytes.	aging	1992-01-??	To obtain a comprehensive profile of the erythrocyte antioxidant defense potential during aging, we investigated copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), seleno-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GSH-S-T) activities in human erythrocytes from 167 apparently healthy subjects, ages one month to 63 years (102 females, 65 males). We found a negative correlation between age and activities of CuZn-SOD (r = 0.362, P less than 0.001), GSSG-RD (r = 0.549, P less than 0.001), and GSH-S-T (r = 0.575, P less than 0.001). In contrast, we found a positive correlation between age and GSH-Px activity (r = 0.401, P less than 0.001). To evaluate aging changes, we divided the subjects into five groups: Group 1 (newborn-age one year), Group 2 (1-11 years), Group 3 (11-25 years), Group 4 (25-40 years), and Group 5 (40-63 years). Significant age-related modifications in erythrocyte enzyme activities appeared in Group 3 for CuZn-SOD,…
27084712	The glycation of fibronectin by glycolaldehyde and methylglyoxal as a model for aging in Bruch's membrane.	aging	2016-??-??	The purpose of the study is to identify the sites of modification when fibronectin reacts with glycolaldehyde or methylglyoxal as a model system for aging of Bruch's membrane. A synthetic peptide consisting of the α5β1 integrin binding region of fibronectin was incubated with glycolaldehyde for 12 h or with methylglyoxal for 1 h at 37 °C. After tryptic digestion, the samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Tandem MS was used to determine the sites of modification. The adducts, aldoamine and N (ε)-carboxymethyl-lysine, attached preferably at lysine residues when the fibronectin peptide reacted with glycolaldehyde. When the fibronectin peptide reacted with methylglyoxal, modifications occurred at lysine and arginine residues. At lysine residues, N (ε)-carboxyethyl-lysine adducts were present. At arginine residues, hydroimidazolone and tetrapyrimidine adducts were present. Several advanced glycation endproducts were generated when fibronectin was glycat…
18073271	Aging alters gene expression of growth and remodeling factors in human skeletal muscle both at rest and in response to acute resistance exercise.	aging	2008-02-19	The purpose of this investigation was to compare expression of genes that function in inflammation and stress, cell structure and signaling, or remodeling and growth in skeletal muscle of young (32 +/- 7 yr, n = 15) and elderly (72 +/- 5 yr, n = 16) healthy subjects before and after a bout of resistance leg exercises. A real-time RT-PCR method was used to screen 100 transcripts in v. lateralis biopsies obtained before and 72 h postexercise. The screen identified 15 candidates for differential expression due to aging and/or exercise that were measured quantitatively. The median levels of four mRNAs (insulin-like growth factor-1 and its binding protein IGFBP5, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and the metallopeptidase MMP2) were significantly affected by aging and were greater (1.6- to 2.3-fold, P </= 0.05) in the young than elderly muscle at both time points. The median levels of three mRNAs were significantly (P </= 0.05) affected by exercise in the young. The metallopeptidase inhibitor TIM…
8611178	Age-related changes in the content of the C-terminal region of aggrecan in human articular cartilage.	aging	1996-02-01	The content of the C-terminal region of aggrecan was investigated in samples of articular cartilage from individuals ranging in age from newborn to 65 years. This region contains the globular G3 domain which is known to be removed from aggrecan in mature cartilage, probably by proteolytic cleavage, but the age-related changes in its abundance in human cartilage have not been described previously. The analysis was performed by immunosorbant assay using an antiserum (JD5) against recombinant amino acid residues of human aggrecan, on crude extracts of cartilage without further purification of aggrecan. The results showed that the content of the C-terminal region decreased with age relative to the G1 domain content (correlation coefficient = 0.463). This represented a 92% fall in the content of this region of the molecule from newborn to 65 years of age. furthermore, when the G1 content of the cartilage extracts was corrected to only include the G1 attached to aggrecan and to exclude the G…
21084679	Analytical construct of reversible desensitization of pituitary-testicular signaling: illustrative application in aging.	aging	2011-02-??	Luteinizing hormone (LH) administered in pharmacological amounts downregulates Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Whether reversible downregulation of physiological gonadotropin drive operates in vivo is unknown. Most of the analytical models of dose-response functions that have been constructed are biased by the assumption that no downregulation exists. The present study employs a new analytical platform to quantify potential (but not required) pulsatile cycles of LH-testosterone (T) dose-response stimulation, desensitization, and recovery (pulse-by-pulse hysteresis) in 26 healthy men sampled every 10 min for 24 h. A sensitivity-downregulation hysteresis construct predicted marked hysteresis with a median time delay to LH dose-response inflection within individual T pulses of 23 min and with median T pulse onset and recovery LH sensitivities of 1.1 and 0.10 slope unit, respectively (P < 0.001). A potency-downregulation model yielded median estimates of one-half maximally stimulatory LH conc…
15603832	Age-related transparent root dentin: mineral concentration, crystallite size, and mechanical properties.	aging	2005-06-??	Many fractures occur in teeth that have been altered, for example restored or endodontically repaired. It is therefore essential to evaluate the structure and mechanical properties of these altered dentins. One such altered form of dentin is transparent (sometimes called sclerotic) dentin, which forms gradually with aging. The present study focuses on differences in the structure and mechanical properties of normal versus transparent dentin. The mineral concentration, as measured by X-ray computed microtomography, was significantly higher in transparent dentin, the elevated concentration being consistent with the closure of the tubule lumens. Crystallite size, as measured by small angle X-ray scattering, was slightly smaller in transparent dentin, although the importance of this finding requires further study. The elastic properties were unchanged by transparency; however, transparent dentin, unlike normal dentin, exhibited almost no yielding before failure. In addition, the fracture t…
3972964	The influence of age on the 24-hour integrated concentration of growth hormone in normal individuals.	aging	1985-03-??	We examined changes in spontaneously secreted growth hormone with aging by studying the 24-h integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH) of 173 nonobese subjects (height, greater than or equal to 5%; 7-65 yr of age). There was no significant difference in IC-GH on repeat testing of 13 men or in 23 women studied in the follicular and again in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The level of IC-GH was strongly effected by age; children had the highest mean IC-GH, and there was a decline in IC-GH with increasing age after the second decade of life. The correlation of IC-GH with age was highly significant (r = 0.73; P less than 0.0001). There was no difference in IC-GH between males and females when matched for age. The mean IC-GH at Tanner stage 5 of puberty (7.4 +/- 2.0 ng/ml) was higher than that at stages 2-4 (5.7 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.0005) or that in prepubertal children (5.8 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.001). Thus, age and pubertal status must be carefully considered when interpreting th…
2951313	Plasma levels of beta-endorphin in young and aged human males during the morning hours.	aging	1987-01-??	Age-related alterations in plasma levels of beta-endorphin (BE) were investigated in young and aged human males. This was accomplished by obtaining repeated measurements of BE levels in the plasma of young and aged human male subjects during the morning hours, when a diurnal elevation of BE in the plasma is reported to occur. BE was extracted from the plasma and measured by radioimmunoassay. No differences were found in plasma levels of BE between young and elderly males at any time during the time period studied. In addition, the mean level of BE in the plasma during the entire sampling period did not differ between the two age groups. These data suggest that in human males, the levels of BE in the plasma during the morning hours are not modified by aging.
16289923	TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human naïve and memory CD8+ T cells in aged humans.	aging	2006-01-??	Recently, human CD8+ T cells have been divided into naïve, central memory (T(CM)), and two types of effector memory cells (T(EM) and T(EMRA)), which are phenotypically identified by a set of cell surface molecules. In this investigation, we have compared the relative sensitivity of these subsets to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in young and aged humans. Our data show increased sensitivity of naïve and T(CM) CD8+ T cells from aged humans to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis as compared to young subjects. Both T(EM) and T(EMRA) CD8+ T cells from young and aged subjects were relatively resistant to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and no significant difference was observed between young and aged subjects. Increased apoptosis of naïve and T(CM) CD8+ T cells in aged humans was associated with increased activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 as compared to young subjects. There was no difference in the expression of TNFR-I or TNFR-II on any of the four subpopulations of CD8+ T cells between young and aged…
670307	DNA replication in human lymphocytes during aging.	aging	1978-08-??	An analysis of the accuracy of protein and DNA synthesis in human lymphocytes with respect to aging has been carried out. The response of human peripheral lymphocytes, from young and old adults, to phytohemagglutinin was measured at varying temperatures. This should provide a sensitive test for the accumulation of altered thermolabile proteins that are rate limiting in the response to phytohemagglutinin. At 37 degrees C the rate of thymidine incorporation as well as the induction of DNA polymerase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from old and young adults were similar. Also at elevated temperatures, the thermosensitivity of DNA replication in lymphocytes from young and old adults was the same. DNA polymerase was purified from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from young and old adults. The fidelity of DNA synthesis using poly (dC) as a template was similar with both enzymes. However, DNA polymerase-alpha purified from old adults was thermolabile compared to the enzyme from young a…
10363791	NK phenotypic markers and IL2 response in NK cells from elderly people.	aging	1999-04-??	Immunosenescence is a process that primarily affects the T cell compartment of the immune system, although age-associated immunological alterations have also been demonstrated in the NK cell phenotype and function. A significant expansion in the number of NK cells is found in aging. The NK cytotoxic capacity of total peripheral blood lymphocytes is also well preserved, not only in healthy elderly people but also in centenarians. However, NK cell killing of K562 is impaired when considered in a per-cell basis, and this defect is associated with defective signal transduction after activation more than a diminished conjugate formation or killing capacity. We have studied the phenotype of NK cells in elderly donors fulfilling the Senieur criteria. We have also studied the capacity of these cells to be activated by IL2 when different NK cell functions, other than cytotoxicity, are considered. Our results confirm the increased percentage of NK cells in the elderly due to the expansion of the…
22822023	Vitamin D deficiency, smoking, and lung function in the Normative Aging Study.	aging	2012-10-01	RATIONALE: Vitamin D has immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects that may be modified by cigarette smoke and may affect lung function.    OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of vitamin D deficiency and smoking on lung function and lung function decline.    METHODS: A total of 626 men from the Normative Aging Study had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels measured at three different times between 1984 and 2003 with concurrent spirometry. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum level ≤ 20 ng/ml. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariable linear regression and mixed effects models.    MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the overall cohort, there was no significant effect of vitamin D deficiency on lung function or on lung function decline. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariable models, there was effect modification by vitamin D status on the association between smoking and lung function. Cross-sectional analysis revealed lower lung function in current smokers with vi…
22645500	Antioxidant protection against curative and palliative doses of ionizing irradiation in human blood decreases with aging.	aging	2012-??-??	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are independently recognized to play a significant role in radiation-induced damage on healthy tissue and in aging process. However, an age-related alteration of antioxidant (AO) system in radiation response in humans is poorly investigated. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the irradiation effects on the activities and expression of AO system in the blood of healthy women during aging. Blood samples were irradiated with curative and palliative doses of 2 Gy or 9 Gy γ-rays. AO capacity for detoxification of O(2)•(-) and H(2)O(2) in response to 2 Gy γ-irradiation decreases in women above 58 years, while in response to 9 Gy shows signs of weakening after 45 years of age. Due to reduction of AO capacity during aging, cytotoxic effects of curative and palliative doses of irradiation, mediated by ROS, may significantly increase in older subjects, while removal of H(2)O(2) excess could reduce them.
10391129	Aging differentially modulates the expression of collagen and collagenase in dermal fibroblasts.	aging	1999-04-??	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of aging on collagen and collagenase expression by human dermal fibroblasts. To evaluate this effect, the expression of these ECM was determined and compared between either fetal and adult fibroblasts or dermal fibroblasts at various passages. A total of 13 cell strains, 8 fetal foreskin and 5 adult dermal fibroblasts, were grown to 80-90% confluency and their rates of cell proliferation and expression of mRNA for collagenase (MMP-1) and pro alpha1(I) chain of type I collagen was determined and compared. Fetal cells had a significantly higher rate of proliferation relative to adult fibroblasts evaluated within 10 days of culture. Northern analysis was used to evaluate the steady state levels of mRNA in these cells. The result of these experiments revealed a significantly greater expression of mRNA for collagenase (58.6 +/- 7.7 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.5, p < 0.05) in strains of adult fibroblasts. This was consistent with collagenase activity of …
16085119	Elastin peptides induced oxidation of LDL by phagocytic cells.	aging	2005-09-??	The degradation products of one of the major component of vascular wall, elastin, have several important biological activities. Elastin peptides (KE) are mostly generated during vascular aging and the atherosclerotic process. They induce free radical and proteases production from cells, which are the major components of the atherosclerotic process. In the present study, we investigated whether the interaction between elastin peptides and neutrophils as well as monocytes contributes to low density lipoproteins (LDL) oxidation, being one of the most important initiator of the chronic inflammatory process contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. Here, we present data on the link between the elastin degradation products and LDL oxidation by the chemotactically attracted neutrophils and monocytes. The KE as well as the active epitope, the hexapeptide VGVAPG is able, in a differential concentration and time dependence, to induce the oxidation of LDL. KE is able to induce via the p…
21849522	The relationships between sex hormones and sexual function in middle-aged and older European men.	aging	2011-10-??	CONTEXT: Limited data are available exploring the associations between sex hormones, multiple domains of sexual functioning, and sexual function-related distress in nonpatient samples in Europe.    OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between serum testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and sexual function in a multicenter population-based study of aging in men.    DESIGN: Using stratified random sampling, 2838 men aged 40-79 yr completed the European Male Ageing Study-Sexual Function Questionnaire and provided a blood sample for hormone measurements. T, E2, and DHT were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.    SETTING: We conducted a community-based population survey in eight European centers.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported sexual function (overall sexual function, sexual function-related distress, erectile dysfunction, masturbation) was measured.    RESULTS: Total and free T, but not E2 or DHT, was asso…
24503194	Performance characteristic of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) assay on Korean rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls.	aging	2014-04-??	The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the established anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to Rheumatoid Factor-Immunoglobulin M (RF-IgM) and C - reactive protein (CRP). Serum samples of 176 patients were analyzed with the anti-CCP ELISA assay method established in our laboratory. The results of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the other inflammatory patients, and healthy controls were compared using MedCalc (version 7.0). The anti-CCP assay results were compared with RF-IgM and CRP concentration analyzed in Catholic University. The specificity of ELISA test results of RA patients showed 91% and 87%, when healthy controls or osteoarthritis patients were considered as negative. Thus, the established ELISA method was RA specific, but its sensitivity was low. To see the low sensitivity may from aging effect, the concentration of anti-CCP was analyzed for different aging group. We tested 110 healthy cont…
8795718	The self-reactive antibody repertoire of normal human serum IgM is acquired in early childhood and remains conserved throughout life.	aging	1996-09-??	The authors have used a quantitative immunoblotting technique to analyse the antibody repertoire of IgM in cord blood and in the serum of young children, young adult males and aged males directed towards antigens in homologous tissues utilized as sources of self antigens. The reactivities of IgM with self antigens exhibited striking homogeneity and invariance among newborns. Self-reactive IgM repertoires of children, young adults and aged males were markedly conserved among individuals and comprised most of the anti-self reactivities that prevailed in neonates. Reactivities of IgM with bacterial antigens showed a high degree of homogeneity among newborns but were more diverse in children, young adults and elderly individuals. Diversity of IgM reactivities with self and non-self antigens did not vary significantly with aging. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the data discriminated between self-reactive IgM repertoires of newborns and children,…
3762233	Neutrophils of healthy aged humans are normal.	aging	1986-09-??	Polymorphonuclear functions are reported to be altered in aged humans. We have previously shown that chemotactic response, adherence, oxidative metabolism and Candida killing activity were abnormal in subjects over 70 years. These results lead us to investigate further the basic mechanisms of these alterations in a complementary series of elderly people over 75 years. However, we used in the present study the admission criteria of the SENIEUR protocol specially designed for immunogerontological investigations in humans. Neither the tests exploring the functions as a whole (migration and bacterial killing) nor those investigating the elementary components of these functions exhibited significant difference when compared to the sex-matched young controls. The discrepancy with our prior results is probably explained by the fact that the presently tested subjects had been selected according to more strict criteria. These data clearly demonstrate that neutrophils are intrinsically normal in…
6427148	Effect of aging on ventilatory response to exercise and CO2.	aging	1984-05-??	Studies were performed to determine the effects of aging on the ventilatory responsiveness to two known respiratory stimulants, inhaled CO2 and exercise. Although explanation of the physiological mechanisms underlying development of exercise hyperpnea remains elusive, there is much circumstantial evidence that during exercise, however mediated, ventilation is coupled to CO2 production. Thus matched groups of young and elderly subjects were studied to determine the relationship between increasing ventilation and increasing CO2 production (VCO2) during steady-state exercise and the change in their minute ventilation in response to progressive hypercapnia during CO2 rebreathing. We found that the slope of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia was depressed in elderly subjects when compared with the younger control group (delta VE/delta PCO2 = 1.64 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.40 l X min-1 X mmHg-1, means +/- SE, respectively). In contrast, the slope of the relationship between ventilation an…
30228872	Recent advances in understanding the role of FOXO3.	longevity	2018-??-??	The forkhead box O3 (FOXO3, or FKHRL1) protein is a member of the FOXO subclass of transcription factors. FOXO proteins were originally identified as regulators of insulin-related genes; however, they are now established regulators of genes involved in vital biological processes, including substrate metabolism, protein turnover, cell survival, and cell death.  is one of the rare genes that have been consistently linked to longevity in  models. This review provides an update of the most recent research pertaining to the role of FOXO3 in (i) the regulation of protein turnover in skeletal muscle, the largest protein pool of the body, and (ii) the genetic basis of longevity. Finally, it examines (iii) the role of microRNAs in the regulation of FOXO3 and its impact on the regulation of the cell cycle.
24594440	Wavelet coherence analysis of spontaneous oscillations in cerebral tissue oxyhemoglobin concentrations and arterial blood pressure in elderly subjects.	aging	2014-05-??	This study aims to assess the relationship between spontaneous oscillations in changes in cerebral tissue oxyhemoglobin concentrations (Delta [HbO2]) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals in healthy elderly subjects during the resting state using wavelet coherence analysis. Continuous recordings of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and ABP signals were obtained from simultaneous measurements in 33 healthy elderly subjects (age: 70.7±7.9 years) and 27 young subjects (age: 25.2±3.7 years) during the resting state. The coherence between Delta [HbO2] and ABP oscillations in six frequency intervals (I, 0.4-2 Hz; II, 0.15-0.4 Hz; III, 0.05-0.15 Hz; IV, 0.02-0.05 Hz, V, 0.005-0.0095 Hz and VI, 0.005-0.0095 Hz) was analyzed using wavelet coherence analysis. In elderly subjects, the Delta [HbO2] and ABP oscillations were significantly wavelet coherent in interval I, and wavelet phase coherent in intervals I, II and IV. The wavelet coherence in interval I was significantly higher (p=0.040), …
12847160	Inflammatory markers and cognition in well-functioning African-American and white elders.	aging	2003-07-08	BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence suggest that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to AD.    OBJECTIVE: To examine whether several markers of inflammation are associated with cognitive decline in African-American and white well-functioning elders.    METHODS: The authors studied 3,031 African-American and white men and women (mean age 74 years) enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) were measured at baseline; cognition was assessed with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive decline was defined as a decline of >5 points.    RESULTS: In age-adjusted analyses, participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 or CRP performed nearly 2 points lower (worse) on baseline and follow-up 3MS (p < 0.001 for all) and declined by almost 1 point over the >2 years (p = 0.01 for IL-6 and p = 0.04 for CRP) compa…
22423144	Comparison of serum testosterone and estradiol measurements in 3174 European men using platform immunoassay and mass spectrometry; relevance for the diagnostics in aging men.	aging	2012-06-??	BACKGROUND: The limitations of serum testosterone and estradiol (E(2)) measurements using non-extraction platform immunoassays (IAs) are widely recognized. Switching to more specific mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods has been advocated, but directly comparative data on the two methods are scarce.    METHODS: We compared serum testosterone and E(2) measurements in a large sample of middle-aged/elderly men using a common platform IA and a gas chromatography (GC)-MS method, in order to assess their limitations and advantages, and to diagnose male hypogonadism. Of subjects from the European Male Aging Study (n=3174; age 40-79 years), peripheral serum testosterone and E(2) were analyzed using established commercial platform IAs (Roche Diagnostics E170) and in-house GC-MS methods.    RESULTS: Over a broad concentration range, serum testosterone concentration measured by IA and MS showed high correlation (R=0.93, P<0.001), which was less robust in the hypogonadal range (<11 nmol/l; R=0.72,…
19666829	Neural processing during older adults' comprehension of spoken sentences: age differences in resource allocation and connectivity.	aging	2010-04-??	Speech comprehension remains largely preserved in older adults despite significant age-related neurophysiological change. However, older adults' performance declines more rapidly than that of young adults when listening conditions are challenging. We investigated the cortical network underlying speech comprehension in healthy aging using short sentences differing in syntactic complexity, with processing demands further manipulated through speech rate. Neural activity was monitored using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comprehension of syntactically complex sentences activated components of a core sentence-processing network in both young and older adults, including the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. However, older adults showed reduced recruitment of inferior frontal regions relative to young adults; the individual degree of recruitment predicted accuracy at the more difficult fas…
202816	Plasma membrane associated metabolic parameters and the aging of human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1978-02-??	Substrate uptake, portions of the cyclic AMP system, membrane fluidity and cellular phospholipid content are some of the parameters which are structurally associated with the plasma membrane and which have been linked to the control of cell proliferation. These parameters were studied with respect to cellular aging of human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELF) in culture. We observed in late passage an increase in the rate of uridine transport and in cellular cyclic AMP levels. These results were examined in relation to the increase in cell volume which occurs in senescing HELF. We also observed an increase in Vmax of uridine transport, and a decrease in the Km of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) as quiescent, passage 18-25, HELF were stimulated to divide with fresh serum. A similar effect of serum occurred in late passage (p. 43) cells despite the inability of these late passage cultures to undergo further proliferation. There was no change in cAMP-PDE activity with increasing passage num…
6229246	Effects of aging on atrial and ventricular human myosin.	aging	????-??-??	Enzymatic and structural studies of human cardiac myosin from young and old subjects have been investigated to determine possible changes in myosin properties in aging hearts. Human ventricular myosin from old subjects (47-70 years old) has lower actin-activated ATPase activity than and increased alkaline sensitivity as compared to myosin from young subjects (1-132 months old). Ca2+-and K+(EDTA)-ATPase activities, pyrophosphate gel patterns and one-dimensional peptide mapping of heavy chains of ventricular myosin from old subjects are similar to those observed for myosin from young subjects. Atrial myosin from human hearts differs significantly from ventricular myosin in that the Ca2+-, Mg2+- and actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase activities of atrial myosin are significantly higher than those of ventricular myosin. Pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis patterns and peptide mapping of heavy chains of atrial myosin are also different from those of ventricular myosin. Unlike ventricular myos…
1372922	Postprandial cholecystokinin secretion in elderly with protein-energy undernutrition.	aging	1992-04-??	OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is currently observed in aged people, and cholecystokinin is an important peripheral satiety signal. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of aging and protein-energy malnutrition on postprandial cholecystokinin (CCK) release.    DESIGN: Non-randomized, cross-sectional comparison by age group.    SETTING: Gastroenterology section of a teaching hospital.    PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one human volunteers divided into three groups: young healthy subjects (Group 1: mean 29 years, n = 7), aged healthy subjects (Group 2, mean 80 years, n = 7), and aged subjects with an important degree of malnutrition (Group 3, mean 84.6 years, n = 7).    INTERVENTION: Each subject ingested a standardized liquid meal after an overnight fast.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma cholecystokinin was measured using a sensitive bioassay before and after the ingestion of the liquid meal.    RESULTS: Basal cholecystokinin levels were similar (0.9 to 1 pM equivalent CCK-8) in the three grou…
19363089	Acute effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in older adults.	lifespan	2009-05-??	The present study investigated the effects of acute aerobic exercise on cognitive brain functions of older adults. Twenty-four males (12 older and 12 younger adults) performed a modified flanker task during a baseline session (no exercise) and after light and moderate cycling exercise in counterbalanced order on different days while measures of task performance and the P3 component of an event-related brain potential were collected. The results indicated that, for both age groups, reaction time following moderate exercise was shorter relative to the other sessions, and P3 latencies following both light and moderate exercise were shorter compared with the baseline session. In contrast, P3 amplitude increased only following moderate exercise in younger adults. These findings suggest that light and moderate exercises improve cognitive function across the adult lifespan, although the mechanisms underlying the effects of observed acute aerobic exercise on cognitive function may be age depen…
14535941	Marked disparity between age-related changes in dopamine and other presynaptic dopaminergic markers in human striatum.	aging	2003-11-??	Because age-related changes in brain dopaminergic innervation are assumed to influence human disorders involving dopamine (DA), we measured the levels of several presynpatic DAergic markers [DA, homovanillic acid, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT)] in post-mortem human striatum (caudate and putamen) from 56 neurologically normal subjects aged 1 day to 103 years. Striatal DA levels exhibited pronounced (2- to 3-fold) post-natal increases through adolescence and then decreases during aging. Similarly, TH and AADC increased almost 100% during the first 2 post-natal years; however, the levels of TH and, to a lesser extent, AADC then declined to adult levels by approximately 30 years of age. Although VMAT2 and DAT levels closely paralleled those of TH, resulting in relatively constant TH to transporter ratios during development and aging, a modest but significant decline (13%) in D…
19096119	Supplementation with CoQ10 lowers age-related (ar) NOX levels in healthy subjects.	aging	2008-??-??	Our work has identified an aging-related ECTO-NOX activity (arNOX), a hydroquinone oxidase which is cell surface located and generates superoxide. This activity increases with increasing age beginning >30 y. Because of its cell surface location and ability to generate superoxide, the arNOX proteins may serve to propagate an aging cascade both to adjacent cells and to oxidize circulating lipoproteins as significant factors determining atherogenic risk. The generation of superoxide by arNOX proteins is inhibited by Coenzyme Q10 as one basis for an anti-aging benefit of CoQ10 supplementation in human subjects. In a preliminary pilot study, 25 female subjects between 45 and 55 y of age were recruited at Stanford University from the Palo Alto, CA area. Informed consent was obtained. Ten of the subjects received Coenzyme Q10 supplementation of 180 (3 x 60 mg) per day for 28 days. Serum, saliva and perspiration levels of arNOX were determined at 7, 14 and 28 days of CoQ10 supplementation and …
20146609	Failure to engage spatial working memory contributes to age-related declines in visuomotor learning.	aging	2011-01-??	It is well documented that both cognitive and motor learning abilities decline with normative aging. Given that cognitive processes such as working memory are engaged during the early stages of motor learning [Anguera, J., Reuter-Lorenz, P., Willingham, D., & Seidler, R. Contributions of spatial working memory to visuomotor learning. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22(9), 1917-1930, 2010], age-related declines in motor learning may be due in part to reductions in cognitive ability. The present study examined whether age-related declines in spatial working memory (SWM) contribute to deficits in visuomotor adaptation. Young and older adult participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task that involved adapting manual aiming movements to a 30° rotation of the visual feedback display as well as an SWM task in an fMRI scanner. Young adults showed a steeper learning curve than older adults during the early adaptation period. The rate of early adaptation was correlated with SWM performa…
22980996	Effectiveness of nutritional supplementation on muscle mass in treatment of sarcopenia in old age: a systematic review.	aging	2013-01-??	BACKGROUND: Much interest has been focused on nutritional treatment of sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass and performance associated to aging; however, its benefits are unclear.    OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relevance of nutritional treatment of sarcopenia and assess the effects of supplementation on muscle mass and function within the aged population.    METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for controlled trials published between 1991 and 2012. We have assessed the quality, type of intervention, the cohort used, the way muscle mass was measured, and the outcomes of the various studies.    RESULTS: We have included 17 studies, with a total of 1287 patients, aged between 65 and 85 on average. An improvement in muscle mass was proven, whether measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis or dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and an improvement in strength was also proven.    CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation is effective in the treatment of sarcopenia in old age, and i…
90756	Age-dependent variability of ribosomal RNA-gene activity in man as determined from frequencies of silver staining nucleolus organizing regions on metaphase chromosomes of lymphocytes and fibroblasts.	aging	1979-08-??	Frequencies of silver staining nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) have been determined in lymphocytes and fibroblasts from very young and from aged persons. Since silver staining of NORs is associated with activity of ribosomal RNA-genes, we used this approach to investigate a possible inactivation of these genes during aging. Our lymphocyte data are based on a study per age-group of 220 metaphases from 10 subjects. Although in both age-groups modal numbers of silver staining chromosomes per metaphase had similar ranges over the subjects, the frequency of metaphases containing the maximal number of staining chromosomes was in the old age-group (80--89 years) significantly lower than in the young age-group (less than 1 year old). In fibroblasts, of which 75 metaphases from 4 subjects were included per age-group, differences were more pronounced. Modal numbers of silver staining chromosomes were for the aged persons (69--83 years) lower than for the young children (less than 1 year old)…
2560454	Different effects of aging on the opioid mechanisms controlling gonadotropin and cortisol secretion in man.	aging	1989-??-??	The present study was undertaken in order to assess the influence of aging on the endogenous opioid control of gonadotropin and adrenocorticotropin/cortisol secretion in man. For this purpose, the capability of the opioid antagonist naloxone to increase circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and cortisol was tested in male subjects of different ages. Thirty normal men were randomly chosen and divided into 3 groups by age: group I = 22-40 years (n = 10); group II = 41-59 years (n = 10); group III = 62-80 years (n = 10). Since the men of group III showed higher basal serum gonadotropin concentrations than the subjects of group I and group II, we selected from a large population a fourth group of elderly men with normal basal LH and FSH levels: group IV = 61-82 years (n = 7). All subjects were tested for 120 min during the intravenous administration of naloxone (4 mg given in an intravenous bolus at time 0, plus 10 mg infused for 2 h). Control t…
3553302	Human serum pancreatic lipase and trypsin 1 in aging: enzymatic and immunoenzymatic assays.	aging	1987-05-??	Two major human pancreatic proteins, lipase and trypsin I, were measured in human sera from 35 elderly healthy adults and 51 young healthy adults. Lipase enzymatic activity was determined by a turbidimetric assay in the presence of colipase; lipase immunoreactive protein and trypsin immunoreactive protein were measured by using immunoenzymatic assays. Serum levels of the pancreatic enzymes were similar in young and elderly adults, with no significant differences between the groups for any of the assays. There was a close correlation between lipase enzyme activity and immunoreactivity in all participants, suggesting that the catalytic activity of lipase was not affected by aging. There were also significant correlations between the levels of immunoreactive lipase protein and immunoreactive trypsin protein, within and between the two groups, suggesting an age-independent relationship between these two pancreatic enzymes.
23728979	Bioenergetics of exercising humans.	aging	2012-01-??	Human muscles, limbs and supporting ventilatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems are well adapted for walking, and there is reasonable transfer of efficiency of movement to bicycling. Our efficiency and economy of movement of bipedal walking (≈30%) are far superior to those of apes. This overall body efficiency during walking and bicycling represents the multiplicative interaction of a phosphorylative coupling efficiency of ≈60%, and a mechanical coupling efficiency of ≈50%. These coupling efficiencies compare well with those of other species adapted for locomotion. We are capable runners, but our speed and power are inferior to carnivorous and omnivorous terrestrial mammalian quadrupeds because of biomechanical and physiological constraints. But, because of our metabolic plasticity (i.e., the ability to switch among carbohydrate (CHO)- and lipid-derived energy sources) our endurance capacity is very good by comparison to most mammals, but inferior to highly adapted species such …
3713272	Protein carboxyl methyltransferase and methyl acceptor proteins in aging and cataractous tissue of the human eye lens.	aging	1986-03-??	We have studied the enzymatic modification of proteins in human eye lens tissue where these molecules can be long-lived and can be exposed to non-enzymatic degradation processes for periods of time up to the age of the individual. We have detected a protein carboxyl methyltransferase that is similar to enzymes from other mammalian tissues which appear to catalyze the methyl esterification of altered aspartyl residues, including D-aspartyl and beta-isomerized L-aspartyl residues, but which have no activity on normal L-aspartyl sites. Upon gel filtration of human lens extracts, we find protein substrates for the lens methyltransferase in each of the major soluble classes of protein. In comparing individual lenses of various ages, protein carboxyl methyltransferase activity was present in tissue from all normal and yellow cataractous lenses tested, but was present only at very low apparent levels in brunescent lens tissue. We find that the methyltransferase is much more highly saturated b…
170786	The formation of enlarged and giant mitochondria in the aging process of human hepatic cells.	aging	1975-07-??	Measurement of area, circumference and total length of membrane profile of mitochondria of hepatic cells in 61 human biopsy materials (age range 21 to 81 years) have been ultramicrometrically performed on electron micrographs, supplemented by electroncytochemical examination of cytochrome c oxidase activity in some cases. The mitochondria decreased in number after 60 years of age. The first stage of compensation for the numerical loss of mitochondria was achieved by an increase of cristae in each mitochondrion, followed with a five year lag by an increase in their size. Formation of enlarged and giant mitochondria in aging process following the significant decrease in their number, may be considered to be of similar mechanism to polyploidization of the nucleus, whose division is interfered.
22004282	Heparan sulfate affects elastin deposition in fibroblasts cultured from donors of different ages.	aging	2012-02-??	Heparan sulfate (HS), due to its presence on the cell surface and in the extracellular milieu and its ability to modulate cell signaling, has a fundamental role in both physiological and pathological conditions. For decades we have demonstrated the occurrence of interactions between glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and elastic fibers. In particular, we have recently shown that HS is present inside elastic fibers and plays a role in the assembly and stability of elastin coacervates. Elastin represents, within the extracellular matrix, the component most severely affected during aging, and changes in the synthesis and posttranslational modifications of HS have been described, possibly influencing cellular behavior and protein interactions. Thus, the present study has investigated, in two different in vitro experimental models, the role of HS on elastin deposition and assembly. Results demonstrate that: (1) Biological effects of HS are partly dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of t…
950050	Impaired Leydig cell reserve and altered serum androgen binding in the aging male.	aging	1976-07-??	The hormonal profile of the aging male reveals an associated decrease in free testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and increased luteinizing hormone levels. Later events consist of a decrease in total testosterone, stable DHT, and increased follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels. Although most available information supports the concept of impaired Leydig cell reserve, our study suggests some degree of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. The signal for increased androgen binding with age is not clear. There is a great deal of individual variation in the time of onset of these events.
17547711	Vitamin D status and parathyroid hormone levels in relation to blood pressure: a population-based study in older men and women.	aging	2007-06-??	BACKGROUND: Evidence is accumulating that the vitamin D endocrine system has physiological functions beyond bone health including a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Effects of poor vitamin D status on blood pressure may be mediated by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.    AIM: To evaluate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and PTH levels are independently associated with blood pressure in a population-based study of older men and women.    METHODS: Subjects were participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, aged 65 years and older. In 1205 participants, serum 25(OH)D and PTH levels were determined and diastolic and systolic blood pressure were measured. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for age, sex, region, season, lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake), and waist circumference.    RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D was not significantly associated with diastolic (beta 0.00, P = 0.98) or systolic (be…
20424800	Plasma very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and age-related hearing loss in older adults.	aging	2010-05-??	OBJECTIVES: Age-related hearing loss is a common social and health problem in the older adult population. Up until now, very little scientific attention has been given to the potential role of fatty acids in age-related hearing loss. In this study we investigated whether plasma very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with age-related hearing loss over three years.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional and 3-year longitudinal analyses.    SETTING: Wageningen, the Netherlands.    PARTICIPANTS: 720 men and postmenopausal women (50-70 years of age) without middle ear dysfunction or unilateral hearing loss.    MEASUREMENTS: Fatty acid proportions were measured in plasma cholesteryl esters. Hearing thresholds (in decibels, dB) at baseline and after three years were measured with pure-tone audiometry. Hearing loss was calculated as the increase in mean hearing thresholds in the low (0.5-kHz, 1-kHz, and 2-kHz) and high (4-kHz, 6-kHz, and 8-kHz) frequencies over three years.…
9226632	Abundance of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen and p21 mRNAs in fibroblasts cultured from fetal and postnatal dermis.	aging	1997-08-??	The steady-state abundance of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) procollagen mRNAs, p21Sdi1 mRNA, and beta-actin mRNA was determined in 29 skin fibroblast lines established from fetal, young and old donors. Donor ages ranged from 12 gestational weeks to nonagenarian. Adult donors were members of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The abundance of alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA was decreased in cell lines from both young and old donors compared with fetal lines. Additionally, one alpha 1(I) transcript observed in the fetal lines was not detected in postnatal lines. The abundance of alpha 1(III) procollagen mRNA was decreased in postnatal lines from old donors compared with fetal lines. The abundance of beta-actin mRNA was lower in postnatal lines from both young and old donors compared to fetal lines. These results suggest that cultures of fetal skin fibroblasts exhibit a greater capacity for synthesis of procollagens and beta-actin than postnatal lines. In contrast, the abundance of p21S…
11907709	Predictors of bone mineral density in aging healthy men varies by skeletal site.	aging	2002-03-??	Factors contributing to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in women are well defined. However, changes in bone mineral metabolism in aging men and the role of various factors in the pathogenesis of age-related bone loss in men are less well understood. To further clarify these changes, serum and urine biochemical parameters, and lumbar spine, hip, and total body bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated in a small sample of 45 healthy men aged 20-80 years, and multiple regression models were developed to predict age-related bone loss. Serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, creatinine clearance, osteocalcin, C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, log-free androgen index, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione decreased with age, and serum sex hormone binding globulin and urine total and free pyridinoline increased with age. Femoral neck BMD decreased with age, but remained stable at the other sites measured. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum phospha…
29038027	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and soluble TNF-alpha receptor responses in young vs. middle-aged males following eccentric exercise.	aging	2017-??-15	BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has been shown to be implicated in both muscle regeneration and muscle wasting. However, it remains unclear whether TNF-α is responsible for the age-related losses in muscle size and function. Also, due to the high clearance rate of TNF-α from circulation, analyzing the circulating levels of soluble TNF-α receptors 1 and 2 (STNFR1 and STNFR2) may provide a better indication of inflammatory events. The aim of this study was to examine changes in circulating concentrations of TNF-α, STNFR1, and STNFR2 following acute eccentric exercise in young (YA) and middle-aged (MA) men.    METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine YA (N=9, 21.8±2.2y, 179.5±4.9cm, 91.2±12.2kg, 21.8±4.3% body fat) and ten MA (N=10, 47.0±4.4y, 176.8±7.6cm; 96.0±21.5kg, 25.4±5.3% body fat) men completed an acute muscle damaging protocol (MDP). Blood samples were obtained at baseline (BL), immediately (IP), 30-minute (30P), 60-minute (60P), 120-minute (120P), 24-hour (24H), and 48-hour (…
16095668	Contribution of an affect-associated gene to human longevity: prevalence of the long-allele genotype of the serotonin transporter-linked gene in Japanese centenarians.	longevity	2005-11-??	Negative affect such as depression and anxiety has been reported to be associated with morbidity and mortality, and polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene may be associated with such affect disorders. Hypothesizing that 5HTT gene polymorphisms could influence human longevity via negative affect; we compared the polymorphic variation of the 5HTT gene between 265 Japanese centenarians and control subjects. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the 5HTT genotype and the physical, cognitive, and biologic status of centenarians, as indicated by the Barthel Index, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and serum albumin concentration, respectively. The frequency of the l/l genotype and the l allele was significantly greater in centenarians than in younger control subjects, particularly women. A significant effect of the 5HTT genotype on serum albumin concentration was observed in both sexes. Although, there was sex optionality, the l allele may carry a longevity adv…
7569294	Cholinergic modulation of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in normal aging.	aging	1995-09-??	Endocrine changes occur during the normal aging process. These include alterations in GH, TSH and, to a lesser extent, PRL secretion. Pyrodistigmine (PD) increases basal GH secretion in a widely variable manner and partially reverses the blunted GH response to GHRH found in elderly subjects. The aims of this study were to verify the finding of a paradoxical GH response to TRH (200 micrograms iv) and to evaluate the effect of priming with PD (120 mg orally) on basal and TRH-stimulated GH, TSH and PRL secretion in 7 euthyroid subjects (aged 75-96 years). Hormonal responses after control saline and PD were also evaluated. PD did not modify TSH or PRL responses to TRH. A slight increase in GH secretion was observed after PD. A clear-cut increase in GH levels after TRH was found in 4 out of 7 subjects. TRH-induced GH secretion was significantly increased by pretreatment with PD. Functional abnormalities in the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion in aging could explain, at least in part, …
11016537	Age-related dopamine D2/D3 receptor loss in extrastriatal regions of the human brain.	aging	????-??-??	Loss of dopamine D2-like receptors in the striatum has been associated with both normal human aging and impairment of cognitive and motor functions in the elderly. To investigate whether there are age-associated changes in dopamine D2 and D3 receptor subtypes (D2/3Rs) outside the striatum, a D2/3R selective high-affinity radioligand [11C]FLB 457 was used in positron emission tomography (PET) examinations for 24 normal healthy male subjects (age range 19-74 years). Significant age-related declines of D2/3Rs were detected in all the brain regions studied: the anterior cingulate cortex (decline of 13% per increase of a decade in age, P < 0.001). the frontal cortex (11%, P < 0.001), the lateral temporal cortex (10%, P < 0.001), the hippocampus (10%, P < 0.01), the medial temporal cortex (9%, P < 0.001), the amygdala (7%, P < 0.01), the medial thalamus (6%, P < 0.001) and the lateral thalamus (5%, P < 0.01). The rate of D2/3R decline was significantly faster in the frontal cortex as compare…
27189976	Socioeconomic inequalities in a 16-year longitudinal measurement of successful ageing.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: This study examines to what extent education, occupation and income are associated with the multidimensional process of successful ageing, encompassing trajectories of physical, mental and social functioning in old age.    METHODS: We employed 16-year longitudinal data from 2095 participants aged 55-85 years at baseline in the Dutch, nationally representative Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. For 9 indicators of successful ageing, separate Latent Class Growth models were used to identify subgroups of older adults with a 'successful' trajectory. A 'Successful Aging Index' expressed the number of indicators for which individual respondents had a successful trajectory (range 0-9). Using multivariate regression models, we investigated associations between socioeconomic position and the Successful Ageing Index, and with separate indicators of successful ageing.    RESULTS: Higher education, occupational skill level and income were independently associated with higher numbers o…
6097322	Increased DNA topoisomerase I activity in aging human cell chromatin.	aging	1984-10-??	Chromatin-associated DNA topoisomerase I activity was measured in human diploid fibroblasts during in vitro aging. No difference was detected as a function of cell age in the nicking and the closing activities of the DNA-unwinding enzyme. The capacity of type-I topoisomerase to relax superhelical DNA molecules was, however, increased in aged cells. An age-related increase in nucleoprotein content was also observed.
23601089	Tracking and fixed ranking of leukocyte telomere length across the adult life course.	longevity	2013-08-??	Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with atherosclerosis in adults and diminished survival in the elderly. LTL dynamics are defined by LTL at birth, which is highly variable, and its age-dependent attrition thereafter, which is rapid during the first 20 years of life. We examined whether age-dependent LTL attrition during adulthood can substantially affect individuals' LTL ranking (e.g., longer or shorter LTL) in relation to their peers. We measured LTL in samples donated 12 years apart on average by 1156 participants in four longitudinal studies. We observed correlations of 0.91-0.96 between baseline and follow-up LTLs. Ranking individuals by deciles revealed that 94.1% (95% confidence interval of 92.6-95.4%) showed no rank change or a 1 decile change over time. We conclude that in adults, LTL is virtually anchored to a given rank with the passage of time. Accordingly, the links of LTL with atherosclerosis and longevity appear to be established early in life. It is unl…
7226658	The effect of age and sex on bone density, bone mineral content and cortical index.	aging	1981-05-??	The density of cancellous bone in the nondominant radius of healthy subjects has been observed by the Compton scattering method as a function of age and sex. The average density for males is higher than for females. In males the density does not change up to the age of 80 years, while in females the density decreases beginning at age 50. A significant decrease in the bone mineral content of the distal radius is observed at earlier ages as measured by the Cameron-Sorenson technique. The average value of the cortical index of the third metacarpal shows some difference between the sexes over the age of 50, the index in males being higher than in the females. Between 30 and 50 years the female cortical index is greater than in the males. Little correlation was found among the three parameters studied, suggesting that they measure different phases of the pathophysiological processes involved in aging bone.
6493283	Relative contributions of aging and estrogen deficiency to postmenopausal bone loss.	aging	1984-11-15	Debate continues on whether aging or estrogen deficiency is the more important determinant of postmenopausal bone loss. We compared 14 women who had undergone oophorectomy during young adulthood, 14 normal perimenopausal women, and 14 normal postmenopausal women (mean ages, 54, 52, and 73 years, respectively; mean duration of estrogen deficiency, 22, 0.3, and 22 years, respectively). Bone mineral density was assessed by single-photon and dual-photon absorptiometry. As compared with the perimenopausal group, the other two groups had significantly lower bone mineral density at the midradius, femoral neck, femoral intertrochanteric area, and lumbar spine (-15 per cent, -25 per cent, -16 per cent, and -23 per cent, respectively, in the oophorectomized group and -18 per cent, -28 per cent, -26 per cent, and -23 per cent, respectively, in the postmenopausal group). Because bone loss in the oophorectomized group (differing from the perimenopausal group in menopausal status but not in age) was…
7300456	Properties of DNA polymerases from young and ageing human fibroblasts.	lifespan	1981-??-??	A comparison was made between two methods of isolating DNA polymerases from MRC-5 fibroblasts. The first method produces DNA polymerase-alpha with a lower molecular weight and other properties that are not normally found for this enzyme. It was concluded that this method produces proteolytically degraded DNA polymerase-alpha. A second method was developed which produces DNA polymerase-alpha with all the normal properties of this enzyme. The specific activity of DNA polymerase was reduced in senescent MRC-5 fibroblasts approximately 2--4-fold. DNA polymerase-alpha accounts for 95% of polymerase activity in young cells and its specific activity during the fibroblast lifespan correlates with the declining cellular growth rate. DNA polymerase-beta is present at 0.3-3% of total cellular activity and its specific activity does not correlate with cellular growth rate. DNA polymerase-gamma accounts for 5% of the polymerase activity in young cells and 20% in old cells. However, the specific act…
7086074	Methodologically critical interactions of circadian rhythm, sex, and aging characterize serum aldosterone and the female adrenopause.	longevity	1982-07-??	Nine 20- to 26-year-old and ten 70- to 78-year-old diurnally active, nocturnally resting women in Würzburg, Federal Republic of Germany, gave blood at 0700, 1000, 1300, 1600, 1900, and 2200 for radioimmunoassay of aldosterone. Single and population-mean cosinors were applied. A multivariate analysis of circadian rhythm characteristics revealed effects of age on the amplitude (p = .003) but not the mesor of aldosterone in women (i.e., the age effect could only be detected at certain circadian times but not at others). No change with age was found for concomitantly sampled men. Statistically significant interactions among circadian time, age, and sex (p = .001) establish the adrenocorticopause in women and suggest that it may occur earlier in women than in men, in keeping with similar results on serum cortisol in the same subjects. This phenomenon awaits scrutiny from the viewpoint of its bearing on longevity and life quality. These results also indicate the importance of assessing chron…
26918290	Temporal Trend in Androgen Status and Androgen-Sensitive Outcomes in Older Men.	aging	2016-??-??	CONTEXT: Although androgen status decreases with aging in unselected men, the contemporaneous relationship over time between circulating hormones and androgen-sensitive outcomes has not been reported.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal relationships between age-specific androgen status and muscle (mass, strength), hemoglobin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).    DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Men aged 70 years and older from the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project study were assessed at baseline (2005–2007; n = 1705) and at 2-year (n = 1367) and 5-year follow-up (n = 958).    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At all assessments, serum T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and serum SHBG, LH, and FSH were measured by immunoassay together with calculation of free T (cFT). Muscle mass, strength of upper (hand grip) and lower (walking speed) limbs, hemoglobin, and prostate size (serum PSA) were…
20572889	Maintenance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system activity correlates with visible skin benefits.	longevity, lifespan	2010-12-??	Researches on longevity and anti-ageing molecules have clearly evidenced the potential to increase lifespan of the cells. These recent scientific data raise interests and questions on the capacity of the cells to live longer and maintain their fundamental mechanisms of protection, reparation or degradation of abnormal proteins to maintain their capital of healthy and functional cellular activity. In this concern, this study was focused on the ubiquitin-proteasome system as an essential cellular tool to maintain the pool of functionally active proteins allowing renewal of proteins and degradation of damaged proteins. As the proteasome keeps the 'cells health capital', it should be particularly interesting to associate the maintenance of the proteasome activity with increasing longevity. Indeed, although oxidative stress damage increases with ageing leading to collagen and cellular membrane alterations, it also leads to a reduction in the proteasome activity which is critical for the cel…
30095063	Protein and bone health across the lifespan.	lifespan	2019-??-??	Bone health is determined by the rate of accrual in early life, followed by the rate of age-associated bone loss. Dietary protein intake might have a role in bone health across both of these phases via pleiotropic mechanistic pathways. Herein we summarise the pathways through which protein may exert either a positive or negative influence on bone. In the introduction, we describe the acid-ash hypothesis, which states that a high-protein intake may lead to an acidic residue that must be neutralised through the leaching of calcium and other minerals from the bone, subsequently leading to demineralisation and bone weakening. Conversely, and as described in the 'Against: mechanisms through which protein may negatively impact bone' section, protein intake may act to strengthen the bone by stimulating the activity of various anabolic hormones and growth factors, or by optimising muscle mass and functionality, which itself has an osteogenic influence. The net effect of these contrasting pathw…
6581489	Aging and cortisol resistance to suppression by dexamethasone: a positive correlation.	aging	1983-10-??	Cortisol resistance to suppression by 0.5 mg of dexamethasone given at 11 p.m. was studied in 30 normal subjects, 17 to 78 years of age. Serum cortisol concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. A strong positive correlation was found between age and cortisol concentrations 9 hours after dexamethasone administration. The data suggest that aging, per se, might contribute to the increased cortisol resistance to suppression by dexamethasone reported in depression and dementia.
27934653	Leucine and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin-Dependent Activation of Muscle Protein Synthesis in Aging.	aging	2016-12-??	The preservation or restoration of muscle mass is of prime importance for healthy aging. However, aging has been repeatedly shown to be associated with resistance of muscle to the anabolic effects of feeding. Leucine supplementation has been proposed as a possible strategy because of its regulatory role on protein homeostasis. Indeed, it acts independently of growth factors and leads to enhanced cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation and increased protein synthesis. Leucine acts as a signaling molecule directly at the muscle level via the activation of mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, in aged muscle, mTORC1 activation seems to be impaired, with decreased sensitivity and responsiveness of muscle protein synthesis to amino acids, whereas the phosphorylation state of several components of this signaling pathway appears to be higher in the basal state. This may stem from specific age-related impairment of muscle signaling and from decreased nutrient…
15731261	Long-term cytomegalovirus infection leads to significant changes in the composition of the CD8+ T-cell repertoire, which may be the basis for an imbalance in the cytokine production profile in elderly persons.	aging	2005-03-??	In spite of the present belief that latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection drives CD8+ T-cell differentiation and induces premature immune senescence, no systematic studies have so far been performed to compare phenotypical and functional changes in the CD8+ T-cell repertoire in CMV-infected and noninfected persons of different age groups. In the present study, number, cytokine production, and growth potential of naive (CD45RA+ CD28+), memory (CD45RA- CD28+), and effector (CD45RA+ CD28- or CD45RA- CD28-) CD8+ T cells were analyzed in young, middle-aged, and elderly clinically healthy persons with a positive or negative CMV antibody serology. Numbers and functional properties of CMVpp65(495-503)-specific CD8+ T cells were also studied. We demonstrate that aging as well as CMV infection lead to a decrease in the size of the naive CD8+ T-cell pool but to an increase in the number of CD8+ effector T cells, which produce gamma interferon but lack substantial growth potential. The size of th…
21751096	Functional neuroimaging studies in normal aging.	aging	2012-??-??	With an expanding aging population, it is increasingly important to gain a better understanding of the changes in cognition and neural integrity that occur in normal aging. The advent of non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques has spurred researchers to examine cognition and neural functioning in healthy older adults. A significant amount of research has been produced since this time and has led to influential theories of aging such as the hemispheric asymmetry reduction for older adults (HAROLD) model and the compensatory recruitment hypothesis. This chapter discusses advances in our understanding of normal aging achieved through the use of functional neuroimaging. Research examining age-related changes in domains such as attention, memory, and executive functioning, as well as imaging of the resting-state and the influences of genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype), are discussed. In conclusion, limitations of the current literature and important avenues for future resear…
2387759	Sex, intimacy, and the aging process.	aging	1990-??-??	The loss of sexuality is not an inevitable aspect of aging, and the majority of healthy people remain sexually active on a regular basis until advanced old age. However, the aging process does bring with it certain changes in the physiology of the male and the female sexual response, and these along with a number of medical problems that become more prevalent in the mature years, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the sexual disorders of the elderly. The typical patient over 50 has only a partial degree of biological impairment, which has, however, been escalated into a total sexual disability by a variety of cultural, intrapsychic, and relationship stressors. Fortunately, these problems are frequently amenable to an integrated psychodynamically oriented sex therapy approach that emphasizes the improvement of the couple's intimacy, and the expansion of their sexual flexibility.
10670554	Associations of light, moderate, and vigorous intensity physical activity with longevity. The Harvard Alumni Health Study.	longevity	2000-02-01	Physical activity is associated with better health; however, the optimal intensity of activity remains unclear. A total of 13,485 men (mean age, 57.5 years) from the Harvard Alumni Health Study reported their walking, stair climbing, and sports/recreation in 1977. Between 1977 and 1992, 2,539 died. After adjusting for the different activity components, distance walked and storeys climbed independently predicted longevity (p, trend = 0.004 and <0.001, respectively). Light activities (<4 multiples of resting metabolic rate (METs)) were not associated with reduced mortality rates, moderate activities (4-<6 METs) appeared somewhat beneficial, and vigorous activities (> or =6 METs) clearly predicted lower mortality rates (p, trend = 0.72, 0.07, and <0.001, respectively). These data provide some support for current recommendations that emphasize moderate intensity activity; they also clearly indicate a benefit of vigorous activity.
12243757	Telomerase rescues the expression levels of keratinocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-II in senescent human fibroblasts.	aging	2002-10-01	Changes in expression levels of various cytokines, growth factors, and related genes were examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in a normal human fibroblast cell strain, TIG-3, along with in vitro aging. The expression levels of KGF and IGF-II were decreased with proliferative aging but not by growth arrest of young cells. In telomere-elongated cells prepared by transfection with human telomerase reverse transcriptase cDNA, high expression levels of these two genes were maintained, suggesting a causal relation between telomere shortening and reduced expression of KGF and IGF-II. The expression level of HGF was high in both growing and growth-arrested young cells but low in both senescent and telomere-elongated cells. The expression levels of follistatin and HB-EGF were high in both young growing and telomere-elongated cells but low in both senescent and growth-arrested young cells, indicating a growth-dependent expression. Expression levels of FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF, …
9187481	Developmental and aging changes in the expression of amyloid precursor protein in Down syndrome brains.	aging	1997-06-??	We studied immunohistochemically the expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the frontal lobes of 18 Down syndrome (DS) patients (20 gestation weeks (GW) to 50 years) and 15 controls (17 GW to 50 years) using six purified antibodies against the secretory forms (N-terminal, N-Amy and Amy540), the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain, residues 1-28 of beta protein (Affi28), and the carboxyl-terminal fragment (Ac) of APP. In the cortex of fetuses, neonates and infants, immunoreactivity for N-Amy and Ac was observed in both neurons and glial cells, and that for Affi28 in glial cells in the subpial layer in both DS patients and controls suggesting the functioning role of APP was a growth factor. This immunoreactivity disappeared in childhood and reappeared in adulthood in only DS patients. The earlier reappearance of those in DS patients from a young adult age than in normal controls may result from a gene dosage effect, since APP is encoded on chromosome 21. The N-Amy,…
12713590	Topical N-acetyl cysteine and genistein prevent ultraviolet-light-induced signaling that leads to photoaging in human skin in vivo.	aging	2003-05-??	Human skin is exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation damages human skin and results in an old and wrinkled appearance, called photoaging. We have previously reported that molecular mechanisms by which ultraviolet light causes photoaging involve activation of growth factor and cytokine receptors in keratinocytes and dermal cells. They lead to downstream signal transduction through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase, and p38) pathways. These signaling pathways converge in the nucleus of cells to form an activated complex of transcription factor activator protein 1 (cFos/cJun), which induces matrix metalloproteinases that degrade skin connective tissue. In addition to cell surface receptor activation, generation of reactive oxygen species by ultraviolet radiation is believed to be critical in triggering mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We investigated the ability of (i) ult…
9315457	Lifespan changes in the human hypothalamus.	aging	????-??-??	The various cell groups in the human hypothalamus show different patterns of aging, which are the basis for changes in biological rhythms, hormone production, autonomic functions, and behavior. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the clock of the brain, exhibits circadian and seasonal rhythms in vasopressin synthesis that are disrupted later in life. Furthermore, the age-related sexual differences in the number of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons in this nucleus reinforces the idea that the SCN is not only involved in the timing of circadian rhythms but also in the temporal organization of reproductive functions. The sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic are (SDN-POA), or intermediate nucleus, is twice as large in men as in women, a difference that arises between the ages of two to four years and puberty. During aging a dramatic, sex-dependent decrease in cell number occurs, leading to values which are only 10-15% of the cell number found in early childhood. The vasopressi…
12773944	Diagnosis of partial androgen deficiency in the aging male.	aging	2003-04-??	From the age of 30 yrs on, the (free) testosterone [(F)T] levels decrease continuously with age, mean total T level at age 70 yrs, being only 2/3rds of the mean level at age 25 yrs, whereas mean FT level is only 40% of the mean level in young adults. However, inter-individual variations are wide and whereas at least 30% of men over age 70 yrs have clearly subnormal (F)T levels, 20% have still levels in the upper range of values in young men. Aging in males is accompanied by a series of signs and symptoms, reminiscent of androgen deficiency in young adults, such as decrease in muscle mass and strength, increase in abdominal, mainly visceral, fat with insulin resistance and atherogenic lipid profile, decrease in libido and sexual hair, osteopenia, decrease in cognitive performances, insomnia, excessive sweating and decrease in general well-being, and it is tempting to relate these symptoms to the age associated decrease in androgen levels, the more that often a significant, albeit genera…
3826098	Asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Risks and consequences in the Normative Aging Study.	aging	1987-03-??	To quantify the consequences of asymptomatic hyperuricemia, this study examined rates for a first episode of gouty arthritis based on 30,147 human-years of prospective observation. A cohort of 2,046 initially healthy men in the Normative Aging Study was followed for 14.9 years with serial examinations and measurement of urate levels. With prior serum urate levels of 9 mg/dl or more, the annual incidence rate of gouty arthritis was 4.9 percent, compared with 0.5 percent for urate levels of 7.0 to 8.9 mg/dl and 0.1 percent for urate levels below 7.0 mg/dl. With urate levels of 9 mg/dl or higher, cumulative incidence of gouty arthritis reached 22 percent after five years. Incidence rates were three times higher for hypertensive patients than for normotensive patients (p less than 0.01). The strongest predictors of gout in a proportional hazards model were age, body mass index, hypertension, and cholesterol level, and alcohol intake. When the serum urate level became a factor in the model,…
16024519	Lower capillarization, VEGF protein, and VEGF mRNA response to acute exercise in the vastus lateralis muscle of aged vs. young women.	aging	2005-11-??	In humans, the majority of studies demonstrate an age-associated reduction in the number of capillaries surrounding skeletal muscle fibers; however, recent reports in rats suggest that muscle capillarization is well maintained with advanced age. In sedentary and trained men, aging lowers the number of capillaries surrounding type II, but not type I, skeletal muscle fibers. The fiber type-specific effect of aging on muscle capillarization is unknown in women. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important in the basal maintenance of skeletal muscle capillarization, and lower VEGF expression is associated with increased age in nonskeletal muscle tissue of women. Compared with young women (YW), we hypothesized that aged women (AW) would demonstrate 1) lower muscle capillarization in a fiber type-specific manner and 2) lower VEGF and VEGF receptor expression at rest and in response to acute exercise. Nine sedentary AW (70 + 8 yr) and 11 YW (22 + 3 yr) had vastus lateralis muscle bi…
6194068	The acid phosphatase activity in lymphocytes with regard to the ontogenetic development of man.	aging	1983-??-??	In 120 healthy subjects aged from 1 day of life to 90 years the activity and intracellular localization of acid phosphatase (AP) in the peripheral blood lymphocytes has been evaluated by using semiquantitative cytochemical method (Barka and Anderson 1962). The long lasting stability of the lysosomal apparatus of lymphocytes during the ontogenetic development between the first day of life and the fifth decade of life has been stated. The stability was expressed by relatively constant number of lymphocytes containing intact AP-positive lysosomal granules. During the last decades of life between 66 and 90 year lymphocyte lysosomes are destabilized and numerous cells with cytoplasmatic diffusion of the enzyme can be observed. According to the author's opinion the above phenomenon corresponds to the aging of the lymphocyte system.
15287158	The menopause and sexual functioning: a review of the population-based studies.	aging	2003-??-??	Sexual problems are among the most frequently presented health concerns of women attending menopause clinics. We examine rigorous observational studies of the menopausal transition to determine whether there are changes in sexual functioning associated with the menopausal transition and the relative roles of aging and hormonal factors. We detail the methodological limitations of menopause research. We then review studies documenting the effects of aging on women's sexual functioning prior to reviewing studies that document both aging and menopausal status. These latter studies are divided into both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. In summary, there is an age-related decline in sexual functioning but an added incremental decline associated with the menopausal transition. There have been relatively few studies that have been prospective, population-based, utilised a validated measure of sexual functioning, and carried out concurrent hormonal sampling. The Melbourne Women's Midli…
19109513	Relationship of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity to age and cognition.	aging	2008-12-24	Past research has demonstrated that performance on frontal lobe-dependent tasks is associated with dopamine system integrity and that various dopamine system deficits occur with aging. The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FMT) is a substrate of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Studies using 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) (another AADC substrate) to measure how striatal PET signal and age relate have had inconsistent outcomes. The varying results occur in part from tracer processing that renders FDOPA signal subject to aspects of postrelease metabolism, which may themselves change with aging. In contrast, FMT remains a purer measure of AADC function. We used partial volume-corrected FMT PET scans to measure age-related striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in 21 older (mean, 66.9) and 16 younger (mean, 22.8) healthy adults. We also investigated how striatal FMT signal related to a cognitive measure of fro…
19164775	Complexity of force output during static exercise in individuals with Down syndrome.	aging	2009-04-??	Force variability is greater in individuals with Down syndrome (DS) compared with persons without DS and is similar to that seen with normal aging. The purpose of this study was to examine the structure (in both time and frequency domains) of force output variability in persons with DS to determine whether deficits in force control are similar between individuals with DS and older adults. An isometric handgrip task at a constant force (30% of maximal voluntary contraction) was completed by individuals with DS (n = 29, age 26 yr), and healthy young (n = 26, age 27 yr) and older (n = 33, age 70 yr) individuals. Mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were used to analyze the magnitude of force output variability. Spectral analysis and approximate entropy (ApEn) were used to analyze the structure of force output variability. Mean force output for DS was lower than in young controls (P < 0.05) but no different from old controls. Individuals with DS had greater SD a…
7410763	Effects of aging on hydroxyproline in human heart muscle.	aging	1980-09-??	Hydroxyproline concentration in the NaCl-soluble, TCA-soluble, and residual fractions of heart muscle was chemically determined in 40 autopsy subjects (25 men and 15 women), to study the effects of aging. In the left ventricle, the total hydroxyproline content of the endocardium and papillary muscle increased significantly in relation to age; the increase was greatest in the TCA-soluble fraction, followed by the residual fraction. Statistical analysis revealed that hydroxyproline in the residual fraction increased from the epicardium to the endocardium and then to the papillary muscle. Significant negative correlations were found between heart weight and total hydroxyproline in the epicardium and endocardium. In the right ventricle, a significant negative correlation was noted between heart weight and total hydroxyproline content. Though no correlations were evident between age and hydroxyproline content in females, significant correlations were observed between age and the total hydro…
11119396	Association of hypogonadism and estradiol levels with bone mineral density in elderly men from the Framingham study.	aging	2000-12-19	BACKGROUND: Both hypogonadism and low estrogen levels adversely affect bone health in young men. In elderly men, who are at greatest risk for osteoporotic fracture, the influence of hypogonadism on bone mineral density remains unclear, as does the relative effect of estrogen status compared to hypogonadism.    OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation of hypogonadism and estrogen status to bone mineral density in elderly men.    DESIGN: Community-based, prospective cohort study.    SETTING: Framingham, Massachusetts.    PATIENTS: Male participants of the Framingham Study.    MEASUREMENTS: Total testosterone, total estradiol, and luteinizing hormone were measured in participants at all four biennial examinations from 1981 to 1989. Values from at least three of four examinations were averaged. Hypogonadism was defined as a mean testosterone level less than 10.4 nmol/L (<3.0 ng/mL) or a mean luteinizing hormone level of 20 IU/L or greater. An alternate definition of hypogonadism based only on a …
7838296	Age-associated changes of pituitary-adrenocortical hormone regulation in humans: importance of gender.	aging	????-??-??	In the present study the hypothesis was tested that in normal human aging an insensitivity of the glucocorticoid feedback signals is acquired. Thus, 40 healthy elderly (mean age: 69 +/- 5 years) and 20 younger (mean age: 34 +/- 8 years) individuals underwent a combined dexamethasone suppression/CRH-stimulation test. Cortisol secretion after dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment and before CRH was increased in the older age group, but none of the subjects escaped DEX-induced suppression of cortisol. However, after additional CRH administration to the DEX-pretreated volunteers, the older group released significantly more cortisol than their young counterparts. Within the group of the elderly only, a positive correlation between BASAL, DEX-pretreated cortisol concentration and post-CRH steroid responses was found. Gender profoundly affected DEX/CRH-test outcome: females, regardless of age, had an increased hormonal secretion in comparison to males. It is concluded that, during human aging, ada…
8599321	Comparison of biochemical indexes for assessing vitamin K nutritional status in a healthy adult population.	aging	1996-04-??	Biochemical indexes for assessing vitamin K nutritional status were evaluated in 263 healthy subjects (127 males, 136 females) aged 18-85 y. The influences of aging (stratified by decade), menopause, and sex were examined. Total, carboxylated, and undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentrations were affected by sex and aging with increases in the sixth decade in women attributed to menopause. Aging effects in the women and sex differences were eliminated when undercarboxylated osteocalcin was expressed as a percentage of the total. Plasma phylloquinone and undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II) concentrations varied little with aging with the exception of lower concentrations of phylloquinone in women in their third decade compared with other ages and higher concentrations of PIVKA-II in younger males compared with younger females. Urinary gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-creatinine excretion ratios increased significantly with age in both males (r = 0.68, P < 0.001) and females (r = 0.…
6687615	Effect of aging on 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels in normotensive and essential hypertensive males.	aging	1983-03-??	Prostacyclin (PGI2) is produced in the vessel wall and acts as a vasodilator hormone. Measurement of plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is considered to be an index of PGI2 production. In the present study the effects of aging on the plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were studied in 64 normotensive and 48 essential hypertensive males. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, i.e., young (24-39 years), middle-aged (40-55 years) and elderly (over 56 years) groups. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was measured by specific radioimmunoassay after silicic acid column chromatographic purification. The 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were lower in elderly normotensive males (10.3 +/- 1.4 pg/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 12) than in normotensive young males (15.3 +/- 2.3, n = 30, p less than 0.05). The plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels in hypertensive elderly males (10.6 +/- 1.3 pg/ml, n = 10) is lower than in hypertensive young males (19.8 +/- 2.2, n = 17, p less than 0.01). These results indicate that the plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha…
22189385	Ovarian primordial and nongrowing follicle counts according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system.	aging	2012-02-??	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the ovarian primordial and nongrowing follicle number according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system as defined by menstrual cycle characteristics.    METHODS: Normal ovaries were collected from 63 women (age 26-52 y) undergoing oophorectomy for benign indications. Before surgical operation, each participant completed a detailed questionnaire collecting information regarding menstrual cycle characteristics and was classified by bleeding patterns into STRAW stages -4, -3, -2, and -1. A single ovary was selected for the determination of ovarian primordial and total nongrowing follicle number using a validated fractionator/optical disector method. A subset of the participants (n = 43) underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination for the determination of the ovarian antral follicle count and serum measurements of follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, antimüllerian hormone, and inhibin B. All measurement…
29035968	The final word on nutritional screening and assessment in older persons.	aging	2018-01-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an updated perspective of how nutritional screening and assessment in older persons should be performed and reasonably implemented in the near future.    RECENT FINDINGS: Although nutritional screening and assessment should be fast and easy procedures, there is increasing evidence that more time should be dedicated to them. This is probably an answer to the claim to a medicine being more preventive than curative. Increasing interest is currently given to healthy aging and nutritional status is more likely to be addressed for its implications on functional status and disability. Important prognostic conditions, such as frailty, sarcopenia, and cachexia, which are closely linked to the nutritional domain, are at the top of the agenda. Therefore, body composition is a key issue and functional status is suggested as primary endpoint of nutrition trials. In this scenario, there is also a rationale for systematic assessment of inflammation, protein intake, and v…
27259001	Telomere Length, Long-Term Black Carbon Exposure, and Cognitive Function in a Cohort of Older Men: The VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Long-term air pollution exposure has been associated with age-related cognitive impairment, possibly because of enhanced inflammation. Leukocytes with longer telomere length (TL) are more responsive to inflammatory stimuli, yet TL has not been evaluated in relation to air pollution and cognition.    OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether TL modifies the association of 1-year exposure to black carbon (BC), a marker of traffic-related air pollution, with cognitive function in older men, and we examined whether this modification is independent of age and of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation.    METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, we conducted 1-3 cognitive examinations of 428 older men in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Normative Aging Study. We used covariate-adjusted repeated-measure logistic regression to estimate associations of 1-year BC exposure with relative odds of being a low scorer (≤ 25) on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a proxy of poor cognition…
12882351	Asymmetry of DNA replication fork progression in Werner's syndrome.	aging	2002-10-??	Human aging is associated with accumulation of cells that have undergone replicative senescence. The rare premature aging Werner's syndrome (WS) provides a phenocopy of normal human aging and WS patient cells recapitulate the aging phenotype in culture as they rapidly lose the ability to proliferate or replicate their DNA. WS is associated with loss of functional WRN protein. Although the biochemical properties of WRN protein, which possesses both helicase and exonuclease activities, suggest an involvement in DNA metabolism, its action in cells is not clear. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a role of the WRN protein in DNA replication in normally proliferating cells. Most importantly, we demonstrate that in the absence of functional WRN protein, replication forks from origins of bidirectional replication fail to progress normally, resulting in marked asymmetry of bidirectional forks. We propose that WRN acts in normal DNA replication to prevent collapse of replication forks o…
29910802	Parameters of the Immune System and Vitamin D Levels in Old Individuals.	longevity, aging	2018-??-??	Aim: The increased number of individuals older than 80 years, centenarians, and supercentenarians is not a synonym for healthy aging, since severe infections, hospitalization, and disability are frequently observed. In this context, a possible strategy is to preserve the main characteristics/functions of the immune system with the aim to cause less damage to the organism during the aging process. Vitamin D acts on bone marrow, brain, breast, malignant cells, and immune system and has been recommended as a supplement. We aimed to evaluate whether immune parameters and vitamin D serum levels are correlated.    Methods: We evaluated some features of the immune system using the peripheral blood of individuals older than 80 years ( = 12) compared to young subjects ( = 10). In addition, we correlated these findings with vitamin D serum levels.    Results: Old individuals presented metabolic parameters of healthy aging and maintained preserved some features of immunity such as CD4/CD8 ratio, …
11994368	Sex- and age-related changes in epitestosterone in relation to pregnenolone sulfate and testosterone in normal subjects.	lifespan	2002-05-??	Epitestosterone has been demonstrated to act at various levels as a weak antiandrogen. So far, its serum levels have been followed up only in males. Epitestosterone and its major circulating precursor pregnenolone sulfate and T were measured in serum from 211 healthy women and 386 men to find out whether serum concentrations of epitestosterone are sufficient to exert its antiandrogenic actions. In women, epitestosterone exhibited a maximum around 20 yr of age, followed by a continuous decline up to menopause and by a further increase in the postmenopause. In men, maximum epitestosterone levels were detected at around 35 yr of age, followed by a continuous decrease. Pregnenolone sulfate levels in women reached their maximum at about age 32 yr and then declined continuously, and in males the maximum was reached about 5 yr earlier and then remained nearly constant. Epitestosterone correlated with pregnenolone sulfate only in males. In both sexes a sharp decrease of the epitestosterone/T r…
6420443	Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus of women: effects of age and reproductive status.	aging	1984-03-??	In the study of the effects of age and reproductive status on LHRH and TRH content in the hypothalamus of women, we found that the amount of LHRH (58 +/- 5.5 ng; mean +/- SE) in the hypothalamus of young women (16-29 yr) was significantly greater (P less than 0.001) than that (28 +/- 3.0 ng) in postmenopausal women (50-78 yr). The hypothalamic content of LHRH (18 +/- 2.4 ng) of bilaterally ovariectomized women (39-47 yr) was significantly less (P less than 0.001) than that (60 +/- 12.6 ng) in younger ovulatory women (30-39 yr) or that (56 +/- 13.5 ng) in ovulatory women of comparable age (40-49 yr). In contrast, the hypothalamic content of TRH (121.4 +/- 32.8 ng) in postmenopausal women were similar to that (122.3 +/- 12.5 ng) in young women. Although aging in women is associated with a significant reduction in the amount of LHRH in the hypothalamus, such a reduction appears to be a consequence of ovarian failure and not of aging per se.
24465738	Aging of non-visual spectral sensitivity to light in humans: compensatory mechanisms?	aging	2014-??-??	The deterioration of sleep in the older population is a prevalent feature that contributes to a decrease in quality of life. Inappropriate entrainment of the circadian clock by light is considered to contribute to the alteration of sleep structure and circadian rhythms in the elderly. The present study investigates the effects of aging on non-visual spectral sensitivity to light and tests the hypothesis that circadian disturbances are related to a decreased light transmittance. In a within-subject design, eight aged and five young subjects were exposed at night to 60 minute monochromatic light stimulations at 9 different wavelengths (420-620 nm). Individual sensitivity spectra were derived from measures of melatonin suppression. Lens density was assessed using a validated psychophysical technique. Although lens transmittance was decreased for short wavelength light in the older participants, melatonin suppression was not reduced. Peak of non-visual sensitivity was, however, shifted to …
21350248	Sex differences in age trajectories of physiological dysregulation: inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and allostatic load.	longevity	2011-05-??	There is a paucity of knowledge from population data about sex differences and their age variation in physiological determinants of longevity. This study fills this gap using nationally representative samples of 38,000 individuals aged 17+ from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-2006). It examines sex differences in the age trajectories of 14 markers of physiological functions across multiple systems and three summary indices including inflammation burden, metabolic syndrome, and allostatic load. Statistical analyses show substantial sex differences, age variations, and sex by age interaction effects for all variables examined. These patterns remain robust after adjustment of risk factors and shed light on the biological base of the reduction of sex difference in mortality in the post-reproductive life span.
23124623	Age-related effect of serotonin transporter genotype on amygdala and prefrontal cortex function in adolescence.	aging	2014-02-??	The S and LG alleles of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) lower serotonin transporter expression. These low-expressing alleles are linked to increased risk for depression and brain activation patterns found in depression (increased amygdala activation and decreased amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity). Paradoxically, serotonin transporter blockade relieves depression symptoms. Rodent models suggest that decreased serotonin transporter in early life produces depression that emerges in adolescence, whereas decreased serotonin transporter that occurs later in development ameliorates depression. However, no brain imaging research has yet investigated the moderating influence of human development on the link between 5-HTTLPR and effect-related brain function. We investigated the age-related effect of 5-HTTLPR on amygdala activation and amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity using a well-replicated probe, an emotional face task, in children and adolescents a…
6101319	The neuroendocrine system and aging.	aging	1980-??-??	The course of aging in most endocrine glands is moderately well documented in man, but is somewhat less understood in the rat. With increasing age in man there is a significant decline in the secretion of hormones by the thyroid, adrenal cortex, testis and ovary; pituitary growth hormone falls but gonadotrophins rise. In man decline in the secretion of testicular and ovarian steroids appears to be due to primary age changes in the gonads, whereas in the rat age changes in the central regulatory mechanisms appear to be responsible for gonadal aging. Such findings have led to the formulation of a number of neuroendocrine theories of aging, which explain peripheral aging on the basis of an aging clock in the brain, primary age changes in neurotransmitter metabolism, age changes in the hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid, or in the regulatory actions of these glands.
9871092	123I-5-I-R91150, a new single-photon emission tomography ligand for 5-HT2A receptors: influence of age and gender in healthy subjects.	aging	1998-12-??	5-HT2A receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and in the therapeutic effect of the so-called atypical antipsychotics. Recently, a new radioiodinated ligand with high affinity and selectivity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, 123iodinated 4-amino-N-1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl] 5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (123I-5-I-R91150), has been developed and has been shown to be suitable for single-photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging. In this study the influence of age and gender on the ligand binding was investigated in normal volunteers. One hundred and fifty MBq of 123I-5-I-R91150 was administered to 26 normal volunteers (13 females and 13 males) with an age range of 23-60 years. SPET imaging was performed with a triple-headed gamma camera. For semi-quantitative analysis, ratios of ligand binding in different regions of interest to the binding in the cerebellum were calculated. Mean ratios of 1.7 were obtained. No gender difference was d…
529838	Loss of hybridizable ribosomal DNA from human post-mitotic tissues during aging: II. Age-dependent loss in human cerebral cortex--hippocampal and somatosensory cortex comparison.	lifespan	1979-12-??	DNA was isolated from the hippocampal and from the somatosensory cortex of 13 humans (at autopsy). In both the cortex and hippocampus, the loss of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), as measured through hybridization in the liquid phase, approximates about 0.9% per year. The r value for somatosensory cortex was about -0.7 and that for the hippocampus was about -0.91. The correlation coefficient between the sets of two samples derived from the same individual (two different areas) in +0.945. These results are consistent with those reported concurrently for human myocardium and with earlier studies conducted with beagle dogs, in which only post-mitotic tissues (brain, heart and skeletal muscle) showed measurable decrements in these key genes. To the degree that the synthesis of new proteins is essential for sustained mental activity, these results are consistent with the observations that Nissl substance is more slowly replenished, following exhaustive work by motor cortical cells, and the fact that m…
21646369	Persistence of sleep-associated decrease in GnRH pulse frequency in the absence of gonadal steroids.	aging	2011-08-??	CONTEXT: There is dramatic slowing of GnRH pulse frequency during sleep in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, but it is unknown whether this represents a primary effect of sleep or is dependent upon the sex steroid environment.    OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine 1) whether sleep affects GnRH pulse frequency in postmenopausal women (PMW) in whom gonadal hormones are low and 2) whether this relationship changes with aging.    DESIGN AND SETTING: Studies were performed in the Clinical Research Center of an academic medical center.    SUBJECTS: Subjects included healthy PMW, 45-55 (n = 8) and 70-80 (n = 6) years old.    INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were studied during one night of polysomnographic-recorded sleep and one night of monitored wake during which blood was sampled every 5 min for 8 h.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pulsatile secretion of free α-subunit (FAS), a marker of GnRH secretion, was assessed.    RESULTS: There were no differences in sleep macroarchitectur…
3976251	Study of blood lipid content and occurrence of hyperlipoproteinemias in hypertensive patients of various age.	aging	????-??-??	The level of serum lipids and HLP occurrence were investigated in apparently healthy subjects and in patients with arterial hypertension (essential and systolic forms) aged 20-30, 60-74 and 75-89 years. The increase of total cholesterol and atherogeneity coefficient, HLP occurrence and decrease of alpha-cholesterol content were noted in the control group during aging. The essential hypertension is accompanied by the increased HLP occurrence mainly in 20-30 and 60-74 year-old patients, as compared with the corresponding control groups. The content of serum lipids and HLP occurrence were found to be higher in 75-89-year-old patients within systolic hypertension group.
24502904	Integration of visual and haptic informations in the perception of the vertical in young and old healthy adults and right brain-damaged patients.	aging	2014-01-??	OBJECTIVE: Multimodal perception raises the issue of sensory integration. The aim of this study is to assess whether the visuo-haptic subjective vertical could be predicted from the visual and haptic unimodal performances, according to a Bayesian model, which optimizes the reliability of the multimodal estimate. The limits of the model were assessed by evaluating the impact of aging, cerebral damage and spatial deficits.    METHOD: Young and older healthy participants, as well as patients with a right hemisphere lesion, suffering from spatial neglect or not, had to align a rod with the gravitational vertical in the visual, haptic and visuo-haptic modalities.    RESULTS: Visuo-haptic subjective vertical was correctly predicted by the model in healthy participants, as well as in patients in spite of different performances. An anticlockwise deviation of the subjective vertical was observed in the neglect group whatever the experimental conditions. By contrast, no deviation was observed in…
9726008	AT-rich sequences flanking the 5'-end breakpoint of the 4977-bp deletion of human mitochondrial DNA are located between two bent-inducing DNA sequences that assume distorted structure in organello.	aging	1998-07-17	The 4977-bp deletion is the most common deletion among more than 90 large-scale deletions of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that are associated with aging and mitochondrial myopathies. The reason why the frequency of occurrence of this common deletion is so high in aged and myopathic human tissues is not clear. Since several studies proved that unusual DNA structures play very important roles in a number of recombination events, we hypothesized that some kind of unusual DNA structure may flank the breakpoints of the 4977-bp mtDNA deletion. We used two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis to assess the mobility abnormalities of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments encompassing the sequences of nucleotide position (np) 7901 to 9058 of human mtDNA. The results showed that the sequences of np 7901-8732 and np 8251-9058 exhibited retarded and increased mobilities, respectively, and that the sequence of np 8285-8676 showed normal mobility in the 2-D gel. This indicates that the 5'-end breakpoin…
21341396	Correlation between sonographic and endocrine markers of ovarian aging as predictors for late menopausal transition.	aging	2011-02-??	OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that ovarian volume and antral follicle counts (AFCs) may be useful indicators of menopause status. In this study, we examined several sonographic and endocrine markers of ovarian aging for their ability to discriminate between premenopausal and late menopausal transition (LMT) status.    METHODS: A total of 40 women aged 40 to 55 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Premenopausal women (n = 21) were required to have regular menstrual cycles (24 to 35 days), and women in LMT (n = 19) must have experienced 3 to 11 months of amenorrhea. Participants underwent a transvaginal ultrasound to determine ovarian volume and AFCs; provided blood for the measurement of antimüllerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, and estradiol; and completed a questionnaire. The correlation between ovarian aging markers and AFCs was investigated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was calculat…
25205853	Cohort Profile: The Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan.	aging	2016-02-??	The Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Taiwanese middle-aged and older adults. It adds the collection of biomarkers and performance assessments to the Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA), a nationally representative study of adults aged 60 and over, including the institutionalized population. The TLSA began in 1989, with follow-ups approximately every 3 years; younger refresher cohorts were added in 1996 and 2003. The first wave of SEBAS, based on a sub-sample of respondents from the 1999 TLSA, was conducted in 2000. A total of 1023 respondents completed both a face-to-face home interview and, several weeks later, a hospital-based physical examination. In addition to a 12-h (7 pm-7 am) urine specimen collected the night before and a fasting blood specimen collected during the examination, trained staff measured blood pressure, height, weight and waist and hip circumferences. A second wave of SEBAS was con…
21029471	Executive functions and selective attention are favored in middle-aged healthy women carriers of the Val/Val genotype of the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene: a behavioral genetic study.	aging	2010-10-29	BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits such as poor memory, the inability to concentrate, deficits in abstract reasoning, attention and set-shifting flexibility have been reported in middle-aged women. It has been suggested that cognitive decline may be due to several factors which include hormonal changes, individual differences, normal processes of aging and age-related changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a common functional polymorphism, has been related to executive performance in young healthy volunteers, old subjects and schizophrenia patients. The effect of this polymorphism on cognitive function in middle-aged healthy women is not well known. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether measures of executive function, sustained attention, selective attention and verbal fluency would be different depending on the COMT genotype and task demand.    METHOD: We genotyped 74 middle-aged healthy women (48 to 65 years old) for the COMT Val…
328557	Prolactin cells of the human pituitary gland in old age.	aging	1977-09-??	Pituitary glands obtained at autopsy from 20 male and 20 female subjects, over 80 years of age, have been investigated with various staining procedures, including the immunoperoxidase technique for the cytological localization of prolactin. Prolactin cells were numerous and well developed in the anterior lobes. The incidence, distribution, granulation and immunoreactivity of prolactin cells showed no apparent difference between old male and female subjects dying of acute or chronic illnesses. It can be concluded that prolactin cells do not regress in old age. The morphologic findings are consistent with the assumption that the pituitary gland is capable of secreting prolactin in aging subjects.
3127098	Heterogeneity of immune responsiveness in healthy elderly subjects.	aging	1988-05-??	We studied a group of healthy elderly subjects (satisfying the SENIEUR Protocol admission criteria), chosen as a model of age-associated immune deficiency on the basis of their reduced skin reactivity to recall antigens. Results show that aged subjects, taken as a whole, display impaired T-cell functions: reduced blastogenetic responses to mitogens, IL-2 production, responsiveness to exogenous IL-2, and percentage of Tac positive blasts. However, the age-associated immune defect shows a wide range of impairment, even in a relatively homogeneous group of anergic/hypoergic subjects. In fact, a considerable proportion of our elderly subjects displays responses comparable with those of adult controls. These observations suggest that (a) immune deficiency is not a characteristic of aging per se; (b) cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity is not a criterion sensitive enough to identify people with age-associated immune deficit; and (c) more than one test is required to evaluate T-cell impairment…
24457646	Does brain ability to synchronize with 40 Hz auditory stimulation change with age?	aging	2013-??-??	Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are widely applied to test brain ability to follow external stimulation and this appeared to be a promising method in neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, there is no established conclusion on the way aging affects phase-locking measures of ASSRs in healthy subjects. We aimed to identify the effects of aging on phaselocking measures of 40 Hz ASSR. The effect of aging was tested in a sample of 46 healthy male subjects (20-58 years old) during eyes open condition. Stimuli were 500 ms trains, consisting of 20 identical clicks (1.5 ms burst of white noise) delivered binaurally. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. As shown by curve-fitting analyses, phase-locking index and evoked amplitudes were diminishing with age in the linear manner. This was also proven by ANOVA testing when sample was di…
29470423	3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-Heptamethoxyflavone, a Citrus Flavonoid, Inhibits Collagenase Activity and Induces Type I Procollagen Synthesis in HDFn Cells.	aging	2018-02-22	fruits contain various types of flavonoids with powerful anti-aging and photoprotective effects on the skin, and have thus been attracting attention as potential, efficacious skincare agents. Here, we aimed to investigate the chemical composition of  and its protective effects on photoaging. We isolated and identified a bioactive compound, 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), from  peels using ethanol extraction and hexane fractionation. HMF inhibited collagenase activity and increased type I procollagen content in UV-induced human dermal fibroblast neonatal (HDFn) cells. HMF also suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1 (MMP-1) and induced the expression of type I procollagen protein in UV-induced HDFn cells. Additionally, HMF inhibited ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascade signaling components-ERK, JNK, and c-Jun-which are involved in the induction of MMP-1 expression. Furthermore, HMF affected the TG…
19428166	Chronic glucocorticoid hypersecretion in Cushing's syndrome exacerbates cognitive aging.	lifespan, aging	2009-10-??	Cumulative exposure to glucocorticoid hormones (GC) over the lifespan has been associated with cognitive impairment and may contribute to physical and cognitive degeneration in aging. The objective of the present study was to examine whether the pattern of cognitive deficits in patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS), a disorder characterized by chronic exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GC), is similar to that observed in older individuals. Ten subjects with CS were compared to sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls and older subjects (age of CS subjects+15 yr). All participants were administered tests to assess attention, visuospatial processing, learning and memory, reasoning, concept formation and verbal fluency. MANCOVAs with depression scores as covariate and polynomial contrasts revealed that the age-matched control group performed better than the CS and older subject groups in visual target detection, trail making test, stroop task, digit symbol substitut…
22584047	Increased type II collagen cleavage by cathepsin K and collagenase activities with aging and osteoarthritis in human articular cartilage.	aging	2012-05-14	INTRODUCTION: The intra-helical cleavage of type II collagen by proteases, including collagenases and cathepsin K, is increased with aging and osteoarthritis (OA) in cartilage as determined by immunochemical assays. The distinct sites of collagen cleavage generated by collagenases and cathepsin K in healthy and OA human femoral condylar cartilages were identified and compared.    METHODS: Fixed frozen cartilage sections were examined immunohistochemically, using antibodies that react with the collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitopes, C2C and C1,2C, and the primary cleavage neoepitope (C2K) generated in type II collagen by the action of cathepsin K and possibly by other proteases, but not by any collagenases studied to date.    RESULTS: In most cases, the staining patterns for collagen cleavage were similar for all three epitopes: weak to moderate mainly pericellular staining in non-OA cartilage from younger individuals and stronger, more widespread staining in aging and OA cartilages…
6333539	Effects of aging on the in vitro response of human lymphocytes to interleukin-2.	aging	1984-08-??	Effects of aging on the in vitro responses of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to interleukin-2 (IL-2, T-cell growth factor) were studied. Aged PBL showed a significantly lower response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) than young PBL. On the other hand, proliferative responses to exogenous IL-2 showed by aged PBL were found to be in same extent as those of young PBL. In addition, cultured lymphoid cells propagated in IL-2 (CLC-IL-2) derived from both young and aged PBL showed a strong cytotoxic reactivity against the natural killer (NK) sensitive target K562.
12917753	Levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), IGF II, IGF binding proteins, type 1 IGF receptor and growth hormone binding protein in community-dwelling elderly subjects with no malnutrition and no inflammation.	aging	2003-??-??	Plasma samples from community-dwelling subjects aged 65 to 92 presenting no malnutrition and no inflammation (as assessed by albumin, transthyretin, CRP, and orosomucoid levels and BMI) were compared to those of healthy controls aged 20 to 65 to determine the effect of aging on the IGF system. Concentrations of IGF I, IGF II and IGFBP3 significantly decreased, and those of GHBP slightly increased with age from 20 to 92 years (n=327 r=-0.64 p<0.0001; n=45 r=-0.44 p<0.003; n=91 r=-0.23 p<0.03 and n=61 r=0.26; p<0.05 respectively). Western immunoblotting showed that the proteolysis of IGFBP3 was not significantly different in elderly and younger subjects. The affinity of the IGF type 1 receptor for IGF I was moderately lower (Ki=0.56 0.2 vs 0.33 0.1, nM respectively; p<0.005) and the number of binding sites was moderately higher (10.4 1.5 vs 8.1 1.9 binding sites/cell, respectively; p<0.03) in the elderly than in the younger adults. Our results suggest that the age-related decline in plas…
9367870	The conformation formed by the domain after alanine-155 induces inversion of aspartic acid-151 in alpha A-crystallin from aged human lenses.	aging	1997-10-29	A new cleavage site, which is a post-translational modification, was found between residues His-154 and Ala-155 in alpha A-crystallin from the aged human lens. After trypsin digestion of alpha A-crystallin two peptides that include Asp-151 were obtained and have remarkable differences. That is, the stereo-configuration of the Asp-151 in the normal length peptide was predominately inverted to the D-isomer of beta-aspartyl form (D/L of 5.7). However, the stereoconfiguration of the Asp-151 in the cleavage peptide, that lacks the sequence following Ala-155 to the C-terminus, remained predominately in the L-isomer form as indicated by a D/L value of 0.3. The results suggest that the secondary structure in the region of Ala-155 to the C-terminus may constitute a field that causes the inversion of the Asp-151 to the D-isomer form. Since this kind of cleavage was not found in alpha A-crystallin from young lens, the cleavage between His-154 and Ala-155 is probably the result of aging.
1181358	Human growth hormone and cortisol response to insulin stimulation in aging.	aging	1975-09-??	The influence of age on plasma growth hormone (HGH) and cortisol response to i.v. insulin (0.1 U/kg of body weight) was evaluated in 32 healthy subjects whose ages ranged between 20 and 84 years. A significant reduction in HGH response to insulin was observed with aging. In the young (20-34 years), middel-aged (35-49 years), and elderly (53-84 years) groups, average HGH peaks were 46.51 +/- 7.37, 29.95 +/- 5.35, and 14.31 +/- 2.39 ng/ml while average HGH areas were 2.911 +/- 0.484, 1.654 +/- 0.316, and 0.699 +/- 0.149 mug-min, respectively. Since insulin's hypoglycemic effect became less rapid with aging, this could, in part, explain the progressive decline in the HGH response to insulin. This phenomen may also be attributed to histological changes occurring in the pituitary with aging. Moreover, cortisol response was similar to all three age groups. These findings suggest that, while HGH response to insulin is correlated with age, adrenal response does not show any important modificat…
6380541	Calcium and osteoporosis.	aging	1984-??-??	It has become increasingly apparent that the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is complex, poorly understood, and ill-defined. Calcium deficiency and/or calcium malabsorption and the homeostatic response to this biological insult may ultimately prove to be one of the pivotal factors in conditioning or modulating the skeletal response to senescence. Until we know more about the prevention and potential reversibility of age-related changes in bone cell function, hormonal secretion and metabolism, and dietary patterns that prove deleterious to skeletal health, clinicians will be confronted with an ever-increasing population of aging, fracture-prone, osteoporotic patients. Because calcium supplements improve the calcium balance of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and because improvements in calcium balance can be correlated with increased skeletal mass, it appears desirable to focus our efforts on diets and/or calcium supplements that guarantee an adequate supply of this essential minera…
28403622	Amyloid Positivity Using [18F]Flutemetamol-PET and Cognitive Deficits in Nondemented Community-Dwelling Older Adults.	aging	2017-09-??	Little research exists examining the relationship between beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density via [18F]flutemetamol binding and cognition; consequently, the purpose of the current study was to compare cognitive performances among individuals having either increased amyloid deposition (Flute+) or minimal amyloid deposition (Flute-). Twenty-seven nondemented community-dwelling adults over the age of 65 underwent [18F]flutemetamol amyloid-positron emission tomography imaging, along with cognitive testing using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and select behavioral measures. Analysis of variance was used to identify the differences among the cognitive and behavioral measures between Flute+/Flute- groups. Flute+ participants performed significantly worse than Flute- participants on RBANS indexes of immediate memory, language, delayed memory, and total scale score, but no significant group differences in the endorsed level of depression or subje…
23992484	Subjective cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy older adults: association with personality traits.	aging	2014-07-??	AIM: In normal aging, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) might reflect personality traits or affective states rather than objective cognitive decline. However, little is known on the correlates of SCD in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The present study investigates SCD in MCI patients and healthy older adults, and explores the association of SCD with personality traits, affective states, behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS), and episodic memory in patients with MCI as compared with healthy older adults.    METHODS: A total of 55 patients with MCI and 84 healthy older adults were recruited. Standard instruments were used to evaluate SCD, episodic memory, BPS and affective states. Premorbid and current personality traits were assessed by proxies using the NEO Personality Inventory Revised.    RESULTS: Patients with MCI generally reported SCD more often than healthy older adults. SCD was positively associated with depressive symptoms in both groups. With regard to personality, no…
11490148	Natural killer activity and thyroid hormone levels in young and elderly persons.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: On the basis that (1) multiple interactions exist between the hormonal and immune systems, and (2) aging is accompanied by changes in thyroid hormone metabolism and responsiveness, we postulate that thyroid hormones may be involved in the observed decrease in natural killer (NK) activity in a population of apparently healthy elderly subjects. The purpose of the study is to compare NK cytotoxic activity and serum concentrations of TSH and thyroid hormones in healthy old and young people, and to assess in vitro the effects of triiodothyronine (T(3)) on NK activity.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen of the 47 healthy old people (mean age 64 +/- 5.2) were classified as optimally healthy, and the remainder as 'almost healthy' (according to the criteria of the Senieur protocol) [Ligthart et al., Mech Ageing Dev 1984;28:47-55]; the mean age of the healthy young people was 23.3 +/- 2.3 years. NK cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed using (51)Cr rele…
6908897	The effect of aging on urinary kallikrein excretion in normotensive subjects and in patients with essential hypertension.	aging	1981-05-??	The effect of aging on urinary kallikrein excretion (UkalV) was investigated in 54 normal subjects, 11-88 yr old, and 37 patients with essential hypertension, 17-82 yr old. Urinary sodium, potassium, and aldosterone excretion (U(Ald)V) were also measured in these subjects. Urinary sodium and potassium excretion in both normal subjects and hypertensive patients did not significantly change with aging. In normal subjects, U(kal)V (r = 0.45; P less than 0.001) and U(Ald)V (r = 0.58; P less than 0.01) significantly decreased with increasing age. U(kal)V was positively correlated with U(Ald)V (r = 0.44; P less than 0.001). In contrast, the hypertensive patients had a significant decrease with age in U(Ald)V (r = -0.36; P less than 0.05), but no significant age-related change in U(kal)V. No significant correlation between U(kal)V and U(Ald)V was observed in the hypertensive patients. In individuals less than 60 yr old, there was no significant difference in U(kal)V values between normal subj…
12414100	Effects of sex, age, and aggressive traits in man on brain serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding potential measured by PET using [C-11]WAY-100635.	aging	2002-11-08	Serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptors have been implicated in a variety of conditions including, depression, suicidal behavior, and aggression. Post-mortem brain studies and in vivo imaging studies report a variety of age and sex effects on brain 5-HT(1A) binding. Behavioral data from 5-HT(1A) specific pharmacological challenges suggest a role for 5-HT(1A) receptors in aggression. The goal of the present study was to determine age, sex, and severity of life-time aggression effects on 5-HT(1A) binding potential (BP) in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and the high affinity 5-HT(1A) antagonist, [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in 12 healthy females (ages 41.0+/-15.7 years) and 13 healthy males (ages 39.6+/-15.5 years). Regions of interest included the dorsal raphe, anterior cingulate cortex, cingulate body, hippocampus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and orbital PFC. No significant correlation between age and BP was detected in any brain region. MANOVA of the first three princip…
16261458	Urinary excretion of type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase analysis to determine the correlation of age and back-pain related changes in elderly women.	aging	2005-??-??	We evaluated bone turnover using biochemical markers in 273 women over 60 years of age with suspected osteoporosis. Their age range was 60-96 years, with an average of 72.7 years. Patients with disorders that might affect bone metabolism were excluded. Those complaining of back pain within 6 months before or after examination were assigned to the back-pain group. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was measured as a bone formation marker, and the urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) was measured as a bone resorption marker. Both BAP and NTX levels increased in individuals over 60 years of age; moreover, these markers were significantly higher in subjects aged over 80 years. Among elderly patients, both BAP and NTX levels were significantly higher in those with back pain than in those without, and in a similar way were observed to increase in parallel with age from the 60-year point. We found that both NTX and BAP increased with aging, and that the increase…
7529388	Detection and quantitation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs in human hippocampus using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique and their correlation with binding site densities and age.	aging	1994-08-29	The presence and abundance of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs in post mortem human hippocampus was investigated using a novel quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique using cyclophilin mRNA as an internal standard. 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs were each co-amplified with varying dilutions of cyclophilin primers, and their abundance expressed as a ratio of cyclophilin mRNA. Using this technique in combination with quantitative autoradiography we have investigated the effect of aging on hippocampal 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mRNA abundance and binding site densities. There was a significant negative correlation between hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor binding site densities and age and a similar trend for 5-HT1A receptor mRNA abundance. Neither 5-HT2A receptor binding site densities nor mRNA abundance were affected by age. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding site densities in individual subjects correlated significantly with abundance of their e…
21276673	Nutrition in centenarians.	longevity	2011-03-??	The oldest old are among the fastest growing segment of the population and it is important to understand not only the influence of modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition on the achievement of exceptional longevity but also the role, if any, of these factors on maintaining optimal cognitive, mental and physical health into advanced age. This review summarizes studies of dietary intake and patterns of long-lived peoples and presents current knowledge of nutritional status of centenarians as determined with nutritionally relevant biomarkers, providing information on comparative levels of the various biomarkers between centenarians and older adult controls and on the prevalence and predictors of nutritional deficiencies in centenarians. The studies indicate that BMI and nutritional status as indicated by circulating levels of antioxidant vitamins, vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine and 25(OH) vitamin D of centenarians are quite heterogeneous and influenced by region of resi…
19861222	The Elder's Right to Sight Collaborative: a new model of eye care delivery for the elderly.	aging	2009-11-??	Vision and visual impairment have a significant impact on older adults' daily function and safety within their homes and communities. Yet many do not seek out the necessary care to address their visual health. Many older adults want to age in places that require a supportive environment to compensate for changes in abilities and to promote healthy aging and quality of life. The Elder's Right to Sight Collaborative (ERTS) was established to gain insight into the role of the environment in maintaining the functional independence and safety of older adults with visual impairment and to understand the barriers to obtaining the necessary eye care services. The ERTS provides education, screening, environmental assessments, and simple tools to complete daily activities. The screening results indicate significant need for eye care services to this population. However, service delivery needs to be flexible to meet the needs of this population. A team approach to address education, eye care serv…
9515055	The aggregation in human lens proteins blocks the scavenging of UVA-generated singlet oxygen by ascorbic acid and glutathione.	aging	1998-03-15	One hour of UVA irradiation of air-saturated solutions of 2 mg/mL solubilized lens protein aggregates from aged human lens is able to produce on accumulated concentration of more than 2mM 1O2, along with oxidation of 120 nmol/mL of both Trp and His amino acid residues. Increasing concentrations of either sodium azide or ascorbic acid (up to 10 mM) during the irradiation decreased th His destruction by no more than 50-60% with the intact aggregates, but completely prevented the His loss with proteolyzed aggregates. Glutathione (up to 10 mM) was able to protect less than 10% of the aggregate His residues from oxidative damage, whereas His loss was almost completely prevented in the proteolyzed aggregates. Similar data were obtained for teh UVA photolysis of the Trp residues. This finding led us to study the role a protein conformation of these aggregates plays in the diminishing of antioxidant ability to prevent UVA-mediated photolysis of 1O2-sensitive amino acid residues. We found that …
440299	Inhibitors of oxidative degradation of protein: gerontological implications.	aging	1979-02-15	Compounds were studied that inhibit the oxidative degradation of human serum albumin by peroxidase and the enzyme model, iron hydroxide. Differences between the two oxidants gave clues for the mechanism of inhibition. The inhibitors studied were inorganic anions, phosphate, sulfate, carbonate and molybdate; organic anions, decanoate and glycocholate; and the nonionic species, glycogen. Such inhibitors might be considered as adjuvants in senescence: by decreasing the rate of enzymic oxidation of essential body proteins, they would, in the course of aging, reduce some of the physiological changes occurring as a result of accumulation of degraded protein.
6453157	Deficiency of autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions and serum thymic factor level in Down's syndrome.	aging	1981-06-??	The immune competence of the T lymphocyte system was studied in 28 noninstitutionalized subjects with Down's syndrome (DS) and were compared with sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The ability of enriched T lymphocytes to respond to 3 different T cell stimulants revealed a selective impairment of T lymphocyte subset(s). Subjects with DS showed normal responsiveness in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions, but their response to phytohemagglutinin and in autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions was severely impaired. Non-T cells from DS subjects stimulated equally well both normal and DS allogeneic T lymphocytes. The blood concentration of serum thymic factor in the majority of DS subjects was much lower than that found in age-matched healthy controls. These data support the hypothesis that a deficiency of the T-dependent regulatory system is an intrinsic feature of DS and confirm the precocious aging of the immune system in these subjects.
11874413	Inhibin B in boys from birth to adulthood: relationship with age, pubertal stage, FSH and testosterone.	aging	2002-02-??	OBJECTIVE: Inhibin B in males is produced principally by Sertoli cells under the influence of FSH and is thought to have a role in feedback regulation of FSH. The aims of our study were to investigate how inhibin B changes from birth to late adolescence in boys, to derive reference data and to explore its relation with pubertal stage, FSH and testosterone.    DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Blood samples were collected from (i) 366 boys aged 0--18 years to obtain age-related reference data; (ii) 195 boys who had full pubertal staging; and (iii) a cohort of 15 boys studied longitudinally as they approached and entered early puberty.    MEASUREMENTS: Dimeric inhibin B was measured by double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), FSH by immunoradiometric assay (IRA) and testosterone by an extraction radioimmunoassay.    RESULTS: Inhibin B was high in infant boys, decreased gradually to a nadir at 6--10 years of age, then increased rapidly in early adolescence to reach a new plateau at 1…
16804002	Heat-shock protein 70 genes and human longevity: a view from Denmark.	longevity	2006-05-??	We have studied the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the three HSP70 (heat-shock protein) genes on 6p21 with human longevity. The availability of biological samples from various population cohorts in Denmark has given us the opportunity to try novel methods of gene association with human longevity. A significant association of one haplotype with male longevity was observed. Furthermore, a significant difference in the survival of the carriers of the different genotypes in females was observed. We also found an age-dependant decline in the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to respond to heat stress in terms of Hsp70 induction.
3700584	Plasma catecholamines, dietary carbohydrate, and glucose intolerance: a comparison between young and old men.	aging	1986-06-??	Catecholamines play an important role in glucose homeostasis. This study was designed to determine whether circulating catecholamine changes in the elderly play a role in the glucose intolerance of aging and whether these changes are related to dietary carbohydrate intake. Plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and glucose were measured before and for 2 h after the administration of 100 g oral glucose in both 18 young (age, 18-39 yr) and 20 old (age, 60-82 yr) normal men during ad libitum home diet and after 3-day weight-maintaining, high or low carbohydrate formula diets in the Clinical Research Center. The elderly men had higher plasma norepinephrine levels before and after oral glucose than the young men even when eating matched formula diets. Plasma epinephrine levels were similar and decreased significantly after oral glucose in both groups. There was no relationship between catecholamine levels and degree of glucose tolerance. A high carbohydrate diet improved glu…
12007830	G protein-coupled receptor kinases, beta-arrestin-2 and associated regulatory proteins in the human brain: postmortem changes, effect of age and subcellular distribution.	aging	2002-05-30	G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and beta-arrestin-2 play a crucial role in the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors in brain. In this study, GRK2, GRK6, beta-arrestin-2 and associated regulatory proteins (Gbeta proteins and protein phosphatase (PP)-2A) were quantitated in human brains (immunodensity with specific antibodies) to assess for postmortem changes (pattern of protein degradation) and to investigate the effect of aging on these regulatory proteins as well as their subcellular distribution (cytosol and membrane fractions). In brain (prefrontal cortex, total homogenate) of healthy subjects (n=14) the immunodensities of GRK2 (r=-0.76), GRK6 (r=-0.64), beta-arrestin-2 (r=-0.57), Gbeta proteins (r=-0.59) and neurofilament (NF)-L (r=-0.64), but not PP-2A, declined markedly with the length of postmortem delay (PMD, 3-81 h). With these linear decay models, the average decreases per 12 h of PMD (from 12 to 72 h) were 7-11% for the various proteins. The immunodensities of …
24035714	Multiple myeloma international staging system: "staging" or simply "aging" system?	aging	2013-12-??	Because of the wide variation in multiple myeloma (MM) survival, numerous studies have focused over the past 40 years on the biological and cytogenetic prognostic values in MM patients. Since 2005, the MM International Staging System (ISS) has recognized the combination of beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) with serum albumin (SA) concentrations as the most simple and potent combination to determine the prognosis in MM patients. Curiously, the reasons for the efficiency of the combination of β2M with SA remain not clear-cut. In 2007, Fonseca and San Miguel (Prognostic factors and staging in multiple myeloma. Hematol Oncol Clin North Am 2007; 21:1115-40) underlined that cytogenetic assessment might also be useful for evaluating MM prognosis. Furthermore, new perspectives recently appeared with the genomic approach. Here, we (1) question the specific rationale for β2M and SA as prognostic markers in MM, (2) emphasize the well-documented prognostic implications of β2M and SA as potent biomarkers …
95628	Subnormal tissue 3 alpha-androstanediol and androsterone in prostatic hyperplasia.	aging	1978-10-??	We investigated the role of 3 alpha-androstanediol (3 alpha-diol) in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the apparent equilibrium of enzymes which metabolize it in normal and hyperplastic prostatic tissue of humans. We determined the endogenous concentrations of 3 alpha-diol, androsterone, its 3 alpha-17-keto metabolite or precursor, and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), its 3-keto,17 beta-hydroxy product of precursor, by RIA after extraction and paper chromatography of the androgens from normal and hyperplastic prostate glands. The mean concentrations of 3 alpha-diol and androsterone were about one-third of normal in BPH. The mean ratio of the concentration of DHT to 3 alpha-diol was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than normal in BPH, whereas no statistical difference was observed for the mean ratio of the tissue levels of 3 alpha-diol to androsterone in the two groups. Our data do not support the postulate that 3 alpha-diol is causally related to the d…
6742687	Ocular fluorophotometry using high S-N ratio fluorophotometer.	aging	1984-05-??	fluorophotometer was remolded to improve S-N (Sensitivity-Noise) ratio by means of photomultiplier cooling system, and ocular fluorophotometry was performed in 13 subjects aged from 20 to 40 (mean 32.5) years old and 13 subjects aged from 55 to 62 (mean 59.2) years old to assess aging effect on the blood-ocular barrier. The results revealed that the fluorescence value at the midvitreous, lenticular autofluorescence, and the anterior chamber of older group is higher than that of the younger group (p less than 0.05). The higher value of midvitreous may be derived from increase of diffusion rate due to vitreous liqueation rather than the blood-retinal barrier abnormalities.
7119111	Changes in bone mineral density of the proximal femur and spine with aging. Differences between the postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis syndromes.	aging	1982-10-??	We measured bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal femur, lumbar spine, or both by dual photon absorptiometry in 205 normal volunteers (123 women and 82 men; age range 20 to 92 yr) and in 31 patients with hip fractures (26 women and 5 men; mean age, 78 yr). For normal women, the regression of BMD on age was negative and linear at each site; overall decrease during life was 58% in the femoral neck, 53% in the intertrochanteric region of the femur, and 42% in the lumbar spine. For normal men, the age regression was linear also; the rate of decrease in BMD was two-thirds of that in women for femoral neck and intertrochanteric femur but was only one-fourth of that in women for lumbar spine. This difference may explain why the female/male ratio is 2:1 for hip fractures but 8:1 for vertebral fractures. The standard deviation (Z-score) from the sex-specific age-adjusted normal mean in 26 women with hip fracture averaged -0.31 (P < 0.05) for the femoral neck, -0.53 (P < 0.01) for the inter…
19086911	Weight increase is associated with skeletal muscle immunostaining for advanced glycation end products, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and oxidation injury.	aging	2008-12-??	BACKGROUND: Tissue accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is associated with ageing, both in diabetics and nondiabetic subjects.    AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess immunostaining for AGEs, specifically carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), in muscle tissue of healthy male subjects differing in age and weight stability.    METHODOLOGY: Muscle tissue was obtained during hernia surgery in middle-aged men reporting weight maintenance (WM, n = 10) or weight gain (WG, n = 7), and also in 4 elderly men. Tissue inmunostaining for CML and RAGE was performed.    RESULTS: Intensity of CML and RAGE staining were highly correlated (r = 0.84) and also significantly associated with weight change and age. Muscle AGEs accretion was statistically associated with muscle expression of oxidative injury (8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) and inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha).    DISCUSSION: The increase of skeletal muscle AGEs/…
19876863	Buccal micronucleus frequency is associated with age in Down syndrome.	aging	2009-10-13	Down syndrome has been linked to premature aging and genomic instability. We examined the frequency of micronucleus (MN) and binucleated cells in the oral mucosa of Down syndrome patients and healthy controls matched by age and gender, addressing the effect of age and family income. Down syndrome individuals had an increased number of MN (14.30 +/- 9.35 vs 4.03 +/- 1.71; P<0.001) and binucleated cells (0.97 +/- 1.3 vs 0.33 +/- 0.66; P<0.05) per 2000 cells. Micronucleus frequency of Down syndrome individuals correlated positively with age (r = 0.437; P = 0.009), and the older (> or =21) Down syndrome age group (30.8 +/- 8.4 years old) had about 2-fold more micronuclei (P < or = 0.05) than did the younger group (<21). Average family income did not correlate with MN frequency in controls (r = -0.948; P = 0.183), but a borderline negative correlation was seen in DS subjects (r = -0.9484; P = 0.0516). Individuals whose average income was ten times minimum wages had about 2-fold less MN than…
7743391	The role of adenosine in promoting cardiac beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in aging humans.	aging	1995-05-??	The mechanism by which aging decreases the cardiac chronotropic response in human subjects is unknown. We investigated the role of endogenous adenosine in attenuating the chronotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation due to aging by employing the adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline. Sixteen healthy elderly (67.1 +/- 1.3 yrs) and sixteen healthy young (26.1 +/- 0.6 yrs) subjects were studied. The bolus dose of isoproterenol necessary to increase the heart rate 25 beats per minute (I25) was determined by calculating the log dose response curve before and after a 30-min infusion of theophylline (6.5 mg/kg) in each subject. In addition, the effect of theophylline on the orthostatic increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined. The I25 for the elderly and young groups were 34.55 +/- 6.98 and 10.85 +/- 1.93 ng/kg, respectively (p < .01). After theophylline administration, the difference in I25 in the two groups was no longer present (13.32 +/- 2.72 vs 7.46 +/- 1.26…
6294172	Effect of age on red cell membrane sodium -potassium dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+ ATPase) activity in healthy men.	aging	1983-01-??	Decreased cellular thermogenesis may represent a normal aspect of the aging process. Whereas Na+-K+ ATPase appears to be involved directly in body metabolism, enzyme activity on the erythrocyte membrane Na+-K+ ATPase was significantly lower in aged men. In a separate series of experiments, each with representation from the two age groups, red cell membrane Na+-K+ ATPase was also found to be decreased significantly in the aged men. Although mean values were statistically different, one of the elderly men had enzyme activity above that of the mean of the younger men. None of the younger men had enzyme activity below the mean of the older group. Red cell membrane Na+-,+ ATPase activity may be an indicator of physiological aging.
8727189	The human lumbar endplate. Evidence of changes in biosynthesis and denaturation of the extracellular matrix with growth, maturation, aging, and degeneration.	aging	1996-05-15	STUDY DESIGN: The authors measured concentrations of specific molecules reflecting matrix synthesis and degradation in 121 human endplates and correlated them with aging and grade of degeneration.    OBJECTIVES: Abnormal endplate development has been implicated in many spinal abnormalities, yet little is known about endplate matrix component turnover.    SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Techniques are available to perform an in situ investigation of matrix component turnover with aging and degeneration.    METHODS: Newly synthesized aggrecan and Type I and Type II procollagens were measured with recently developed immunoassays. Percentage of denatured Type II collagen was assessed with a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assay.    RESULTS: Synthesis in endplates, measured by content of an aggrecan marker (846) and content of Types I and II procollagen markers (CPI and CPII), is highest in the neonatal and 2- to 5-year age groups and steadily diminishes with increasing age. However,…
12520516	Role of the vitamin D-endocrine system in the pathophysiology of postmenopausal osteoporosis.	aging	2003-02-01	Impaired calcium absorption and impaired adaptation to a low calcium diet are common features of aging in women and these processes are even more severely impaired in patients with osteoporotic fractures. The calcium absorption defects are associated with several abnormalities of the vitamin D-endocrine system including secondary hyperparathyroidism, intestinal resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) action, decreased 1,25(OH)(2)D production due to impaired 25(OH)D 1alpha-hydroxylase activity, and, in some elderly persons, nutritional deficiency of vitamin D. However, in postmenopausal women, most of these abnormalities are normalized by administration of physiologic replacement dosages of estrogen and, thus, appear to be secondary consequences of estrogen deficiency. Nonetheless, a minority of them, especially nutritional vitamin D deficiency and impaired 25(OH)D 1alpha-hydroxylase activity late in life, appear to be primary and are independent of estrogen deficiency.
16688584	In-situ hardening hydroxyapatite-based scaffold for bone repair.	aging	2006-05-??	Musculoskeletal conditions are becoming a major health concern because of an aging population and sports- and traffic-related injuries. While sintered hydroxyapatite implants require machining, calcium phosphate cement (CPC) bone repair material is moldable, self-hardens in situ, and has excellent osteoconductivity. In the present work, new approaches for developing strong and macroporous scaffolds of CPC were tested. Relationships were determined between scaffold porosity and strength, elastic modulus and fracture toughness. A biocompatible and biodegradable polymer (chitosan) and a water-soluble porogen (mannitol) were incorporated into CPC: Chitosan to make the material stronger, fast-setting and anti-washout; and mannitol to create macropores. Flexural strength, elastic modulus, and fracture toughness were measured as functions of mannitol mass fraction in CPC from 0% to 75%. After mannitol dissolution in a physiological solution, macropores were formed in CPC in the shapes of the …
24122288	Satellite cells in human skeletal muscle; from birth to old age.	lifespan, aging	2014-04-??	Changes in satellite cell content play a key role in regulating skeletal muscle growth and atrophy. Yet, there is little information on changes in satellite cell content from birth to old age in humans. The present study defines muscle fiber type-specific satellite cell content in human skeletal muscle tissue over the entire lifespan. Muscle biopsies were collected in 165 subjects, from different muscles of children undergoing surgery (<18 years; n = 13) and from the vastus lateralis muscle of young adult (18–49 years; n = 50), older (50–69 years; n = 53), and senescent subjects (70–86 years; n = 49). In a subgroup of 51 aged subjects (71 ± 6 years), additional biopsies were collected after 12 weeks of supervised resistance-type exercise training. Immunohistochemistry was applied to assess skeletal muscle fiber type-specific composition, size, and satellite cell content. From birth to adulthood, muscle fiber size increased tremendously with no major changes in muscle fiber satellite ce…
10674278	Neurohormonal responses to D-fenfluramine in healthy elderly subjects. A placebo-controlled study.	aging	2000-02-??	Considering age-related changes in serotonin (5HT) function, we examined normative data of prolactin (PRL) and cortisol (CORT) responses to D-fenfluramine (D-FEN) in healthy elderly subjects. Twenty-three healthy male and female volunteers aged 60-86 participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-order, crossover-design challenge test. Two baseline PRL and CORT values and the responses of these hormones to 30 mg of oral D-FEN and placebo over a 4 h period were measured on two separate sessions. PRL and CORT responses were significantly greater following D-FEN than after placebo. Peak PRL responses (maximum change from baseline following D-FEN) were relatively robust compared to peak CORT responses. Peak PRL concentration was positively correlated with plasma D-nor-FEN concentration. Gender and aging had no effect on hormonal responses in the elderly. Although the weight adjusted dose used in this study was higher than the therapeutic dose of D-FEN, PRL responses were modest …
10474123	Two-week pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone infusion unmasks dual (hypothalamic and Leydig cell) defects in the healthy aging male gonadotropic axis.	aging	1999-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that lower serum bioavailable testosterone concentrations, without increased LH release, in healthy older men, reflects hypothalamic GnRH deficiency.    DESIGN: We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design.    METHODS: We treated each of five young (ages 20-34 years) and five older (ages 60-78 years) men with 2 weeks of randomized infusions of saline or pulsatile GnRH (100 ng/kg i.v. every 90 min).    RESULTS: At baseline (saline infusion), older men had more LH pulses (young compared with old, 10 +/- 0.6 compared with 15 +/- 1, P = 0.0026) per 24h, reduced fractional LH pulse amplitude (219 +/- 17% compared with 167 +/- 40%, P = 0.0376), and more disorderly hormone release as judged by approximate entropy (ApEn) (LH, P < or = 0.0001; testosterone, P < or = 0.0047). In response to pulsatile i.v. GnRH infusions, serum 24-h LH concentrations (measured by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)), increased equivalently in young and older men (…
17123740	Postnatal alterations in dopaminergic markers in the human prefrontal cortex.	lifespan	2007-02-09	Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in normal cognition throughout the lifespan and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder. Little is known, however, about the postnatal development of the dopaminergic system in the human prefrontal cortex. In this study, we examined pre- and post-synaptic markers of the dopaminergic system in postmortem tissue specimens from 37 individuals ranging in age from 2 months to 86 years. We measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, using Western immunoblotting. We also examined the gene expression of the three most abundant dopamine receptors (DARs) in the human prefrontal cortex: DAR1, DAR2 and DAR4, by in situ hybridization. We found that tyrosine hydroxylase concentrations and DAR2 mRNA levels were highest in the cortex of neonates. In contrast, the gene expression of DAR1 was highest in adolescen…
14615589	Haplotype-based identification of a microsomal transfer protein marker associated with the human lifespan.	longevity, lifespan	2003-11-25	We previously reported a genomewide linkage study for human longevity using 308 long-lived individuals (LLI) (centenarians or near-centenarians) in 137 sibships and identified statistically significant linkage within chromosome 4 near microsatellite D4S1564. This interval spans 12 million bp and contains approximately 50 putative genes. To identify the specific gene and gene variants impacting lifespan, we performed a haplotype-based fine-mapping study of the interval. The resulting genetic association study identified a haplotype marker within microsomal transfer protein as a modifier of human lifespan. This same variant was tested in a second cohort of LLI from France, and although the association was not replicated, there was evidence for statistical distortion in the form of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. Microsomal transfer protein has been identified as the rate-limiting step in lipoprotein synthesis and may affect longevity by subtly modulating this pathway. This study provides …
23240772	Gastrointestinal peptides, gastrointestinal motility, and anorexia of aging in frail elderly persons.	aging	2013-04-??	BACKGROUND: The mechanisms involved in anorexia in frail elderly people remain unclear. The objective of this study was to establish whether fasting and postprandial levels of gastrointestinal peptides, gastrointestinal motility, and hunger are modified by age and frailty.    METHODS: Three groups of subjects were studied: (a) frail elderly (>70 years) persons, (b) non-frail elderly (>70 years) persons, and (c) healthy adults (aged 25-65 years). After an overnight fast, participants ingested a 400 Kcal liquid meal and appetite, hormonal, and gastrointestinal responses were monitored during early (0-60 min) and late (60-240 min) postprandial periods.    KEY RESULTS: Frail persons showed poor nutritional status, sarcopenia, and almost absence of hunger during fasting and postprandial periods. Older persons presented higher levels of glucose and insulin during fasting, enhanced postprandial CCK release in early postprandial period and postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, but s…
29488689	Morphological changes in hair melanosomes by aging.	aging	2018-??-??	Various changes appear in hair by aging, and graying is the most remarkable one. Changes in melanocytes have been well studied as the cause; however, little is known about the change in melanosomes which have a role of carrying melanin pigments into hair shafts. Using pigmented hairs of Japanese females from their age of 4-75, I isolated melanosomes and observed them. As a result, I found a significant change in the morphology of hair melanosomes with age. They were ellipsoidal on the whole and there was no age dependence in the major axis, while the minor axis significantly increased and its frequency distribution broadened with age. The anticipated volume of the melanosome of the oldest person hairs was about twice larger than that of child hairs. This enlargement of melanosome seems to be a cause of the age-related color change in pigmented hairs from brown to black.
29168295	Lean psoas area does not correlate with clinical outcomes in moderately to severely injured older people.	aging	2018-03-??	OBJECTIVE: Frailty has been associated with worse outcomes in older trauma patients. Specifically, the utility of lean cross-sectional psoas muscle area (LPA) was examined as a potentially simple objective measure of frailty.    METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-four patients over the age of 65 were admitted with trauma between 2011 and 2014. Two hundred and twenty-five of these had adequate computed tomography imaging available for analysis. Cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the inferior endplate of L4 was quantified.    RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis showed no significant correlation between LPA and outcomes of mortality (P = 0.82) or inpatient complications (P = 0.22). Injury Severity Score (ISS) had a strong association with both mortality (odds ratio (OR) 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-30.9) and inpatient complications (OR 9.9; 95% CI 3.5-27.7). Age also had an association with mortality (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03-1.16) and inpatient complications (OR 1.06; 95…
22072686	Brain activity during ankle proprioceptive stimulation predicts balance performance in young and older adults.	lifespan	2011-11-09	Proprioceptive information from the foot/ankle provides important information regarding body sway for balance control, especially in situations where visual information is degraded or absent. Given known increases in catastrophic injury due to falls with older age, understanding the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control is particularly important for older adults. In the present study, we linked neural activity in response to stimulation of key foot proprioceptors (i.e., muscle spindles) with balance ability across the lifespan. Twenty young and 20 older human adults underwent proprioceptive mapping; foot tendon vibration was compared with vibration of a nearby bone in an fMRI environment to determine regions of the brain that were active in response to muscle spindle stimulation. Several body sway metrics were also calculated for the same participants on an eyes-closed balance task. Based on regression analyses, multiple clusters of voxels were identified showin…
27335218	Posture-related changes in brain functional connectivity as assessed by wavelet phase coherence of NIRS signals in elderly subjects.	aging	2016-??-01	Postural instability and falls are commonly seen because of aging and motor disabilities. This study aims to assess the posture-related changes in brain functional connectivity by wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of oxyhemoglobin concentration change (Δ[HbO2]) signals measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in elderly subjects. The NIRS signals were continuously recorded from the prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas in 39 healthy elderly subjects and 22 young healthy subjects during 20min resting and 10min standing states. Eight connection types were obtained from the recorded brain areas. The WPCO were calculated in five frequency intervals in each channel pair as follows: I, 0.6-2Hz; II, 0.145-0.6Hz; III, 0.052-0.145Hz; IV, 0.021-0.052Hz; and V, 0.0095-0.021Hz. Results show that posture change and age significantly interacts with the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left sensorimotor cortex (SMC) connectivity in interval V (F=5.010, p=0.028). The left and right…
7075930	Rotor's syndrome: a study on variations in pigment metabolism with age.	aging	1982-??-??	The effects of aging on the pigment metabolism in Rotor's syndrome were investigated in six cases examined at least twice at an average interval of 10.5 +/- 6.5 years and additional four cases examined only once. No significant increase was found in the total (TB) or direct (DB) bilirubin in serum. However, indirect bilirubin increased significantly from 1.21 +/- 0.72 mg/dl to 2.28 +/- 1.00 mg/dl (p less than 0.05) and DB/TB ratio (% Direct) decreased significantly from 77.3 +/- 6.6% to 64.4 +/- 8.7% (p less than 0.05). BSP retentions at 45 minutes increased significantly from 26.8 +/- 10.9% to 45.3 +/- 14.9% (p less than 0.05). A significant positive correlation between the values of BSP retained at 45 minutes and the age was also observed (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the pigment metabolism in Rotor's syndrome deteriorates with the age.
8473516	Dietary induced subclinical vitamin K deficiency in normal human subjects.	aging	1993-04-??	A subclinical vitamin K deficiency was induced in 32 healthy subjects (four groups of eight males and females) aged 20-40 and 60-80 yr residing in the Metabolic Research Unit of the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Volunteers were initially fed (4 d) a baseline-period diet containing the recommended daily allowance for vitamin K which is equivalent to 80 micrograms/d of phylloquinone (vitamin K1). During the baseline period various parameters of vitamin K nutritional status were monitored. The baseline period was followed by a 13-d depletion period during which the subjects were fed a very low vitamin K1 diet (approximately 10 micrograms/d). After depletion, the subjects entered a 16-d repletion period (four stages lasting 4 d each) during which time they were repleted with 5, 15, 25, and 45 micrograms of vitamin K1 per day. Vitamin K1 depletion dramatically and significantly decreased plasma vitamin K1 levels (P < 0.0001) in both elderly and young groups t…
1905495	Acute phase response in exercise. II. Associations between vitamin E, cytokines, and muscle proteolysis.	aging	1991-06-??	Cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) mediate a variety of host responses to trauma and infection, including skeletal muscle proteolysis. This investigation assesses the influence of damaging eccentric exercise on in vitro production and plasma concentrations of cytokines and their relationship to muscle protein breakdown. In a double-blind placebo-controlled protocol, 21 male subjects took vitamin E supplements (800 IU/day) for 48 days, then ran downhill on an inclined treadmill. Twenty-four hours after this single session of eccentric exercise, endotoxin-induced secretion of IL-1 beta was augmented 154% (P less than 0.01) in cells obtained from the placebo subjects, but no significant exercise-related changes were observed in cells from the vitamin E-supplemented subjects. TNF-alpha secretion was also significantly increased 24 h after exercise, but the response was not inhibited by vitamin E. In contrast, IL-6 secre…
15321819	Associations of empirically derived eating patterns with plasma lipid biomarkers: a comparison of factor and cluster analysis methods.	aging	2004-09-??	BACKGROUND: Despite the growing use of patterning methods in nutritional epidemiology, a direct comparison of factor and cluster analysis methods has not been performed.    OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to compare patterns derived from the cluster and factor analysis procedures with measures of plasma lipids.    DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 459 healthy subjects who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and had measures of diet and plasma lipids. Eating patterns were derived by using both factor and cluster analysis methods.    RESULTS: In separate multivariate-adjusted regression models, subjects in the healthy cluster had lower plasma triacylglycerols than did those not in the healthy cluster (beta = -15.97; 95% CI: -29.51, -2.43; P < 0.05), and factor 1 (reduced-fat dairy products, fruit, and fiber) was inversely related to plasma triacylglycerols (beta = -7.02 mg/dL for a one-unit increase in z score; 95% CI: -12.92, -1.12; P < 0.05). Those in …
23219676	An fMRI study of episodic encoding across the lifespan: changes in subsequent memory effects are evident by middle-age.	lifespan, aging	2013-02-??	Although it is well-documented that there are age differences between young and older adults in neural activity associated with successful memory formation (positive subsequent memory effects), little is known about how this activation differs across the lifespan, as few studies have included middle-aged adults. The present study investigated the effect of age on neural activity during episodic encoding using a cross-sectional lifespan sample (20-79 years old, N=192) from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study. We report four major findings. First, in a contrast of remembered vs. forgotten items, a decrease in neural activity occurred with age in bilateral occipito-temporo-parietal regions. Second, when we contrasted forgotten with remembered items (negative subsequent memory), the primary difference was found between middle and older ages. Third, there was evidence for age equivalence in hippocampal regions, congruent with previous studies. Finally, low-memory-performers showed negative subs…
11247117	Is melatonin circadian rhythm a physiological feature associated with healthy longevity? A study of long-living subjects and their progeny.	longevity	2001-01-??	The study investigates the circadian rhythm (CR) of urinary 6-sulphatoxy-melatonin (aMT6s) in long-living (longevous) subjects and their progeny. The aim is to detect whether or not the melatonin CR is a physiological feature associated with healthy longevity. The aMT6s CR was investigated in 10 longevous subjects, 8 of their children and 9 of their grandchildren, all in good health. Control data were obtained respectively from 13 adult subjects and 9 young subjects, in good health, but characterized by a negative family history for longevity. All the subjects were born and living in the same city. The study was performed in the summer of 1996. The aMT6s CR was found to persist in longevous subjects, being characterized by a lower mesor and amplitude. The aMT6s CR was found not to show properties consistently different in children and grandchildren as compared respectively to their adult and young controls. Because of its preservation in longevous subjects, it can be argued that the me…
6436639	The gonadotropin-suppressive activity of androgen is increased in elderly men.	aging	1984-11-??	The influence of aging on the responsiveness to sex steroid hormones in men was studied by comparing circulating gonadotropin concentrations, pulsatile LH release, and sex hormone-binding globulin (TeBG) levels. This was done before and during a four-day continuous infusion of testosterone (T) (7.5 mg/d), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (7.0 mg/d), or estradiol (E2) (45 micrograms/d) in young adult men, ages 18 to 32, and healthy elderly men, ages 65 to 80. DHT reduced mean serum LH and FSH levels as well as the frequency of spontaneous LH secretory episodes to a greater extent (p less than 0.05) in old men than in young men. T administration also reduced serum LH levels more in aged than in young men (P less than 0.05); however, this difference was less pronounced than for DHT. During T infusion, the decrease in serum FSH levels was similar in the two groups. Spontaneous LH pulse amplitude also declined during both T and DHT infusion in aged, but not in young men. By contrast, infusion of E…
7358830	Age-related changes of calcitonin secretion in females.	aging	1980-03-??	Calcitonin secretion was studied in 50 normal females from 20--69 yr of age, with 10 subjects in each decade. Hormone measurements were made by RIA during response to a 10-min infusion of calcium (as the chloride salt) at 3 mg/kg BW. There was a progressive decrease of the calcium-stimulated plasma calcitonin with age. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant (P less than 0.05) negative correlation (r = 0.29) between calcitonin response and age. Postmenopausal females had a significantly (P less than 0.01) smaller calcitonin response than premenopausal females. The time of maximum calcitonin response progressively shifted from 10 min in the younger subjects to 20 min in the older subjects. These studies demonstrated that calcitonin secretion decreases with age in females. This decrease may play some role in the pathogenesis of the progressive loss of bone mass which occurs with aging in females.
3800490	Plasma lipids and composition of red cells in four cases of Werner's syndrome.	aging	1986-10-??	Four cases of accelerated aging, known as Werner's syndrome (WS), are presented. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein findings and lipid compositions of red cell membranes are compared to those of old and young healthy people. Typical clinical findings, as reported in the literature, confirmed the diagnosis. Furthermore, an elevated osmotic fragility of red blood cells (RBC) was observed. RBC membranes of WS patients showed phospholipid concentrations similar to those found in people aged over 70 years, which have been reported to be lower than those of mature donors aged below 30 years. Fatty acid patterns of RBC membranes and plasma phospholipids were indicative of some disturbance in phospholipid subclass distributions in WS-patients.
3121487	Role of aging on growth hormone and prolactin release after growth hormone-releasing hormone and domperidone in man.	aging	1987-??-??	Growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion after GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and domperidone (DOM), an antidopaminergic drug which does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), was evaluated in 8 healthy elderly men (65-91 years) and in 7 young adults (23-40 years). All received in random order at 2-day intervals: GHRH(1-40) (50 micrograms i.v.) bolus, DOM (5 mg/h) infusion, GHRH(1-40) (50 micrograms i.v.) plus DOM (5 mg/h i.v.), saline solution. In elderly men GH increase after GHRH was significantly lower than in young men. DOM alone did not change GH secretion in either of these groups, whereas it increased the GH response to GHRH only in young adults. PRL levels increased in both young and elderly men during both DOM and GHRH plus DOM, but the PRL release was more marked in young than in elderly men. Both integrated secretion of GH after GHRH and of PRL after DOM were inversely correlated to chronological age. Our data show an impairment of GH rise after GHRH and of PRL afte…
20564557	SAXS and SANS observations of abnormal aggregation of human alpha-crystallin.	aging	2010-06-??	Aggregation states of human alpha-crystallins are observed complementarily using small-angle X-ray and small-angle neutron scatterings (SAXS and SANS). Infant alpha-crystallin is almost a monodispersed system of the aggregates with gyration radius of ca. 60 A, which is a normal aggregate. On the other hand, the aged and cataract alpha-crystallins have not only the normal but also the larger aggregates. In the aged alpha-crystallin, the normal aggregate is a major component, but in the cataract alpha-crystallin the larger ones are dominant. Both alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins, which are subunits of alpha-crystallin, also form an aggregate with the size close to the normal aggregate. Under UV irradiation, only aggregates of alpha B-crystallin undergo further aggregation. Therefore, considering increase of ratio of alpha B-crystallin in the aggregate of alpha-crystallin as aging, the abnormal aggregation (formation of the huge aggregates) mainly results in the further aggregation of alp…
7766694	Identification and synthetic pathway of sialyl-Lewisx-containing neolacto-series gangliosides in lens tissues. 1. Characterization of gangliosides in human senile cataractous lens.	aging	1995-05-17	Human lens accumulates gangliosides in association with aging and senile cataract progression. In this study we purified and characterized five major gangliosides in human cataractous lenses. Structural analyses and immunological studies revealed the presence of ganglio-series gangliosides, GM3, GM2, GM1 and GD1a, and a sialyl-Lewisx-containing neolacto-series ganglioside, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1ceramide (IV3NeuAcIII3FucnLc4). Slow-moving gangliosides, although minor components, were also found to have sialyl-Lewisx-related structures, based on anti-Lewisx antiserum binding to their asialo forms. However, sialyl-paragloboside, a possible precursor of the sialyl-Lewisx ganglioside, was not identified.
6875154	The correlation of increased serum prolactin levels with decreased sexual desire and activity in elderly men.	aging	1983-08-??	Serum prolactin levels and sexual function were evaluated in 28 men from 60 to 64 years of age and in 44 men from 65 to 70 years of age. All subjects were married, physically healthy, and had no psychopathology or marital problem. About a third of the men aged 60 to 70 years suffered from impotence. No obvious correlation between elevated levels of serum prolactin and impotence was obtained. Subjects aged 65 to 70 who had decreased libido exhibited a significant elevation of serum prolactin levels, while subjects of the same age group who had reserved (normal) libido appeared to have low serum prolactin levels. Nine of ten men aged 60 to 70 years with serum prolactin levels above 40 ng/ml reported decreased libido. Potent men of both age groups (60-70 years) with high prolactin levels showed a tendency to have a decrease in frequency of sexual intercourse. Thus, it seems that mild hyperprolactinemia in aging men may be associated with decreased sexual desire and frequency of sexual act…
24801222	Reward anticipation in the adolescent and aging brain.	lifespan, aging	2014-10-??	Processing of reward is the basis of adaptive behavior of the human being. Neural correlates of reward processing seem to be influenced by developmental changes from adolescence to late adulthood. The aim of this study is to uncover these neural correlates during a slot machine gambling task across the lifespan. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate 102 volunteers in three different age groups: 34 adolescents, 34 younger adults, and 34 older adults. We focused on the core reward areas ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), the valence processing associated areas, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, as well as information integration associated areas, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Results showed that VS and VMPFC were characterized by a hyperactivation in adolescents compared with younger adults. Furthermore, the ACC and insula were characterized by a U-shape pattern (hypoa…
3901781	Cardiopulmonary blood volume and plasma renin activity in normal and hypertensive humans.	aging	1985-10-??	Plasma renin activity (PRA) and systemic and forearm hemodynamics were studied during acute changes in cardiopulmonary blood volume and central venous pressure in 20 subjects, including 9 normotensive controls and 11 essential hypertensive patients of the same age. Changes in cardiopulmonary blood volume and central venous pressure were induced by a "head-down" tilt and thigh-cuff inflation. Blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate did not change during cardiopulmonary blood volume variations, whereas significant changes in cardiac output, forearm blood flow, and PRA were observed. A significant negative correlation between cardiopulmonary blood volume (CPBV) and PRA existed, and slope of this correlation of delta PRA/delta CPBV was estimated as a sensitivity index of control of renin release. Sensitivity of neural control of renin release was not statistically different in normal subjects and hypertensive patients. In two groups, sensitivity of this reflex mechanism similarly de…
12297335	Osteoclastogenic potential of bone marrow cells increases with age in elderly women with fracture.	aging	2002-07-??	The most reliable explanation for decreasing bone mass in elderly women is an imbalance of osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic formation resulting from a relative increase in osteoclastic resorption. However, it is not clear whether an increase in osteoclastic bone resorption with age is due to increased osteoclast formation or to osteoclastic bone resorption activity. In this study, using a human bone marrow culture system, we attempt to clarify the increase in osteoclast formation with age. The mononuclear cell-rich fraction from bone marrow, obtained from the proximal region of the femur from female elderly patients with fracture, were cultured for 14 days in the presence of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were counted as osteoclasts. In our investigation, human osteoclast formation in the bone marrow culture increased with age in elderly women (age 64-96 years). The osteoclast formation was positively correlated wit…
3489030	Effects of fasting on ketone body concentrations in healthy men of different ages.	aging	1986-09-??	This work was performed to assess age effects on fasting-induced hyperketonemia and to determine if measurement of cerebral glucose utilization by positron emission tomography after 6 to 8 hr of fasting is associated with hyperketonemia that could influence cerebral glucose metabolism. Acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were assayed in venous blood from healthy men of various ages, subjected to an 18-hr fast. At 18 hr of fasting but not at 14 hr or earlier, 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were correlated significantly with age; concentrations of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were significantly higher than at earlier times in the fast, p less than or equal to .05, with elevations of 82% and 214% over baseline, respectively. Acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were higher on the day when cerebral glucose utilization was determined than after a comparable fast at another time. The observed level of hyperketonemia, however, would not substantially influence cerebral glu…
21057376	Development of cytomegalovirus and adenovirus-specific memory CD4 T-cell functions from birth to adulthood.	aging	2011-02-??	Age-related changes in memory CD4 T cells (CD4) are poorly known. To address this issue, CD4 proliferative and cytokine responses to an anti-CD3 monoclonal (CD3), to cytomegalovirus (CMV), and to adenovirus (AdV) were assessed in 57 children (age, 0.07-17.16 y) and 17 adults. Results showed i) accumulation of memory CD4 with aging, with 2-3 times more central-memory T cell (TCM; CD45RA/CD62L) than effector-memory T cell (TEM; CD45RA/62L) CD4 at any age. ii) In children older than 2 y, CMV-specific CD4-secreting IFNγ alone predominated over CD4-secreting IL2 + IFNγ and a continuous increase, with aging, in IFNγ responses to the virus was observed. In contrast, in AdV infection, CD4-secreting IL2 + IFNγ predominated and IFNγ responses to the virus reached adult levels from 3 y of age. iii) In children aged 0-2 y, lower total IFNγ responses to CMV (p < 0.02), AdV (p = 0.05), and CD3 (p < 0.01) and lower IFNγ + IL2-responses (p = 0.1, p < 0.02, p < 0.05, respectively) contrasted with no de…
15879917	Sequential classification of endocrine stages during reproductive aging in women: the FREEDOM study.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Reproductive aging involves complex endocrine changes affecting women's fertility, health, and well-being; however, understanding of the specific changes involved is limited by the lack of detailed quantitative studies. We undertook a thorough study with the aim of characterizing the different endocrine stages involved in female reproductive aging.    DESIGN: FREEDOM is a cohort study designed to determine the endocrine changes during reproductive aging in women. Here, we ascertained the different endocrine patterns in a representative population and developed a staging system. In this study, 112 women aged 30 to 58 years collected daily urine samples over a 6- to 18-month period and recorded their menstrual periods. A total of 36,786 samples were analyzed for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, estrone 3-glucuronide, and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide.    RESULTS: A classification of five sequential endocrine stages of reproductive aging was developed: stag…
25729253	Correlation between the serum luteinizing hormone to folliclestimulating hormone ratio and the anti-Müllerian hormone levels in normo-ovulatory women.	aging	2015-03-??	Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels are regarded as an age-specific marker for predicting the ovarian reserve in women of reproductive age. Some studies have shown that the luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio can be used as a predictor of ovarian reserve. The purpose of this study was to assess the variation of LH/FSH ratio with aging and to evaluate the correlation between serum LH/FSH ratio and AMH levels as a predictor of the ovarian reserve in normo-ovulatory women. We retrospectively analyzed the day 3 serum hormone levels in 1,251 patients (age range: 20-50 yr) between January 2010 and January 2011. We divided the patients into 6 groups according to their age. Relation between serum AMH level and LH/FSH ratio was analyzed statistically. The serum AMH level was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.400, P < 0.001). A significant negative correlation was found between serum LH/FSH ratio and age (r = -0.213, P < 0.001). There was a significant par…
7679182	Role of growth factors in the human endometrium during aging.	aging	1993-01-??	The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in physiological and pathological changes of the endometrial tissue during aging. Thirty-four patients undergoing hysterectomy were divided into three groups: (A) premenopausal women with regular menses, (B) pre-menopausal women with irregular bleeding and (C) post-menopausal women. Endometrial samples were collected after the removal of uterus and were used for immunohistochemical evaluation of EGF, EGF receptor (EGFr) and IGF-I and also for Northern blot analysis of IGF-I gene expression. Plasma levels of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), D4-androstenedione (D4-A) and oestrone (E1) were also assayed. The immunohistochemical scores (HSCORES) for EGF, EGFr and IGF-I were significantly higher in groups A and B than in group C. Independently from the menstrual history, significantly higher HSCORES of EGF, EGFr and IGF-I were present in hyperplastic endometrium th…
20048194	Vascular endothelial function is related to white blood cell count and myeloperoxidase among healthy middle-aged and older adults.	aging	2010-02-??	Endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) is impaired with aging, but there is significant variability among healthy middle-aged and older adults. We tested the hypothesis that EDD is related to white blood cell (WBC) count in healthy men and women aged 55 to 75 years (n=48) who have a WBC count within the clinically normal range. The peak forearm blood flow response to intrabrachial artery infusion of acetylcholine was inversely related to WBC count (r=-0.38; P=0.004) and was 34% smaller in subjects with higher versus lower WBC count (more versus less than the median of 5.0x10(9) cells per liter; P=0.001). Vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to NO (peak forearm blood flow response to sodium nitroprusside) was inversely related to WBC count (r=-0.30; P=0.02) but did not fully explain the associations with EDD. Inhibition of NO with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine reduced EDD in subjects with lower (-56%; P=0.01) but not higher WBC count. Tetrahydrobiopterin selectively improved EDD in subjects…
10714939	Growth factor receptor gene and protein expressions in the human lens.	aging	2000-02-15	In this study the mRNAs encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-2) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR-1) genes of the human normal lenses at ages varying from 0.5 to 72 years, were identified by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Regulation of EGFR gene expression in the lens did not change with aging, and of FGFR-2 and IGFR-1 genes also remained unaltered up to age 53 years. However, expressions of FGFR-2 and IGFR-1 genes were decreased at ages above 60 years. EGFR, FGFR-2 and IGFR-1 proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis in the epithelial cell membranes of lens at age varying from 40 to 72 years. There was no detectable amount of EGFR protein in fiber cell membranes of the lens, and the levels of FGFR-2 and IGFR-1 proteins were much lower than those in the epithelial cell membranes. The low levels of these receptor proteins in the fiber cell membranes of lens, suggest the…
10698358	Acetylcholinesterase activity in chronic renal failure.	aging	2000-01-21	Twenty healthy subjects and 39 Chronic Renal Failure patients (CRF-patients) maintained on chronic hemodialysis were used in this investigation to study the changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of red blood cells (RBCs). The CRF-patients were all undergoing hemodialysis treatment. AChE activity from the CRF-patients was determined before and after dialysis. An additional objective was to study the effect of chronic renal failure on human red blood cell aging. Blood samples were drawn from controls and CRF-patients in tubes containing EDTA or sodium heparin as an anticoagulant. Red blood cells were purified to avoid interference with monocytes, reticulocytes and leukocytes. The purified RBCs were subfractionated into young (y) (1.08-1.09), mid (m) (1.09-1.11) and old (o) (1.11-1.12) percoll density (g/mL) fractions using a discontinous percoll gradient. The mean +/- SD AChE per gram hemoglobin (U/g Hgb) activities in whole blood (WB), purified human red blood cells (PRBCs), y…
27432370	Factors Associated with Healthy Aging among Older Persons in Northeastern Thailand.	aging	2016-12-??	The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with perceived health and healthy aging among older people in northeastern Thailand. Thailand's aging population is growing and facing an increasing old-age dependency ratio. Northeastern Thailand, known as Isan, is a region in which the number of older residents is projected to grow rapidly. Older people in this region are likely to confront great threats to their health and well-being. These issues require appropriate attention and actions to promote healthy aging. However, healthy aging in this region has not been studied. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 453 older people, aged 60 years or older. Participants completed the Healthy Aging Instrument (HAI) and provided relevant demographic characteristics. Mann-Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and multiple regression models were used to analyze the data. Through comparative analyses, significant differences in HAI scores were observed for the following fa…
15255449	Effect of age on plasma homocysteine concentrations in young and elderly subjects considering serum vitamin concentrations and different lifestyle factors.	aging	2004-03-??	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether an increase in total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration with increasing age is due to diminishing serum concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), vitamin B-12, and folate. The possible influence of different lifestyle factors on tHcy concentration was considered.    METHODS: Plasma tHcy, serum concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate, vitamin B-12, and folate, intake of coffee and tea, alcohol, and methionine, as well as cigarette smoking, were determined in 252 elderly subjects (60-87 years old) of the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population in Giessen (GISELA) and 99 young adults (20-34 years old) of the study on health and nutrition of young adults (GEJE).    RESULTS: Mean plasma tHcy concentrations were significantly higher in elderly than in young female subjects (9.7 +/- 1.9 micromol/L vs. 9.0 +/- 1.6 micromol/L, p < 0.05), but there was no difference between elderly and young men (10…
9147371	HLA and longevity or aging among Shanghai Chinese.	longevity, aging	1997-03-??	Twenty-two centenarians and one hundred and seventy-nine nonagenarians (mean age 93 +/- 1.04 years) in the Shanghai Region of China were phenotyped for alleles of A (13 types), B (21 types) and C (6 types) loci of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA). The frequencies of HLA antigens were compared with 211 healthy adults whose ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. It was observed that A9 was highly associated with longevity (frequency in the longevity group is 38%, the control group 24%, P = 0.002). A30 showed marked inverse correlation (frequency in the longevity group is 8%, the control group 17%, P = 0.008). Cw3, Cw6 and Cw7 were also inversely correlated (P = 0.02, 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Thus, it is likely that A9 may contribute to longevity while A30, Cw3, Cw6 and Cw7 may be associated with aging. The average superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents of erythrocytes in 48 cases with the HLA-A9 (without A30) antigen in the longevity group and in 13 cases with the HLA-A30 (without A9) antig…
25957060	Perspectives on the Etiology of Violence in Later Life.	aging	2016-??-??	This article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for explaining the etiology of violence in later life by various groups involved in the field of elder abuse. In this study, we explore this through eight focus groups with different professionals involved in the field of elder abuse and older persons themselves and in interviews with 35 experts in the field. Our findings show that dependency, vulnerability, power and control, social isolation, stress, and care burden play a central role in their explanations for the occurrence of violence in later life. The role of a history of violence in violence in later life is equivocal. The complexity and ambiguity of dependency and vulnerability, the notion of mutual dependency, and diverse attitudes and expectations toward them that arise with the aging process are distinct features of violence in later life that were found.
24649827	Tor-Sch9 deficiency activates catabolism of the ketone body-like acetic acid to promote trehalose accumulation and longevity.	longevity, lifespan	2014-06-??	In mammals, extended periods of fasting leads to the accumulation of blood ketone bodies including acetoacetate. Here we show that similar to the conversion of leucine to acetoacetate in fasting mammals, starvation conditions induced ketone body-like acetic acid generation from leucine in S. cerevisiae. Whereas wild-type and ras2Δ cells accumulated acetic acid, long-lived tor1Δ and sch9Δ mutants rapidly depleted it through a mitochondrial acetate CoA transferase-dependent mechanism, which was essential for lifespan extension. The sch9Δ-dependent utilization of acetic acid also required coenzyme Q biosynthetic genes and promoted the accumulation of intracellular trehalose. These results indicate that Tor-Sch9 deficiency extends longevity by switching cells to an alternative metabolic mode, in which acetic acid can be utilized for the storage of stress resistance carbon sources. These effects are reminiscent of those described for ketone bodies in fasting mammals and raise the possibilit…
14637002	Gene expression profiling of human satellite cells during muscular aging using cDNA arrays.	lifespan, aging	2003-12-04	It is well established that biological aging is associated with functional deficits at the cellular, tissue, organ and system levels, but the molecular mechanisms that control lifespan and age-related phenotypes are still not well understood. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying myoblast aging, we have used quantitative hybridization of a cDNA array of 2016 clones from a human skeletal muscle 3'-end cDNA library to monitor gene expression patterns of myoblasts of individuals with different ages (5 days old, 52 years old and 79 years old) and at different stages of proliferation (early, presenescent and senescent). We have shown that expression profiles in satellite cells vary with donor age, with an up-regulation of genes involved in muscle structure, muscle differentiation and in metabolism in the newborn, and a down-regulation of genes involved in protein renewal in adults. We have also observed that myoblasts isolated from subjects of different ages have typic…
22338612	Executive summary of the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop +10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging.	aging	2012-04-??	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to summarize the recommended updates to the 2001 Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria. The 2011 STRAW +10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period.    METHODS: Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antimüllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus.    RESULTS: STRAW +10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage -3) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transi…
28762199	Age-dependent alterations in serum cytokines, peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production, natural killer cell activity, and prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub>.	aging	2017-??-??	This study aimed to determine age-dependent alterations in serum cytokines, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F (PGF). Nine hundred eighty-seven healthy and nonobese subjects were divided into five age groups: 20-34 (group 1), 35-44 (group 2), 45-54 (group 3), 55-64 (group 4), and 65-80 (group 5) years of age. After adjusting for BMI, sex, and smoking and drinking status, serum interferon (IFN)-γ levels decreased in groups 3, 4, and 5 compared with those in groups 1 and 2. Production of IFN-γ by unstimulated PBMCs was lower in the older groups (groups 4 and 5) than in the younger groups (groups 1 and 3). Serum interleukin (IL)-12 was lower in group 5 than in groups 1 and 2. In contrast, both serum and PBMC IL-6 were higher in group 5 than in groups 1, 2, and 3. Urinary 8-epi-PGF increased in group 3 compared with that in group 1 and further increased in group 5. Multiple linear regression ana…
27878970	Association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and telomere length and C-reactive protein from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-1999-2002.	aging	2017-??-??	SCOPE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging. This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) has an impact on telomere shortening in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also carried out validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).    METHODS AND RESULTS: Data came from NHANES 1999-2002. LTL and CRP were assayed from leukocyte DNA and serum specimens, respectively. The DII was calculated from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear regression for log-transformed LTL. After multivariable adjustment, higher DII scores (i.e. relatively more pro inflammatory) were associated with shorter LTL both when used as continuous (b  =  -0.003; 95% confidence interval [CI]  =  -0.005, -0.0002) and as quartiles (b   =  -0.013; 95% CI  =  -0.025, -0.001; P …
3910032	Analysis of immunoreactive insulins in man in relation to the effects of aging.	aging	1985-10-??	In order to elucidate the effects of aging on insulin content in human pancreas, the immunoelectrophoretic analysis of insulin was applied. The pancreas of senile humans appears to contain less total immunoreactive insulin, because of the decrement of proinsulin fraction after overnight fasting. The results suggest the involvement of insulin biosynthesis according to the aging process.
25617181	A genetic-demographic approach reveals a gender-specific association of SLC6A3/DAT1 40 bp-VNTR with life-expectancy.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2015-06-??	Several recent lines of evidence are proving an important role for dopamine in the aging process and in the determination of life span. Components of the dopaminergic system may represent good candidates for longevity studies. Herein, we tested the possible association of the functional SLC6A3/DAT1 40-bp VNTR with life-expectancy in a healthy population of Central Italy (N = 993) by applying a genetic-demographic approach that takes into account the demographic information and different survival rates between sexes for modeling the survival of specific allele carriers in the population. Male carriers of S*/S* genotype showed a lower survival chance across most of the lifespan respect to the survival of DAT1*L-carriers (P = 0.021). The same analyses gave non-significant results in females. Several studies already reported significant sex differences in dopamine metabolism and its related biological pathways. Thus, we can hypothesize that the SLC6A3/DAT1 40 bp-VNTR may affect life expect…
25840344	In vitro 3-D model based on extending time of culture for studying chronological epidermis aging.	aging	2015-09-??	Skin aging is a complex phenomenon in which several mechanisms operate simultaneously. Among them, intrinsic aging is a time-dependent process, which leads to gradual skin changes affecting its structure and function such as thinning down of both epidermal and dermal compartments and a flattening and fragility of the dermo-epidermal junction. Today, several approaches have been proposed for the generation of aged skin in vitro, including skin explants from aged donors and three-dimensional skin equivalent treated by aging-inducing chemical compounds or engineered with human cells isolated from aged donors. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new in vitro model of aging based on skin equivalent demonstrating the same phenotypic changes that were observed in chronological aging. By using prolonged culture as a proxy for cellular aging, we extended to 120 days the culture time of a skin equivalent model based on collagen-glycosaminoglycan-chitosan porous polymer and engine…
19470626	Circulating dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations during the menopausal transition.	aging	2009-08-??	CONTEXT: A previous report from the Study of Women Across the Nation indicated a rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) during the menopausal transition using data from three annual visits.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine changes in DHEAS with chronological and ovarian aging, expanding the original analyses to include 10 yr of annual data.    DESIGN: A longitudinal observational study and cross-sectional analyses of baseline data were conducted. OUTCOME MEASURES AND SUBJECTS: DHEAS, age, menopause status, ethnicity, smoking, weight, and height were assessed in 2886 women from five ethnic groups aged 42-52 yr at entry. Hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and hormone use were excluded.    RESULTS: Cross-sectional analysis at baseline showed a linear decline in circulating log-transformed DHEAS with increasing age for either the entire cohort (2.81% per year) or for individual ethnicities. A similar negative association with baseline age (2.44% decline per year) was s…
20394788	Variation of human natural killer cell phenotypes with age: identification of a unique KLRG1-negative subset.	aging	2010-07-??	Human natural killer (NK) cells subsets are phenotypically characterized by their lack of CD3 and low/high expression of CD56. This study revealed an age-associated increase in the ratio of CD3(-)CD56(dim) to CD3(-)CD56(bright) NK cells, whereas distinct expression patterns of CD2, CD16, CD57, and the C-type lectin family members killer cell lectin-like receptor -D1 (CD94) and -G1 (KLRG1), were noted on both these NK and the CD3(+)CD56(+) T cell subsets; moreover, CD94 and KLRG1 expression were significantly reduced with age. Although the proportion of CD3(-)CD56(bright) NK cells vs CD3(-)CD56(dim) cells decreased with age, the percentage of CD3(-)CD56(bright) cells expressing IFN-gamma after activation significantly increased, potentially representing compensatory augmentation of cytokine production to maintain the important immunoregulatory role of these cells in older individuals. Collectively, these results highlight new evidence for a continuum of change during immunologic aging a…
26347008	Outdoor motivation moderates the effects of accessibility on mobility in old age.	aging	2016-07-??	BACKGROUND: Mobility plays a major role in healthy aging and social participation. This study explored whether accessibility problems in the housing environment are negatively associated with mobility in old age and whether this association is moderated by differences in an individual's preference for spending time outside the home (outdoor motivation).    MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article reports the results of a research project on mobility in old age. The project included a survey study of 120 community-dwelling older adults between 59 and 92 years of age (mean = 71.7 years, SD = 7.3 years) living in the metropolitan region of Nuremberg, Germany. Objective assessments were conducted in the participants' housing environment to evaluate the magnitude of accessibility problems.    RESULTS: Accessibility problems were negatively associated with mobility. Interaction analyses suggested a buffering effect of outdoor motivation on this association, i.e. participants who reported a prefere…
10841212	Sleep impairments in healthy seniors: roles of stress, cortisol, and interleukin-1 beta.	aging	2000-05-??	STUDY OBJECTIVES: Increased stress responsivity and a longer-lasting glucocorticoid increase are common findings in aging studies. Increased cortisol levels at the circadian nadir also accompany aging. We used 24 h free urine cortisol to assess these age changes in healthy seniors. We hypothesized that free cortisol levels would explain individual differences in age-related sleep impairments.    DESIGN: The study compared sleep, cortisol, and sleep-cortisol correlations under baseline and "stress" conditions in men and women.    SETTING: Subjects were studied in the General Clinical Research Center under baseline conditions and a mildly stressful procedure (24 h indwelling intravenous catheter placement).    PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight healthy, nonobese subjects (60 women and 28 men) from a large study of successful aging participated in the study. Mean ages were 70.6 (+/-6.2) and 72.3 (+/-5.7) years for women and men, respectively.    MEASUREMENTS: The 24 h urines were collected for co…
22371086	Age-related neural differences in affiliation and isolation.	aging	2012-06-??	While previous aging studies have focused on particular components of social perception (e.g., theory of mind, self-referencing), little is known about age-related differences specifically for the neural basis of perception of affiliation and isolation. This study investigates age-related similarities and differences in the neural basis of affiliation and isolation. Participants viewed images of affiliation (groups engaged in social interaction) and isolation (lone individuals), as well as nonsocial stimuli (e.g., landscapes), while making pleasantness judgments and undergoing functional neuroimaging (BOLD fMRI). Results indicated age-related similarities in response to affiliation and isolation in recruitment of regions involved in theory of mind and self-referencing (e.g., temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). Yet age-related differences also emerged in response to affiliation and isolation in regions implicated in the theory of mind, as well as self-referencing. Specifically, in…
10530790	Effect of age on DNA binding of the ku protein in irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).	aging	1999-08-??	DNA binding of the ku protein was investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 24 subjects of different ages (20-89 years old) displaying age-related changes in DNA repair, mitotic responsiveness, and cytokine production. Ku is an heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits of 70 and 80 kDa, which is involved in the earliest steps of DNA damage recognition. DNA binding of ku 70/80 was found unchanged in normal PBMC from aging subjects but progressively declined in x-ray-irradiated PBMC from young to adult, and elderly subjects. This finding was concomitant with the age-related fall of DNA repair in the whole population.
23370289	Cumulative lead exposure in community-dwelling adults and fine motor function: comparing standard and novel tasks in the VA normative aging study.	aging	2013-03-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lead exposure in children and occupationally exposed adults has been associated with reduced visuomotor and fine motor function. However, associations in environmentally exposed adults remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we examined the association between cumulative lead exposure-as measured by lead in bone-and performance on the grooved pegboard (GP) manual dexterity task, as well as on handwriting tasks using a novel assessment approach, among men in the VA Normative Aging Study (NAS).    METHODS: GP testing was done with 362 NAS participants, and handwriting assessment with 328, who also had tibia and patella lead measurements made with K-X-Ray Fluorescence (KXRF). GP scores were time (s) to complete the task with the dominant hand. The handwriting assessment approach assessed the production of signature and cursive lowercase l and m letter samples. Signature and lm task scores reflect consistency in repeated trials. We used linear regression to esti…
6417155	Age-related changes in plasma growth hormone response to growth hormone-releasing factor in man.	aging	1984-01-??	The response of plasma growth hormone to synthetic growth hormone-releasing factor (hpGRF-44) administered intravenously was examined in normal men of various ages ranging from 20 to 75 years. Most of the subjects who were over forty years old had either no or much lower response of plasma growth hormone to hpGRF-44. In contrast plasma growth hormone increased markedly after hpGRF-44 injection in all men in their twenties and thirties. The mean peak level of plasma GH following hpGRF-44 administration was 29.6 +/- 20.4 (SD) ng/ml in men in their twenties, 30.2 +/- 26.5 ng/ml in their thirties, 9.7 +/- 5.2 ng/ml in their forties, 10.9 +/- 5.4 ng/ml in their fifties, 8.4 +/- 4.8 ng/ml in their sixties and 8.1 +/- 7.5 ng/ml in their seventies. These results suggest that somatotroph cells become less sensitive to growth hormone-releasing factor with aging.
20398119	Serum lipid levels and cognitive change in late life.	aging	2010-03-??	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of lipids and lipoproteins on longitudinal cognitive performance and cognitive health in late life and to consider moderating factors such as age and sex that may clarify conflicting prior evidence.    DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.    SETTING: A 16-year longitudinal study of health and cognitive aging.    PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred nineteen adults from the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging aged 50 and older at first cognitive testing, including 21 twin pairs discordant for dementia.    MEASUREMENTS: Up to five occasions of cognitive measurements encompassing verbal, spatial, memory, and perceptual speed domains across a 16-year span; baseline serum lipids and lipoproteins including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo)A1, apoB, total serum cholesterol, and triglycerides.    RESULTS: The effect of lipids on cognitive change was most evident before age 65. In women, higher HDL-C and lower apoB and triglycerides predict…
25541365	Age differences in brain activity related to unsuccessful declarative memory retrieval.	aging	2015-07-01	Although memory recall is known to be reduced with normal aging, little is known about the patterns of brain activity that accompany these recall failures. By assessing faulty memory, we can identify the brain regions engaged during retrieval attempts in the absence of successful memory and determine the impact of aging on this functional activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine age differences in brain activity associated with memory failure in three memory retrieval tasks: autobiographical (AM), episodic (EM) and semantic (SM). Compared to successful memory retrieval, both age groups showed more activity when they failed to recall a memory in regions consistent with the salience network (SLN), a brain network also associated with non-memory errors. Both groups also showed strong functional coupling among SLN regions during incorrect trials and in intrinsic patterns of functional connectivity. In comparison to young adults, older adults demonstrated (1) less …
6851054	Effects of aging on changing arterial compliance and left ventricular load in a northern Chinese urban community.	aging	1983-07-??	Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by means of transcutaneous Doppler techniques in the aorta, right arm, and right leg of 480 normal subjects of both sexes in urban Beijing, China (age range 3 to 89 years, mean age 41 +/- 20.8 SD); supine blood pressure was recorded in the brachial artery of each subject with standard sphygmomanometric procedures. Serum cholesterol was determined in a subgroup of 79 subjects (age 17 to 85 years, mean 47 +/- 26 SD). PWV (y in cm/sec) was found to vary with age (x, years) at each of the three locations according to the following regression equations: aorta, y = 9.2x + 615, r = .673 (p less than .001); right arm, y = 4.8x + 998, r = .453 (p less than .001); right leg, y = 5.6x + 791, r = .630 (p less than .001). Systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures were found to increase with age. PWV also increased with mean supine blood pressure but was not related to serum cholesterol (average 4.49 +/- 0.11 [SEM], mmol/l). Compared with that of Western p…
20410235	Frailty, serum androgens, and the CAG repeat polymorphism: results from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study.	aging	2010-06-??	CONTEXT: The CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor, denoted (CAG)n, is thought to (inversely) index androgen sensitivity. We hypothesized that (CAG)n would exhibit a modifying influence on the association between circulating total and calculated free testosterone (TT and FT) and physical frailty in aging men.    OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to establish the influence of (CAG)n on the relation between circulating TT, FT, LH, SHBG, and frailty.    DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of health and endocrine functioning in randomly selected men, with a baseline (T1: 1987-89) and two follow-up (T2: 1995-1997; T3: 2002-2004) visits.    SETTING: This was an observational study of men residing in greater Boston, MA.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 624 subjects aged 50-86 yr were retained.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frailty phenotype was measured at T3. Components included weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, weakness, and slowness. Subjects exhibiting …
17825805	Associations of adiponectin with sex hormone-binding globulin levels in aging male and female populations.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Changes with aging in serum gonadal hormones, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and adiponectin, which are involved in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, are different in men and women. We examined the relationships of serum adiponectin concentrations with serum concentrations of hormones and SHBG in men and women.    METHODS: One hundred fifty-four men and 180 women aged from 50 to 85 years were included in the cross-sectional study. Serum concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, SHBG and adiponectin were measured in men and women.    RESULTS: Serum adiponectin concentration showed a significant positive correlation with serum SHBG concentration in men and women (r=0.404, p<0.0001 and r=0.348, p<0.0001, respectively). Multiple regression analysis also showed that SHBG was the significant predictor for adiponectin in men and women. Serum adiponectin concentration in men showed a significant positive correlation with total testoste…
11772524	Modulation of human lymphocyte proliferative response with aging.	aging	????-??-??	Previously, we have demonstrated age-associated alterations in transmembrane signaling. One of the most reproducible alterations found in the immune response with aging is the decrease of lymphocyte proliferation on stimulation with various different mitogens. Here, we confirm that proliferative responses to stimulation with phytohaemagglutin (PHA), recombinant human IL-2, or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody are all greater in the young (20-25 years) than old (60-87 years) population. We attempted to modulate the proliferative response using various agents acting at different levels of transmembrane signaling (pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, isoproterenol, PMA, Ca ionophore A23187), as well as at the level of the lymphocyte plasma membrane (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, MBCD), or by using antioxidant vitamins (Vitamin E or C). None of these agents was able to restore effectively the proliferative response of lymphocytes from the aged to the level of young subjects. Even the combination of A231…
3129819	Platelets and aging. I--Aggregation, arachidonate metabolism and antioxidant status.	aging	1988-02-01	Platelet functions were investigated in sixteen old (78-94 years) and eight young (25-35 years) subjects. Whole blood platelet aggregation induced by collagen was higher in the elderly. Similarly, aggregation of platelet rich plasma and plasma-free platelets induced by various agents was increased but the collagen-induced release of ATP was reduced. In agreement with the enhanced platelet aggregability, the increase of thromboxane formation (under thrombin stimulation) was also noted in platelets from elderly people. To further assess platelet and vascular function in vivo, we measured the excretion of urinary TXB2, 2,3-dinor TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The four metabolites were all increased in the elder population. In addition, a significant reduction of platelet vitamin E was observed in the elderly people, although the plasma content was normal. These results indicate numerous modifications of platelet behaviour with aging. They include the increased pl…
7462421	Differential changes in bone mineral density of the appendicular and axial skeleton with aging: relationship to spinal osteoporosis.	aging	1981-02-??	Patterns of bone loss in the axial and the appendicular skeleton were studied in 185 normal volunteers (105 women and 82 men; age range, 20--89 yr) and in 76 women and 9 men with vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis. Bone mineral density was measured in vivo at the lumbar spine (predominantly trabecular bone) by dual photon absorptiometry and at the midradius (greater than 95% cortical bone) and distal radius (75% cortical and 25% trabecular bone) by single photon absorptiometry. In normal women, bone diminution from the vertebrae began in young adulthood and was linear. In the appendicular skeleton, bone diminution did not occur until age 50 yr, was accelerated from aged 51 to 65 yr, and then decelerated somewhat after age 65 yr. Overall bone diminution throughout life was 47% for the vertebrae, 30% for the midradius, and 39% for the distal radius. In normal men, vertebral and appendicular bone diminution with aging was minimal or insignificant. Mean bone mineral density was lower …
7641900	Effects of aging on menstrual cycle hormones and endometrial maturation.	aging	1995-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in menstrual cycle hormones and endometrial maturation that may contribute to the decline in fertility with aging.    DESIGN: Prospective controlled clinical study.    SETTING: Normal human volunteers in an academic research institution.    SUBJECTS: Women with regular menstrual cycles.    INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-two women, aged 20 to 30 or 40 to 50 years, had daily blood drawing starting on cycle day 6 to 10 and continuing until 2 days after the onset of next menses. In addition, 60 women, aged 20 to 30 or 40 to 50 years, had a total of 93 endometrial biopsies performed on day 7 to 9 after the LH surge.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum LH, FSH, E2, inhibin, P, and placental protein 14 (PP14) levels and histologic maturation of the endometrium.    RESULTS: Serum FSH levels were increased whereas inhibin concentrations were reduced in the luteal-follicular transition of women > 40 years. No other hormonal changes were seen in this population, including P a…
15126119	Cell type- and brain structure-specific patterns of distribution of minibrain kinase in human brain.	aging	2004-06-04	The minibrain kinase (Mnb/Dyrk1A) gene is localized in the Down syndrome (DS) critical region of chromosome 21. This gene encodes a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase (minibrain kinase-Mnb/Dyrk1A), which is required for the proliferation of distinct neuronal cell types during postembryonic neurogenesis. To study the distribution of Mnb/Dyrk1A during human brain development and aging, we raised Mnb/Dyrk1A-specific antibody (mAb 7F3) and examined 22 brains of normal subjects from 8 months to 90 years of age. We found that neurons were the only cells showing the presence of 7F3-positive product in both cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear localization supports the concept that Mnb/Dyrk1A may be involved in control of gene expression. Synaptic localization of Mnb/Dyrk1A also supports our previous studies suggesting that Mnb/Dyrk1A is a regulator of assembly of endocytic apparatus and appears to be involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and synaptic signal transmission. Accumul…
6231715	Autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction in man. IX. Autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction and lymphocyte subsets in aging humans.	aging	1984-03-??	Peripheral blood from 15 young (20-30 years) and 15 aging (65-80 years) subjects was analysed for the proliferative response of T cells upon stimulation with non-T cells in the autologous mixed culture reaction (AMLR) and allogeneic MLR, and for the proportion of monoclonal antibody-defined lymphocyte subsets and monocytes. No significant difference was observed in the AMLR or allogeneic MLR between T and non-T cells in aging and young subjects. However, when non-T cells were further fractionated into adherent monocytes and non-adherent B cells (B cells and null cells), the AMLR between macrophages and T cells was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in young subjects than in simultaneously studied aging subjects. In contrast, the AMLR between T cells and B cells was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in the aging subjects than in the young group. In the T-T AMLR (using phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated T cells as stimulators), aging subjects had a significantly (P less than 0.05)…
7366252	Correlations between membrane viscosity, serum cholesterol, lymphocyte activation and aging in man.	aging	1980-02-??	Membrane microviscosity, serum cholesterol and lymphocyte stimulation in man were examined in relation to aging. A direct correlation was found between the mole ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids in the serum and the membrane microviscosity of the peripheral blood lymphocyte membranes, both of which increase progressively with age. The increase in membrane microviscosity with age is also concomitant with the decrease in response of the lymphocytes to concanavalin A stimulation. The data suggest that increase in lymphocyte membrane microviscosity is a prominent factor which may lead to the overt reduction of proliferative responses of lymphocytes with aging.
25880545	Unmet needs in long-term care and their associated factors among the oldest old in China.	longevity, aging	2015-04-12	BACKGROUND: With a rapidly aging population and a decline in the availability of family caregivers, the number of elders in China who have unmet long-term care needs is increasing. Because unmet needs often have negative consequences, it is increasingly important to identify factors associated with unmet needs. Utilizing Andersen's behavioral model of health services use, this study examines the roles of predisposing factors (demographics), enabling factors (resources), and need (e.g., illness level) in long-term care among the oldest old in China.    METHODS: Data from three waves (2005, 2008, and 2011) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) were analyzed. Four sequential, logistic regression models were designed to investigate how predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need were associated with unmet needs in long-term care.    RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses reveal that the significant factors for both rural and urban residents were economic status, …
27495935	Social Modulation or Hormonal Causation? Linkages of Testosterone with Sexual Activity and Relationship Quality in a Nationally Representative Longitudinal Sample of Older Adults.	aging	2016-??-??	This study used population-representative longitudinal data from the 2005-2006 and 2010-2011 waves of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project-a probability sample of US adults aged 57-85 at baseline (N = 650 women and 620 men)-to examine the causal direction in linkages of endogenous testosterone (T) with sexual activity and relationship quality. For both genders, our autoregressive effects indicated a large amount of temporal stability, not just in individual-level attributes (T, masturbation) but also dyadic ones (partnered sex, relationship quality)-indicating that a need for more nuanced theories of relational processes. Cross-lagged results suggested gender-specific effects-generally more consistent with sexual or relational modulation of T than with hormonal causation. Specifically, men's findings indicated their T might be elevated by their sexual (masturbatory) activity but not vice versa, although androgen levels did lower men's subsequent relationship quality. Wome…
19009367	Identification of Hsc70 as target for AGE modification in senescent human fibroblasts.	aging	2009-06-??	Cellular senescence is known as a potent mechanism of tumor suppression, and cellular senescence in vitro also reflects at least some features of aging in vivo. The Free Radical Theory of aging suggests that reactive oxygen species are important causative agents of aging and cellular senescence. Besides damage of nucleic acids and lipids, also oxidative modifications of proteins have been described as potential causative events in the senescence response. However, the identity of protein targets for post-translational modifications in senescent cells has remained unclear. In the present communication, we analyzed the occurrence of oxidative posttranslational modifications in senescent human endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts. We found a significant increase in the level of protein carbonyls and AGE modification with senescence in both cell types. Using 2D-Gel electrophoresis and Western Blot we found that heat shock cognate protein 70 is a bona fide target for AGE modification in…
17130386	Low micronutrient levels as a predictor of incident disability in older women.	aging	2006-11-27	BACKGROUND: The role of nutritional status in the disablement process is still unclear. The objective of this study was to assess whether low concentrations of nutrients predict the development and course of disability.    METHODS: Longitudinal study including community-dwelling women 65 years or older enrolled in the Women's Health and Aging Study I. In total, 643 women were assessed prospectively at 6-month intervals from 1992 to 1995.    RESULTS: Incidence rates of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs) during 3 years of follow-up. Incidence rates in the lowest quartile of each selected nutrient were compared with those in the upper quartiles. The hazard ratios were estimated from Cox models adjusted for potential confounders. Women in the lowest quartile of serum concentrations of vitamin B(6) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.67), vitamin B(12) (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.74), and selenium (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.71) had significantly higher r…
9512411	Cellular senescence: lessons from yeast for human aging?	aging	1998-03-12	Recent results point to an important role for the nucleolus in the senescence of yeast cells. A further report suggests that the formation and preferential accumulation in mother cells of extrachromosomal rDNA circles is a cause of aging in yeast; this may be an ancient and conserved mechanism of senescence.
22130324	A characterization of the relationship of ovarian reserve markers with age.	aging	2012-01-??	OBJECTIVE: To identify markers of ovarian age that best match the pattern of oocyte loss seen in histology specimens.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.    SETTING: University.    PATIENT(S): Caucasian women (n = 252) aged 25-45 years.    INTERVENTION(S): none.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The relationship between antral follicle count (AFC), antimüllerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, and E(2) with age was estimated using the power model, which previously has been shown to most accurately describe oocyte loss in histologic specimens. The power model was fit to each marker and used to compare the rates of change at ages 30 and 40 with the histologic pattern. Among those markers following the pattern, R(2) was used to compare the degree of relationship with age.    RESULT(S): Both AMH levels and AFC exhibited significant progressive declines with age. The average rates of loss per year for AFC and AMH were, respectively, -0.57 and -1.09 at age 30, and -1.33 and -3.06 at age 40. FSH, inhi…
28572574	Survive or thrive: tradeoff strategy for cellular senescence.	aging	2017-??-02	Aging-dependent cellular behaviors toward extrinsic stress are characterized by the confined localization of certain molecules to either nuclear or perinuclear regions. Although most growth factors can activate downstream signaling in aging cells, they do not in fact have any impact on the cells because the signals cannot reach their genetic targets in the nucleus. For the same reason, varying apoptotic stress factors cannot stimulate the apoptotic pathway in senescent cells. Thus, the operation of a functional nuclear barrier in an aging-dependent manner has been investigated. To elucidate the mechanism for this process, the housekeeping transcription factor Sp1 was identified as a general regulator of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (NCT) genes, including various nucleoporins, importins, exportins and Ran GTPase cycle-related genes. Interestingly, the posttranslational modification of Sp1 is readily influenced by extrinsic stress, including oxidative and metabolic stress. The decrease …
9418184	Altered expression and function of P-glycoprotein (170 kDa), encoded by the MDR 1 gene, in T cell subsets from aging humans.	aging	1997-11-??	Aging is associated with progressive T cell-mediated immune deficiency, increased frequency of infections, and autoimmune phenomena. P-glycoprotein (P-gP), a 170-kDa glycoprotein, is a member of a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transport proteins that has been shown to express on cells of the immune system and suggested to play a role in secretion of certain cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. Because aging is associated with altered secretion of cytokines, in this investigation we examined the expression and function of P-gP in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their "memory" and "naïve" subpopulations in peripheral blood from healthy aging and young subjects. P-glycoprotein expression was analyzed at the protein levels by dual- or triple-color flow cytometric analysis, using monoclonal antibodies against P-gP (MRK16), and at the mRNA level by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The efflux function of P-gP was measured by intracellular accumulation of rhodamine-1…
6252748	Effect of physical training on skeletal muscle metabolism and ultrastructure in 70 to 75-year-old men.	aging	1980-06-??	The effects of a 12-week program of physical training on skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) characteristics in 5 old men were investigated. Heart rates during submaximal bicycle exercise were decreased after training, indicating an improved cardiovascular function. As judged from enzyme activity measurements, the anaerobic capacity as well as the mitochondrial oxidative capacity were increased by the training. Fatty acid oxidation capacity remained unchanged, while the glycolytic potential tended to be increased, suggesting a somwehat different pattern of adaptation as compared to that seen in young subjects. Volume fractions of mitochondria and lipid droplets were unchanged with training, supporting the view that in old men, increases in oxidative capacity take place within the existing mitochondrial volume. It was concluded, that the aging human skeletal muscle remains trainable, and that the training response is similar, but possibly not identical, to that seen in younger age groups…
17513740	Altered innate immune functioning of dendritic cells in elderly humans: a role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-signaling pathway.	aging	2007-06-01	Aging represents a state of paradox where chronic inflammation is associated with declining immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the major APCs responsible for initiating an immune response. However, DC functions in aging have not been studied in detail. In this study, we have compared the innate immune functions of monocyte-derived myeloid DCs from elderly subjects with DCs from young individuals. We show that although phenotypically comparable, DCs from the aging are functionally different from DCs from the young. In contrast to DCs from the young, DCs from elderly individuals display 1) significantly reduced capacity to phagocytose Ags via macropinocytosis and endocytosis as determined by flow cytometry; 2) impaired capacity to migrate in vitro in response to the chemokines MIP-3beta and stromal cell-derived factor-1; and 3) significantly increased LPS and ssRNA-induced secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6, as determined by ELISA. Investigations of intracellular signaling revealed…
11552683	(Q) SAR study on the metabolic stability of steroidal androgens.	aging	2001-??-??	Metabolic stability is a key issue in the development of orally active androgens for Partial Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (PADAM) and male contraception. Rates of metabolism in human hepatocyte suspensions provide useful information on the stability of compounds that undergo a first pass metabolism. We have derived a structure-pharmacokinetic relationship for a data set of 32 in-house steroidal androgens by means of the decision-trees technique. Volume, shape, number of rotatable bonds, and surface turned out to be the most important descriptors for classification. Only 2 of the 32 compounds were misclassified. The most stable compounds were classified in three leaf nodes on different branches of the tree, suggesting that higher metabolic stability can be achieved for the same substrate by different steric modifications. Further, it is generally assumed that the first step in cytochrome P450s oxidation reactions takes place by hydrogen abstraction to form a radical intermediate. …
27102155	Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors.	aging	2016-06-28	Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed…
10850411	Telomere erosion varies during in vitro aging of normal human fibroblasts from young and adult donors.	aging	2000-06-01	The life span of normal fibroblasts in vitro (Hayflick limit) depends on donor age, and telomere shortening has been proposed as a potential mechanism. By quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, we show progressive telomere loss to about 5 kb mean telomere restriction fragment length in fibroblasts from two adult donors within 40 population doublings, whereas in fibroblasts from two infant donors, telomere erosion is reduced, leaving a mean telomere restriction fragment length of approximately 7 kb at senescence (after approximately 60 population doublings). Aging of fibroblasts from both infant and adult donors was not accompanied by chromosomal abnormalities but was correlated with increased telomere repeat-binding factor 2 expression at both the protein and transcriptional level.
29070789	The electrophysiological connectome is maintained in healthy elders: a power envelope correlation MEG study.	aging	2017-??-25	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report age-related changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), suggesting altered or reorganized connectivity patterns with age. However, age-related changes in neurovascular coupling might also partially account for altered connectivity patterns. Here, we used resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a connectome approach in carefully selected healthy young adults and elders. The MEG connectome was estimated as rsFC matrices involving forty nodes from six major  resting-state networks. Source-level rsFC maps were computed in relevant frequency bands using leakage-corrected envelope correlations. Group differences were statistically assessed using non-parametric permutation tests. Our results failed to evidence significant age-related differences after correction for multiple comparisons in the α and the β bands both for static and dynamic rsFC, suggesting that the electrophysiological connectome is maintained in h…
20309569	Smoking and AMH levels in women with normal reproductive history.	aging	2010-08-??	PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of age and smoking on the AMH levels in normal cycling healthy women with normal reproductive history.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 137 women, blood samples were taken on day 3 of a spontaneous cycle. Serum FSH, LH, E2, progesterone and AMH were measured in all blood samples. For the statistical analysis of the data, t test, Pearson's correlation and linear regression analysis were performed.    RESULTS: Of 137 women (43%), 59 were smokers. Age was positively correlated with serum FSH and LH levels (r = 0.584, P < 0.001 and r = 0.330, P < 0.001, respectively) and negatively correlated with serum AMH levels (r = -0.882, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in FSH, LH, E2, progesterone and AMH levels between smokers and non-smokers. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis showed that in both smokers and non-smokers, age was the most significant determinant of AMH levels (r = -0.889, P < 0.001 and r = -0.944, P < 0.001, respectively), w…
27337552	An Old Mom Keeps You Young: Mother's Age at Last Birth and Offspring Longevity in Nineteenth-Century Utah.	longevity, aging	2016-??-??	This study analyzes the intergenerational effects of late childbearing on offspring's adult longevity in a population in Utah (United States) that does not display evidence of parity-specific birth control-a so-called natural fertility population. Studies have found that for women who experience late menopause and prolonged reproduction, aging is postponed and longevity is increased. This is believed to indicate female "robustness" and the impact of biological or genetic factors. If indeed there is a genetic component involved, one would expect to also find evidence for the intergenerational transmission of longevity benefits. Our study investigates the relationship between prolonged natural fertility of mothers and their offspring's survival rates in adulthood. Gompertz regression models (N = 7,716) revealed that the offspring of mothers who were naturally fertile until a relatively advanced age lived significantly longer. This observed positive effect of late reproduction was not ind…
7176709	Increased lability of triosephosphate isomerase in progeria and Werner's syndrome fibroblasts.	aging	1982-10-??	Triosephosphate isomerase was found to have an increased thermolabile component in skin fibroblasts from patients with progeria and Werner's syndrome when compared with normal fibroblasts. Mixtures of cell extracts from progeria or Werner's syndrome with normal fibroblasts gave intermediate levels of the heat-labile triosephosphate isomerase suggesting the absence of cytosolic destabilizing factors. The incorporation of the protease inhibitors 1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin A in cell extracts failed to affect the level of the labile form of triosephosphate isomerase. The labile component also accumulates in normal fibroblasts in late passage in tissue culture and appears to be identical to the deamidated form of the enzyme which accumulates in other aging cells.
6384252	Insulin-like growth factors I and II: aging and bone density in women.	aging	1984-10-??	Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) were measured by RIA in 57 normal women, ages 30 - 90 yr, and in 29 untreated women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures, ages 55 - 75 yr. These values were correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal and midradius assessed by single photon absorptiometry and of the lumbar spine assessed by dual photon absorptiometry as well as serum and urinary calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, immunoreactive PTH, urinary hydroxyproline, and creatinine clearance. Serum IGF-I levels declined markedly with age (r = -0.47, P less than 0.001). Serum IGF-II levels decreased only slightly with age, and this decrease was not statistically significant. Although BMD at all three scanning sites also declined significantly with age, neither serum IGF-I nor II concentrations correlated with BMD when age was held constant. In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serum IGF-I and II did not …
20350184	Overrecruitment in the aging brain as a function of task demands: evidence for a compensatory view.	aging	2011-04-??	This study used fMRI to investigate the neural effects of increasing cognitive demands in normal aging and their role for performance. Simple and complex go/no-go tasks were used with two versus eight colored letters as go stimuli, respectively. In both tasks, no-go stimuli could produce high conflict (same letter, different color) or low conflict (colored numbers) with go stimuli. Multivariate partial least square analysis of fMRI data showed that older adults overengaged a cohesive pattern of fronto-parietal regions with no-go stimuli under the specific combination of factors which progressively amplified task demands: high conflict no-go trials in the first phase of the complex task. This early neural overrecruitment was positively correlated with a lower error rate in the older group. Thus, the present data suggest that age-related extra-recruitment of neural resources can be beneficial for performance under taxing task conditions, such as when novel, weak, and complex rules have t…
10328972	Fas-activated apoptosis and apoptosis mediators in human trabecular meshwork cells.	aging	1999-05-??	A gradual loss of cells occurs within the human trabecular meshwork during normal aging and appears to be increased in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The exact mechanism by which cells are lost in either condition is not known, however phagocytosis, cell migration and cell death have been suggested. Apoptosis is one method by which cell death can occur. We have examined the modulators for apoptosis within the human trabecular meshwork using both cell lines and ex-vivo dissected trabecular meshwork tissues obtained from normal donors. Using RT-PCR it was shown that mRNA for several modulators of apoptosis (Fas, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, and ICE) are expressed by both cell lines and ex-vivo tissues. Apoptosis was stimulated to occur by treating cell lines with a monoclonal antibody (IgM) to Fas. Apoptosis was verified via morphological changes to the cells, transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling TUNEL Immunofluorescence, and DNA laddering. Control cells exposed to IgM did not …
7484885	Endothelium-derived relaxing factors and converting enzyme inhibition.	lifespan, aging	1995-11-24	Endothelial cells can produce at least 3 substances which cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle: (1) endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO, which is secreted not only toward the underlying vascular smooth muscle but also into the blood vessel lumen). NO also has a physiological role at the interface between the endothelial cells and the blood content; in particular, NO inhibits the adhesion of platelets and leukocytes to the endothelium. (2) Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, presumably a labile metabolite of arachidonic acid formed through the P-450 pathway, which appears to act on smooth muscle by being one of the few physiologic openers of the potassium channels. (3) Prostacyclin, which can be considered as an endothelium-derived relaxing substance, given its vasodilator activity and its primarily endothelial origin. One of the main factors modulating the release of these EDRFs is the shear stress of blood on the arterial wall, which explains why flow-induced vasodilati…
28952849	Gait Coordination Deteriorates in Independent Old-Old Adults.	aging	2018-??-01	Human gait is symmetric and bilaterally coordinated in young healthy persons. In this study, we aimed to explore the differences in bilateral coordination of gait as measured by the phase coordination index (PCI), gait asymmetry, and stride time variability of gait between four age groups. A total of 44 older adults were recruited: nine young-old (age 70-74 years), 26 old (age 75-84 years), nine old-old (>85 years and older), and 13 young adults (age 20-30 years). Subjects walked on a treadmill; walking speed was systematically increased from 0.5 to 0.9 m/s in steps of 0.1 m/s. There were marginal effects of age on PCI, significant main effects of walking speeds without interaction between walking speeds and age group. A difference in PCI could distinguish between young's and late aging group, and only during their preferred treadmills walking speed. This study explicitly shows that bilateral coordination of walking is modified by gait speed, and deteriorates only at a very old age.
26089239	Human longevity is characterised by high thyroid stimulating hormone secretion without altered energy metabolism.	longevity	2015-06-19	Few studies have included subjects with the propensity to reach old age in good health, with the aim to disentangle mechanisms contributing to staying healthier for longer. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis maintains circulating levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) in an inverse relationship. Greater longevity has been associated with higher TSH and lower TH levels, but mechanisms underlying TSH/TH differences and longevity remain unknown. The HPT axis plays a pivotal role in growth, development and energy metabolism. We report that offspring of nonagenarians with at least one nonagenarian sibling have increased TSH secretion but similar bioactivity of TSH and similar TH levels compared to controls. Healthy offspring and spousal controls had similar resting metabolic rate and core body temperature. We propose that pleiotropic effects of the HPT axis may favour longevity without altering energy metabolism.
8041811	UVA-induced autocrine stimulation of fibroblast-derived collagenase/MMP-1 by interrelated loops of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6.	aging	1994-05-??	Previous work has shown that fibroblast-derived collagenase/matrix-metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), responsible for the breakdown of dermal interstitial collagen, was dose-dependently induced in vitro and in vivo by UVA irradiation and this induction was at least partly mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6). We here provide evidence that UVA-induced IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta play a central role in the induction of the synthesis both of IL-6 and collagenase/MMP-1. In contrast to the late increase of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA levels at 6 h postirradiation, bioactivity of IL-1 is already detectable at 1 h postirradiation. This early peak of IL-1 bioactivity appears to be responsible for the induction of IL-6 synthesis and together with IL-6 lead to an increase of the steady-state mRNA level of collagenase/MMP-1 as deduced from studies using IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta antisense oligonucleotides or neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Besides the early posttranslationally contr…
12663275	Cognitive decline and fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes--The EVA Study.	aging	2003-04-??	BACKGROUND: Dietary factors might modify cognitive decline that results from aging. Fatty acids, which are limiting factors in brain development, are prime candidates.    OBJECTIVE: We studied the relation between erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition and cognitive decline in free-living volunteers.    DESIGN: In 1995, erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition was measured in 246 men and women (aged 63-74 y) from the Etude du Vieillissement Artériel (EVA) cohort. During a 4-y follow-up, cognitive abilities were assessed longitudinally with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Moderate cognitive decline was defined as a > or = 2-point decrease over the 4 y. The predictive value of fatty acid proportions on cognitive decline was assessed with a multivariate logistic model that included age, sex, education level, and initial Mini-Mental State Examination score as covariates.    RESULTS: Higher proportions of both stearic acid (saturated, 18:0) and total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty aci…
23086222	Age-related changes in parietal lobe activation during an episodic memory retrieval task.	aging	2013-05-??	The crucial role of lateral parietal regions in episodic memory has been confirmed in previous studies. While aging has an influence on retrieval of episodic memory, it remains to be examined how the involvement of lateral parietal regions in episodic memory changes with age. We investigated episodic memory retrieval in two age groups, using faces as stimuli and retrieval success as a measure of episodic memory. Young and elderly participants showed activation within a similar network, including lateral and medial parietal as well as prefrontal regions, but elderly showed a higher level of brain activation regardless of condition. Furthermore, we examined functional connectivity in the two age groups and found a more extensive network in the young group, including correlations of parietal and prefrontal regions. In the elderly, the overall stronger activation related to memory performance may indicate a compensatory process for a less extensive functional network.
20134207	The CXCL12/CXCR4 pair in aged human thymus.	aging	2010-??-??	CXCL12 is an important CXC chemokine involved in numerous biological processes. We had previously demonstrated the synergistic participation of CXCL12 and IL-7 in the control of both survival and proliferation of CD34(+) human thymic lymphoid progenitors. On this basis, we hypothesize a presumptive role for CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, in the thymus involution. In this respect, in the current report we describe the expression of both molecules in the human thymus during aging. Our results demonstrate that, despite the profound alterations observed in the thymic epithelial microenvironment of aged thymuses, the proportions of different CD4/CD8 thymocyte subsets do not undergo significant variations. Remarkably, a strong CXCL12 expression was found in older thymuses, which appeared in the same locations as in younger thymuses: the subcapsulary and medullary areas. The proportions of CXCR4(+) cells, most of them belonging to the CD3(-) compartment, showed no important variations in the…
25612932	Forensic determination of blood sample age using a bioaffinity-based assay.	aging	2015-03-07	A bioaffinity-driven cascade assay was developed to determine the time elapsed from the point a blood sample was left at a crime scene to the point of discovery. Two blood markers, creatine kinase (CK) and alanine transaminase (ALT), were utilized to determine the age of the blood spot based on their natural denaturation processes. The analysis with the proposed bioassay was performed in human serum samples, which underwent the aging process under environmental conditions that could be expected at crime scenes. The concentration of the markers in the sample was based on physiological levels present in healthy adults. These two markers were concerted in a biocatalytic cascade composed of two parallel subsystems, with each of them following the activity of one marker. Both markers have very distinct denaturation rates which would not allow them to be used in a single marker setup while still providing satisfactory results. However, by parallel tunable monitoring of both markers, it is po…
23631897	Partial removal of pore and loosely bound water by low-energy drying decreases cortical bone toughness in young and old donors.	aging	2013-06-??	With an ability to quantify matrix-bound and pore water in bone, (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry can potentially be implemented in clinical imaging to assess the fracture resistance of bone in a way that is independent of current X-ray techniques, which assess bone mineral density as a correlate of bone strength. Working towards that goal, we quantified the effect of partial dehydration in air on the mechanical and NMR properties of human cortical bone in order to understand whether NMR is sensitive to water-bone interactions at low energy and whether such interactions contribute to the age-related difference in the toughness of bone. Cadaveric femurs were collected from male and female donors falling into two age groups: 21-60 years of age (young) and 74-99 years of age (old). After extracting two samples from the medial cortex of the mid-shaft, tensile tests were conducted on Wet specimens and paired, Partially Dry (PtlD) specimens (prepared by low-energy drying in …
2579088	Somatomedin C-binding and action in fibroblasts from aged and progeric subjects.	aging	1985-04-??	Aging is associated with diminished cell growth, which has been ascribed in part to decreased cellular responsiveness to serum mitogens. To investigate whether there is an age-related loss of responsiveness to somatomedin-C (SM-C), we studied SM-C binding and action in early passage fibroblasts from normal donors, aged 7-96 yr, and one progeric subject. SM-C stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation 4- to 16-fold in young cells, 4- to 17-fold in aged cells, and 4- to 11-fold in progeric cells. SM-C was synergistic with 0.25% human hypopituitary serum in stimulating [3H]thymidine incorporation in all cell lines. Dose-response curves for SM-C stimulation of thymidine incorporation were not significantly altered in aged or progeric cells. Half-maximal responses occurred at 5-15 ng/ml SM-C for all cell lines. [3H]Thymidine incorporation results were supported by cell replication studies. In addition, binding of [125I] SM-C was virtually identical in all cell lines, with 50% displacement at 2-…
18799683	Growth of white matter in the adolescent brain: role of testosterone and androgen receptor.	aging	2008-09-17	The growth of white matter during human adolescence shows a striking sexual dimorphism; the volume of white matter increases with age slightly in girls and steeply in boys. Here, we provide evidence supporting the role of androgen receptor (AR) in mediating the effect of testosterone on white matter. In a large sample of typically developing adolescents (n = 408, 204 males), we used magnetic resonance imaging and acquired T1-weighted and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) images. We also measured plasma levels of testosterone and genotyped a functional polymorphism in the AR gene, namely the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 believed to be inversely proportional to the AR transcriptional activity. We found that the testosterone-related increase of white-matter volume was stronger in male adolescents with the lower versus higher number of CAG repeats in the AR gene, with testosterone explaining, respectively, 26 and 8% of variance in the volume. The MTR results suggest that this growth is…
6270181	Effect of age on serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and its biological effects.	aging	1981-11-??	Immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, nephrogenous cAMP (ncAMP), and tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption (TmP) were measured in 10 young and 12 healthy volunteers. The fasting urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (Ca:Cr) was also quantitated as an index of bone resorption. Aging was attended by increased iPTH levels (6.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.4 mu leq/ml; P less than 0.01) as well as increased ncAMP levels (2.48 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.21 nmol/100 ml glomerular filtrate; P less than 0.005) and decreased TmP (2.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 mg/100 ml glomerular filtrate; P less than 0.005), indicating that the increased iPTH levels reflected the biological effects of the hormone. A significant positive correlation of iPTH and ncAMP and a significant negative correlation of iPTH and TmP were observed. The Ca:Cr was increased in the older volunteers (0.10 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.01; P less than 0.05). The elderly subjects had significantly decreased daily calcium ingestion, seru…
12414864	Longitudinal assessment of serum free testosterone concentration predicts memory performance and cognitive status in elderly men.	aging	2002-11-??	Circulating testosterone (T) levels have behavioral and neurological effects in both human and nonhuman species. Both T concentrations and neuropsychological function decrease substantially with age in men. The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to investigate the relationships between age-associated decreases in endogenous serum T and free T concentrations and declines in neuropsychological performance. Participants were volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, aged 50-91 yr at baseline T assessment. Four hundred seven men were followed for an average of 10 yr, with assessments of multiple cognitive domains and contemporaneous determination of serum total T, SHBG, and a free T index (FTI). We administered neuropsychological tests of verbal and visual memory, mental status, visuomotor scanning and attention, verbal knowledge/language, visuospatial ability, and depressive symptomatology. Higher FTI was associated with better scores on visual and verbal…
34641	Role of the hypothalamus in the aging woman.	aging	1979-03-??	Relationships between the hypothalamus and the pituitary in the aging woman are discussed under the following subheadings: synthesis and release of follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, estrogen receptors, other releasing factors, neurotransmitters, and the mechanisms of hot flushes and migrainoid headaches. The hypothalamus is the main regulator of pituitary function. In the female the hypothalamic-pituitary axis appears to remain functionally intact well into old age.
22730514	Hormonal environment affects cognition independent of age during the menopause transition.	aging	2012-09-??	CONTEXT: Cognitive decline is prevalent in aging populations, and cognitive complaints are common during menopause. However, the extent of hormonal influence is unclear, particularly when considered independent of the aging process.    OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine differences in cognitive function attributable to menopause, hypothesizing that differences would be associated with reproductive rather than chronological age.    DESIGN AND SETTING: In this cross-sectional study at a university hospital, we combined neuropsychological measures with functional magnetic resonance imaging to comprehensively assess cognitive function.    PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven menopausal women, aged 42-61 yr, recruited from a population-based menopause study, grouped into menopause stages based on hormonal and cycle criteria (premenopause, perimenopause, and postmenopause), participated in the study.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of verba…
16046154	Anti-Mullerian hormone in premenopausal women and after spontaneous or surgically induced menopause.	aging	2005-10-??	OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in menopausal women, and (2) to confirm the source of AMH in cycling women and its disappearance after the removal of the source.    METHODS: An observational and prospective study was conducted.    RESULTS: A total of 47 women were recruited for the study. The study population consisted of the following groups of patients: (A) women of late reproductive age (n = 24; mean age +/- SD, 44 +/- 2.8 years); (B) menopausal women (n =14; mean age, 56 +/- 4 years); and (C) regularly cycling women undergoing surgical menopause (n = 9; mean age, 43 +/- 4 years). Blood samples were obtained from all patients. In patients undergoing surgery, blood samples were obtained before and after surgery. AMH was undetectable in 13 of 14 postmenopausal women, whereas it was undetectable in only two of 24 women of late reproductive age. A significant negative correlation has been found between AMH and age or fol…
6363303	Cholera toxin-binding T cells in the human peripheral blood at different ages.	aging	1984-??-??	The capacity of human T cells to bind cholera toxin was shown to decrease with age. In aged humans, the number of cells capable of binding high concentrations of cholera toxin was lower than that in young humans. The method presented in this paper may be useful as one of the indicators of aging of the immune system.
26205825	The impact of eye closure on somatosensory perception in the elderly.	aging	2015-10-15	Visual dominance over other senses is a well-known phenomenon. Closing the eyes, even in complete darkness, can improve somatosensory perception by switching off various aspects of visual dominance. How and if this mechanism is affected by aging remains unknown. We performed detailed neurophysiological and functional MR-imaging on healthy young and elderly participants under the conditions of opened and closed eyes. We found an improved perception threshold in both groups when the eyes were closed, but the improvement was significantly less pronounced in the elderly. fMRI data revealed increased resting activity in the somatosensory cortex with closed eyes, and the stimulus-induced activity of the secondary somatosensory cortex decreased in the young but not in the elderly. This study demonstrates that a switch towards unisensory processing via eye closure is preserved but significantly reduced in the aging brain. We suggest that the decreased ability for unisensory processing is a gen…
28745785	Analysis on the relationship and mechanism of high blood pressure and vascular aging on the condition that the gender and age matches.	aging	2017-07-??	OBJECTIVE: The relationship between hypertension and the mechanism of the expression of T-lymphocyte Kv1.3 channels in vascular aging has been analyzed in this study based on the gender and age matches' principle.    PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients have been consecutively chosen with vascular aging caused by hypertension (group A), while 30 cases of high blood pressure not merged with vascular aging (group B) were chosen, and 30 cases of healthy volunteers (group C), conforming to gender and age 1:1 and the closest matching principle, were studied. The aim of this study was to separate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and give intervention of 0.2 nmol/L ANGII to CD4 + T-lymphocytes, and store them in the incubator 48 h. The difference of Kv1.3 channel current of CD4 + T-lymphocyte, mRNA, angiotensin receptor (AT1R) protein mRNA, and IFN-γ density has also been compared.    RESULTS: The membrane capacitance, peak current, and current density of group A, are higher than those…
21436460	Cardiac function following prolonged exercise: influence of age.	aging	2011-06-??	This study sought to determine the influence of age on the left ventricular (LV) response to prolonged exercise (PE; 150 min). LV systolic and diastolic performance was assessed using echocardiography (ECHO) before (pre) and 60 min following (post) exercise performed at 80% maximal aerobic power in young (28 ± 4.5 years; n = 18; mean ± SD) and middle-aged (52 ± 3.9 years; n = 18) participants. LV performance was assessed using two-dimensional ECHO, including speckle-tracking imaging, to determine LV strain (LV S) and LV S rate (LV SR), in addition to Doppler measures of diastolic function. We observed a postexercise elevation in LV S (young: -19.5 ± 2.1% vs. -21.6 ± 2.1%; middle-aged: -19.9 ± 2.3% vs. -20.8 ± 2.1%; P < 0.05) and LV SR (young: -1.19 ± 0.1 vs. -1.37 ± 0.2; middle-aged: -1.20 ± 0.2 vs. -1.38 ± 0.2; P < 0.05) during recovery in both groups. Diastolic function was reduced during recovery, including the LV SR ratio of early-to-late atrial diastolic filling (SR(e/a)), in youn…
20421239	Senescence-related truncation and multimerization of apolipoprotein A-I in high-density lipoprotein with an elevated level of advanced glycated end products and cholesteryl ester transfer activity.	aging	2010-06-??	To compare the change in lipoprotein metabolism with aging, we analyzed the lipid and protein compositions of individual lipoprotein fractions. Healthy and nonobese elderly participants (elderly group, n = 26) had a serum lipid profile within the normal range, although slightly higher than in young participants (control group, n = 18). However, the elderly group had a twofold higher serum uric acid level and triglyceride (TG):high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. The elderly group had less antioxidant ability and elevated TG content in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) with enhanced cholesteryl ester transfer activity. An elevated level of advanced glycated end products in lipoproteins and fragmentation of apoA-I were present in the elderly group, with detected lower apoA-I level and more multimerized apoA-I in HDL. The protein levels of apoA-I, apoC-III, and serum amyloid A in lipoprotein-deficient serum were increased in the elderly group.
16243606	Subjective memory complaints in aging are associated with elevated cortisol levels.	aging	????-??-??	The origin and clinical significance of subjective memory complaints among middle aged and older individuals is not well understood. Associations with objective memory impairments, personality traits or mood disturbances have been reported. Elevated cortisol levels occur in aging and depression and causal links to cognitive or emotional problems have been suggested. The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between basal and feedback indices of cortisol regulation and subjective memory impairment in a sample of healthy middle aged and older subjects (mean age 61.8 years) with (n=27) and without (n=19) subjective memory complaints. Participants with memory complaints had both higher basal cortisol levels and higher cortisol levels after dexamethasone. There was a significant group by gender interaction for basal cortisol levels, where women without memory complaints showed significantly lower cortisol levels, whereas no such difference was found for the men. All effects…
16799135	A polymorphism of the YTHDF2 gene (1p35) located in an Alu-rich genomic domain is associated with human longevity.	longevity	2006-06-??	The uneven distribution of Alu repetitive elements in the human genome is related to specific functional properties of genomic regions. We report the identification of a locus associated with human longevity in one of the chromosomal regions with the highest density of Alu elements, in 1p35. The locus, corresponding to a (TG)n microsatellite in the YTHDF2 gene, was identified by characterizing an "anonymous" marker detectable through inter-Alu fingerprinting, which previously evidenced an increased homozygosity in centenarians. After genotyping 412 participants of different ages, including 137 centenarians, we confirmed the increased homozygosity in centenarians at this locus, and observed a concomitantly increased frequency of the most frequent allele and the corresponding homozygous genotype. Remarkably, the same genotype was associated with increased YTHDF2 messenger RNA levels in immortalized lymphocytes. Finally, YTHDF2 messenger RNA resulted to be mainly expressed in testis and p…
28506127	Living into death: a case for an iterative, fortified and cross-sector approach to advance care planning.	aging	2017-12-??	Advance care planning (ACP) has been framed as best practice for quality palliative care, yet a growing body of literature affirms the need for an early iterative ACP process to begin when people are young and healthy. A significant gap appears to exist in the literature regarding the utility of death conversations outside the end-of-life context. Could 'death conversations' early in life be an effective tool by which doctor and patient can co-construct a more healthful way of life, and realistic relationship with death? And what variables must be taken into account for these conversations to proceed successfully? This paper provides a narrative exploration of the value of death conversations in the clinical context in New Zealand. Five exemplars are discussed, drawn from a sample of 21 semi-structured interviews with young older adults (54-65 years old) not receiving palliative care or diagnosed with a terminal illness. Together, these narratives indicate that further community consul…
20338153	Structural approach to the aging of phosphylated cholinesterases.	aging	2010-09-06	Phosphylated cholinesterases (ChE) can undergo a side reaction that progressively decreases their reactivatability. This process, termed "aging", results from dealkylation of the adduct and depends on the structure of the organophosphyl moiety. Aged ChEs are resistant to reactivation by oximes. Owing to the toxicological importance of OPs, the molecular mechanism of aging has been the subject of research for decades. It was not clear whether aging involves the same bond breakage regardless the type of OP or is a scission of P-O-C bonds (P-O or O-C) in phosphates/phosphonates, P-N-C bonds in phosphoramidates, and P-S-C bonds in phosphonothionates. It was assumed that the resulting negatively charged atom on phosphorus of the aged adduct prevented nucleophilic attack by oximates, but studies on negatively charged model molecules do not support this hypothesis. Decrease in conformational flexibility of aged enzymes may contribute to their non-reactivatability by preventing proper adjustme…
21568952	Frailty in relation to variations in hormone levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in older men: results from the European male aging study.	aging	2011-05-??	OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between frailty and reproductive axis hormones (as an important regulatory system) in middle aged and older men.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional.    SETTING: The European Male Aging Study.    PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand two hundred nineteen community-dwelling European men aged 40 to 79.    MEASUREMENTS: Interviewer-assisted questionnaires to assess physical activity, health status, and mood were administered. Testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in a fasting morning blood sample. Frailty was assessed as an index (FI) according to the number (out of 43 possible) of health deficits (symptoms, signs, and functional impairments). Relationships between FI and hormone levels (as outcomes) were explored using regression models.    RESULTS: Mean FI was 0.12 ± 0.11 (range 0-0.67) was highest in the oldest group. After adjust…
27450266	Motor and mental training in older people: Transfer, interference, and associated functional neural responses.	aging	2016-??-??	Learning new motor skills may become more difficult with advanced age. In the present study, we randomized 56 older individuals, including 30 women (mean age 70.6 years), to 6 weeks of motor training, mental (motor imagery) training, or a combination of motor and mental training of a finger tapping sequence. Performance improvements and post-training functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to investigate performance gains and associated underlying neural processes. Motor-only training and a combination of motor and mental training improved performance in the trained task more than mental-only training. The fMRI data showed that motor training was associated with a representation in the premotor cortex and mental training with a representation in the secondary visual cortex. Combining motor and mental training resulted in both premotor and visual cortex representations. During fMRI scanning, reduced performance was observed in the combined motor and mental training group,…
26296653	The experiences of self-care in community-dwelling older people: a meta-synthesis.	aging	2015-12-??

REVIEW METHODS: Data from the selected qualitative articles were extracted independently by two reviewers using the data extraction tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The meta-synthesis involved the following three steps: …
17126971	Characteristics of the institutionalized and community-residing oldest-old in China.	longevity	2007-02-??	Existing research on the institutionalized population of older adults is primarily limited to Western countries. This study is the first to use nationally representative data to examine differences in the institutionalized and community-residing population of the oldest-old (ages 80+) in China. Using three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) (1998, 2000, and 2002), we examine differences in sociodemographic characteristics, family caregiving resources, health practices, religious activity, chronic conditions, and mortality risk. The results indicate that the institutionalized oldest-old are younger, male, reside in urban areas, have lower family-care resources, and exhibit poorer health compared to those living in the community. We also find that the 2-year mortality risk for institutionalized elders is 1.35 times greater than for those residing in the community. However, the mortality differential is eliminated once the sociodemographic, family caregivin…
19564661	Walking speed at self-selected exercise pace is lower but energy cost higher in older versus younger women.	aging	2009-05-??	BACKGROUND: Walking is usually undertaken at a speed that coincides with the lowest metabolic cost. Aging however, alters the speed-cost relationship, as preferred walking speeds decrease and energy costs increase. It is unclear to what extent this relationship is affected when older women undertake walking as an exercise modality. The aim of this study was to compare the energetic cost of walking at a self-selected exercise pace for a 30 minute period in older and younger women.    METHODS: The energetic cost of walking was assessed using the energy equivalent of oxygen consumption measured in 18 young (age 25 to 49 years) and 20 older (age 50 to 79 years) women who were asked to walk at their 'normal' exercise pace on a motorized treadmill for 30 minutes duration.    RESULTS: The mass-specific net cost of walking (Cw) was 15% higher and self-selected walking speed was 23% lower in the older women than in the younger group. When speed was held constant, the Cw was 0.30 (J.kg-1.m-1) hi…
10931745	Age-related serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I, -II and IGF-binding protein-3 following myocardial infarction.	aging	2000-04-??	Aging retards the repair process by decreasing hormone secretion from the somatotrophic axis, which plays a major role in tissue reconstruction after injury. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of aging on serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels following myocardial infarction (MI). For four consecutive days, we monitored the variation of serum IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 concentrations in 26 patients aged 19-71 years who were diagnosed with MI. Serum IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were measured daily by double antibody radioimmunoassay. Daily serum IGF-I concentrations showed a significant negative correlation with age (r = -0.528, P< 0.001). Total serum IGF-I was significantly (P = 0.002) higher in the younger age group (patients under 50 years) compared to the older group (50 years and over); 206 +/- 16 ng/ml vs 136 +/- 12 ng/ml. During this investigation, younger patients (under 50 years) showed no significant daily varia…
28950115	Conscientiousness, hair cortisol concentration, and health behaviour in older men and women.	longevity	2017-12-??	Conscientious is associated with greater longevity and other favourable health outcomes, but the processes underlying these links are poorly understood. Health behaviours such as physical activity and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption may contribute, but direct associations with neuroendocrine and inflammatory processes may also be relevant. We tested the associations between conscientiousness and hair cortisol concentration in 2318 older men and women (mean age 66.2 years) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Conscientiousness was positively associated with physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption, and negatively related to alcohol intake, sedentary behaviour, body mass index and depressive symptoms (all p<0.001). We found an inverse association between conscientiousness and hair cortisol concentration that was independent of age, sex, education and wealth (β=-0.053, p=0.012), and the relationship remained significant with additional adjustm…
24325248	Senescence-related genes possibly responsible for poor liver regeneration after hepatectomy in elderly patients.	aging	2014-05-??	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver regeneration likely decreases with age by an, as yet, incompletely understood mechanism, restricting the extent of hepatectomy. We therefore analyzed the effect of aging on liver regeneration and investigated mechanisms associate with poor regeneration of human liver.    METHODS: We assessed 130 patients who underwent hepatectomy at our institute between 2005 and 2012. The patients were divided into two groups, a younger (age < 65 years, n = 59) and an older (age > 65 years, n = 71) group. The expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), its ligand Met, and the senescence-related genes p16, SIRT1 and SMP30 were assessed by qRT-PCR. Simulated preoperative and 1 week and 6 month postoperative liver volumes were evaluated in 11 younger and 11 older patients using a 3D simulation imaging system. Regenerated liver volumes were calculated and compared with clinicopathological factors, and correlations between liver regeneration and gene expression were calculated. …
11282252	Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding potential declines with age as measured by [11C]WAY-100635 and PET.	aging	2001-05-??	Positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]WAY-100635 were used to examine the effect of age on serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor binding potential (BP) in 19 healthy subjects. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on the co-registered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in orbitofrontal (OFC), dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), lateral (LTC), and mediotemporal (MTC), parietal, occipital and cerebellar cortex, and the raphe nuclei. BP values were calculated using a simplified reference tissue method. In addition, a voxelwise analysis was performed using SPM99. Voxelwise analysis revealed a significant global decrease of 5-HT(1A) BP with age (set level <.001). ROI analysis revealed significant age-related 5-HT(1A) BP decreases in DLPFC (r = -0.56), ACC (r = -0.44), OFC (r = -0.42), LTC (r = -0.40), parietal (r = -0.65), and occipital cortex (r = -0.43), but not in MTC or raphe nuclei. Overall, cortical 5-HT(1A) BP declined by approximately 10% per decade, except for th…
22728314	The effect of caffeine on working memory load-related brain activation in middle-aged males.	aging	2013-01-??	Caffeine is commonly consumed in an effort to enhance cognitive performance. However, little is known about the usefulness of caffeine with regard to memory enhancement, with previous studies showing inconsistent effects on memory performance. We aimed to determine the effect of caffeine on working memory (WM) load-related activation during encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases of a WM maintenance task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 20 healthy, male, habitual caffeine consumers aged 40-61 years were administered 100 mg of caffeine in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Participants were scanned in a non-withdrawn state following a workday during which caffeinated products were consumed according to individual normal use (range = 145-595 mg). Acute caffeine administration was associated with increased load-related activation compared to placebo in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during WM encoding, but decreased load-related ac…
3522617	The dawn phenomenon does not occur in normal elderly subjects.	aging	1986-08-??	To determine whether the dawn phenomenon occurs in normal elderly subjects and thus contributes to the progressive mild fasting hyperglycemia of aging, we examined the effect of physiological insulin levels on glucose disposal and hepatic glucose production (HGO) between 0530 and 0800 h, and 0930 and 1200 h. Paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies (8 mU/m2 X min) were performed on healthy old subjects (n = 5), employing [3H]glucose methodology to measure glucose production and disposal rates. Basal plasma insulin, GH, glucagon, and cortisol levels, and HGO and glucose disposal rates were similar before each study. Steady state plasma insulin values were slightly, but not significantly, lower during the dawn study [dawn: 20.3 +/- 1.1 (SE); control: 23.5 +/- 2.1 microU/ml, P = 0.08]. Insulin clearance rates were higher during the dawn study (dawn: 523 +/- 16; control: 430 +/- 19 ml/m2 X min, P less than 0.01). Maximum glucose disposal rates (dawn: 3.10 +/- 0.24; control: 3.03 +/- 0.23 mg…
1707071	The effects of aging on the secretion of the common alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones in men.	aging	1991-04-??	To investigate the effects of aging on the secretion of the common alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones, we measured basal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T) and alpha-subunit in 176 normal men aged 19 to 89 years. In addition, in two groups of young (less than 65 years; n = 25) and old (greater than 65 years; n = 15) subjects, the effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) on LH and alpha-subunit secretion were determined. Age-related increases in serum alpha-subunit and LH were noted only in the oldest men while T levels decreased progressively with advancing age. LHRH stimulation resulted in significantly greater secretion of alpha-subunit in the old subjects while no difference in LH release between young and old men was observed. Moreover, there was a delay to peak LH and alpha-subunit levels after LHRH in the old subjects. These data suggest that the aging process in males involves deficits in both testicular and gonadotroph functions as demon…
16684818	Vitamin D status in relation to one-year risk of recurrent falling in older men and women.	aging	2006-08-??	BACKGROUND: Falls frequently occur in the elderly and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality.    OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to prospectively investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and risk of recurrent falling in older men and women.    DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study.    SETTING: An age- and sex-stratified random sample of the Dutch older population was determined.    SUBJECTS: Subjects included 1231 men and women (aged 65 yr and older) participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam.    MEASUREMENTS: Baseline serum 25(OH)D was determined by a competitive protein binding assay. During 1 yr, falls were prospectively recorded by means of a fall calendar.    RESULTS: Low 25(OH)D (<10 ng/ml) was associated with an increased risk of falling. After adjustment for age, sex, education level, region, season, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.78 (1.06-2…
3567563	Muscarinic and dopaminergic receptors in the aging human brain.	aging	1987-02-24	[3H]1-Quinuclidinyl(phenyl)-4-benzilate ([3H]QNB), [3H]spiroperidol and [3H]flupenthixol were used to label brain muscarinic, dopamine D2 and D1 receptors, respectively, in altogether 78 patients aged from 4 to 93 years. The binding of [3H]QNB declined with age in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and putamen. Scatchard analysis showed that the reduced binding was due to a decline in the number of receptors. The binding of the dopaminergic ligands was determined in the caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum and substantia nigra. [3H]Spiroperidol binding showed age-dependent decline in all the brain areas examined, while no change was seen in [3H]flupenthixol binding in any brain area studied. Also the decrease in [3H]spiroperidol binding was due to the reduced number of receptors. The results of this study suggest that aging is more likely to affect certain neurotransmitter receptor systems than certain brain areas.
22013229	The impact of aging on memory T cell phenotype and function in the human bone marrow.	aging	2012-02-??	Recently, the BM has been shown to play a key role in regulating the survival and function of memory T cells. However, the impact of aging on these processes has not yet been studied. We demonstrate that the number of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells in the BM is maintained during aging. However, the composition of the T cell pool in the aged BM is altered with a decline of naïve and an increase in T(EM) cells. In contrast to the PB, a highly activated CD8⁺CD28⁻ T cell population, which lacks the late differentiation marker CD57, accumulates in the BM of elderly persons. IL-6 and IL-15, which are both increased in the aged BM, efficiently induce the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of CD8⁺ T cells in vitro, highlighting a role of these cytokines in the age-dependent accumulation of highly activated CD8⁺CD28⁻ T cells in the BM. Yet, these age-related changes do not impair the maintenance of a high number of polyfunctional memory CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells in the BM of elderly persons. In …
10404022	Age-related changes in bone turnover in men.	aging	1999-07-??	Biochemical markers of bone turnover can be used to study the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. So far there have been few such studies in men. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of aging on bone turnover and to identify which hormones might regulate bone turnover in men. We studied 178 healthy Caucasian men, ages 20-79 years (30 per decade). The data for the effect of age on bone turnover was best fit by a quadratic function (nadirs at age 56, 57, 53, 39, and 58 years for intact propeptide of type I procollagen, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, free deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen, respectively). For most markers, bone turnover tended to be highest in the third decade, lowest in the fifth and sixth decade, with a small increase in some markers in the eighth decade. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, estradiol, and free androgen ind…
9255759	Contribution of IL-1 beta to the enhancement of Campylobacter rectus lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PGE2 production in old gingival fibroblasts in vitro.	aging	1997-10-??	Campylobacter rectus is associated with adult periodontitis. We previously reported that C. rectus lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in old cells of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) is higher than that in young cells. The present study examined whether an enhancement of C. rectus LPS-stimulated interleukin (IL)-1 beta production in old HGFs contributed to the increased production of PGE2. LPS was prepared from C. rectus ATCC33238. HGFs were established from healthy gingiva in three patients, aged 10-12 years. Cellular aging in culture was determined with increasing doubling. The cultured cells were treated with LPS (0.01-10 micrograms/ml), and the amount of IL-1 beta in the medium was measured after a 24 h incubation. The LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta production in each old cell (corresponding to 57-67% of complete life-span) was increased (1.6-2.6 times) compared to that in the young cells (corresponding to 17-20% of the life-span).

9735924	Excessive vasoconstriction after stress by the aging kidney: inadequate prostaglandin modulation of increased endothelin activity.	aging	1998-09-??	The adaptive capacity of the aging kidney to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, as induced by a 30-minute mental stress (MS), was assessed in 8 elderly healthy women (68 to 82 years of age) and compared with that of 8 younger women (24 to 40 years of age). The study encompassed 4 consecutive 30-minute periods (baseline, mental stress, recovery 1, and recovery 2). In the elderly subjects, baseline effective renal plasma flow (ERPF)(iodine 131-labeled hippurate clearance) was lower and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)(iodine 125-labeled iothalamate clearance) was proportionally less reduced than in the younger group; the filtration fraction (FF) was higher. The elderly group excreted more endothelin 1 (ET-1) (P < .05), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto PGF1alpha)(P < .001 for both)(radioimmunoassay). Mental stress induced similar increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamines in the 2 age groups, limited to the stimulation p…
12459877	Proliferative activity and expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 and p53 protein in endothelial cells of human aorta during replicative aging in vitro.	aging	2002-07-??	Experiments with bromodeoxyuridine showed that the count of nonproliferating cells in a monolayer culture of aortic endothelial cells from adult humans rapidly increased during long-term subculturing. Cytochemical assay showed that these cells contain neutral b-galactosidase, the marker of aging cells. Immunocytochemical assay demonstrated that most cells express p53 protein and inhibitor of the cell cycle p21WAF1.
15474517	L-carnosine reduces telomere damage and shortening rate in cultured normal fibroblasts.	lifespan	2004-11-12	Telomere is the repetitive DNA sequence at the end of chromosomes, which shortens progressively with cell division and limits the replicative potential of normal human somatic cells. L-carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide, has been reported to delay the replicative senescence, and extend the lifespan of cultured human diploid fibroblasts. In this work, we studied the effect of carnosine on the telomeric DNA of cultured human fetal lung fibroblast cells. Cells continuously grown in 20 mM carnosine exhibited a slower telomere shortening rate and extended lifespan in population doublings. When kept in a long-term nonproliferating state, they accumulated much less damages in the telomeric DNA when cultured in the presence of carnosine. We suggest that the reduction in telomere shortening rate and damages in telomeric DNA made an important contribution to the life-extension effect of carnosine.
4182373	Lipofuscin (aging) pigment granules of the newborn human liver.	aging	1969-07-??	We have observed pigmented cytoplasmic granules, with the characteristic staining properties of lipofuscin (ceroid, "wear-and-tear") pigment, in newborn human liver. The pigment is found at the periphery of the lobule in hepatocytes and some bile ductular cells. It is acid-fast, PAS-positive after diastase digestion, slightly argyophilic and sudanophilic, and markedly Schmorl's- and peroxidase positive in paraffin sections. Difficult to see in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the pigment can be detected in unstained sections. The granules also resemble lipofuscin found in adult tissues, in their ultra-structural and enzymatic properties. They are polymorphic, contain granular material of moderate and high electron opacity, and are delimited by a single membrane. Acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activities are visualized in the newborn granules, identifying them as lysosomes. The granules also contain copper and, to a much lesser extent, iron. The accumulation of lipo…
17550960	Endocrine features of menstrual cycles in middle and late reproductive age and the menopausal transition classified according to the Staging of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system.	aging	2007-08-??	CONTEXT: Female reproductive aging based on changes in menstrual cycle length and frequency progresses through a number of stages as defined by the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging criteria.    OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a comprehensive description of the endocrine features associated with the STRAW stages.    DESIGN: Healthy women aged 21-35 and 45-55 yr submitted three blood samples a week over a single menstrual cycle. They were classified as mid-reproductive age (n = 21), late-reproductive age (n = 16), early menopause transition (n = 16), and late menopause transition (n = 23).    RESULTS: There were nine, one, zero, and two anovulatory cycles identified in the late menopause transition, early menopause transition, late-reproductive age, and mid-reproductive age groups, respectively. Ovulatory cycle FSH, LH, and estradiol levels increased with progression of STRAW stage (P = 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively), and mean luteal phase serum progeste…
8469490	Successful delivery after age 50: a report of two cases as a result of oocyte donation.	aging	1993-05-??	BACKGROUND: Because of donor oocyte programs, women who previously were considered too old to successfully achieve conception and delivery can now bear children. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of pregnancy outcome in women over age 50 who conceived using donor oocytes. This study presents the pregnancy and delivery data on two women who delivered at age 52.    CASES: Case 1 was a 51-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, whose three children had been conceived with her first husband more than 20 years previously. She had remarried 18 years before presentation and had been actively trying to conceive for the last 7 years. She was diagnosed as being in menopause based on elevated gonadotropins, amenorrhea, and failure to have progesterone-withdrawal menses. She conceived on her first embryo transfer cycle with embryos derived from donor oocytes and fertilized by her husband's sperm (oocytes were donated by a woman who was undergoing retrieval for in vitro fertilization…
3798408	Age related changes in platelet lipid composition.	aging	1986-11-15	Platelet lipid composition was investigated in 52 healthy subjects aged 20 to 68 years with similar dietary habits and living in a narrow geographic area in order to search possible changes referrable to aging. No significant variations were observed when platelet cholesterol, total phospholipids and different phospholipid fractions were considered, whereas cholesterol/phospholipid (C/PL) molar ratio significantly increased with aging (p less than 0.01). Moreover, a significant increase in 16:0 + 16:1 fatty acids was found in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and in sphingomyelin (SP) (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001 and r = 0.30, p less than 0.05 respectively) and a decrease in 18:2 n6 in the phospholipid fractions considered (at least p less than 0.05). These results indicate that modifications in platelet lipid composition occur with aging and that they could affect platelet functions so playing a role in the onset of atherosclerosis and in thrombotic phenomena occurring with increasing frequenc…
25736139	Reproductive Hormones and Longitudinal Change in Bone Mineral Density and Incident Fracture Risk in Older Men: The Concord Health and Aging in Men Project.	aging	2015-09-??	The objectives of this study were to examine relationships between baseline levels of reproductive hormones in older men and (1) change in bone mineral density (BMD) over 5 years and (2) incident fractures over an average of 6 years' follow-up. A total of 1705 men aged 70 years and older from the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project (CHAMP) study were assessed at baseline (2005-2007), 2 years follow-up (2007-2009), and 5 years follow-up (2010-2013). At baseline, testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by immunoassay. Hip BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at all three time-points. Fracture data were collected at 4-monthly phone calls and verified radiographically. Statistical modeling was by general estimating equations and Cox model regression. Uni…
9467429	Monocyte cytokine production in an elderly population: effect of age and inflammation.	aging	1998-01-??	OBJECTIVE: To determine the association among aging, inflammation, and cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.    POPULATION AND METHODS: We examined production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and IL-6 in 711 elderly participants in the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 79 y) and 21 young healthy volunteers (mean age, 39 y). The elderly subjects were categorized by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, a marker of systemic inflammation.    RESULTS: Production of IL-6 (p < .00001) and IL-1Ra (p < .00001) was higher in the elderly subjects than in the control group. IL-6 production increased with increasing CRP, whereas IL-1RA was uniformly elevated in elderly subjects regardless of CRP. However, we found no difference in the production of IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha between the young and elderly groups, regardless of CRP status. IL-6 population correlated with IL-1 beta (r = .36, p < .00…
6420176	Age-related decline in lysosomal enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes after N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulation.	aging	1983-11-??	Aging is assumed to decrease lysosomal enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). A synthetic chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) was utilized to stimulate enzyme release of PMN from 45 human subjects, 21 males and 24 females, ranging in age from 22-83 yr old. Results of the studies showed no sex differences in the stimulation of enzyme release for either age group. However, stimulation was found to significantly decline in both males and females over 50 yr old compared to subjects under 50 yr old. The linear formulae for beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase and lysozyme in male subjects were Y = 6.5X + 617.2, Y = -1.9X + 311.5 and Y = -1.9X + 327.3 with correlation coefficient of -0.685, -0.352 and -0.401, respectively. The linear formulae in females were Y = -5.2X + 536.6, Y = -3.0X + 340.6 and Y = -1.7X + 333.6 with correlation coefficient of -0.582, -0.303 and -0.462, respectively. These findings suggest that there was an age-r…
23425890	Deficits in process-specific prefrontal and hippocampal activations contribute to adult age differences in episodic memory interference.	aging	2014-07-??	The ability to distinguish currently relevant from familiar but irrelevant memories is important in everyday life. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of age differences in the ability to withstand interference from similar past events. Younger and older adults worked on a continuous recognition task consisting of 3 consecutive runs. Each run was composed of the same set of word pairs, and participants were instructed to recognize word pair repetitions within runs. The monitoring demands associated with rejecting familiar, but currently irrelevant information were assumed to increase over consecutive runs. Over runs, older, but not younger adults showed decline in memory performance, whereas younger, but not older adults showed increasing engagement of anterior prefrontal cortex. Individual differences in cortical thickness and task-related activation of anterior prefrontal areas predicted performance differences within and across age groups. …
9116589	Densities of I2-imidazoline receptors, alpha 2-adrenoceptors and monoamine oxidase B in brains of suicide victims.	aging	1997-01-??	In the frontal cortex of suicide victims, the density of I2-imidazoline receptors labeled by [3H]idazoxan was lower (40%) than that in healthy subjects. In the same brains, the immunoreactivity of a 29/30 kDa imidazoline receptor protein was also found to be significantly decreased (19%) and it showed a positive correlation with the density of I2-imidazoline receptors. Also in the same brains, the density of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist binding sites labeled by [3H]RX821002 (2-methoxy idazoxan) was found to be unchanged. The density of brain I2-imidazoline receptors, correlated with aging in control subjects but not in suicides. The density of brain MAO-B sites labeled by [3H]Ro 19-6327 (lazabemide) in suicides was no different to that in age-matched controls. As expected the density of brain MAO-B sites in suicides showed a positive correlation with age, but it did not correlate with the density of I2-imidazoline receptors in the same brains. The data indicate that the I2-imidazoli…
9612155	Morphometric analysis of collagen and elastic fibers in normal skin and gingiva in relation to age.	aging	1997-09-??	The morphometric parameters of the human gingival elastic fiber network were determined by image analysis and compared with human skin elastic fibers in relation to age. Similarly, collagen fibers were also investigated in both tissues. In this study, 47 healthy patients, 10-75 years old were studied for gingiva and another 50 patients in the same age range were included for skin biopsies. Three groups were compared: group 1 from the age of 10-24 years, group 2 from 25 to 49 years, and group 3 from 50 to 75 years. The diameters of the oxytalan fibers were invariable in both tissues, whatever the age considered. On the other hand, the diameters of elastic fibers increased regularly with age in the gingiva (P < 0.01) and in the skin (P < 0.01) between each age group. The area fraction occupied by the oxytalan fibers decreased significantly in both tissues (P < 0.01) for the skin and (P < 0.001) for the gingiva. The area fraction occupied by the gingival elastic fibers remained constant w…
18302252	Gene expression analysis of major lineage-defining factors in human bone marrow cells: effect of aging, gender, and age-related disorders.	aging	2008-07-??	Adult bone marrow cells (BMCs) include two populations:;mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat; and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which produce all mature blood lineage. To study the effect of aging, gender, and age-related disorders on lineage differentiation, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to examine mRNA expression of the major factors defining BMC lineage, cbfa1 for osteoblasts, ppar-gamma for adipocytes, sox9 for chondrocytes, and rankl for osteoclasts, in bone marrow from 80 healthy subjects and patients (14-79 years old) with two age-related disorders: osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two apoptosis-related genes, bcl-2 and drak1, were studied. RANKL and PPAR-Gamma levels exhibited a clear positive correlation with age in female patients, but not in males, with a slight age-related decline in CBFa1 transcripts. DRAK1 expression showed an age-associated ascending trend with significantly greater transcripts of RA…
3080468	Responses of growth hormone (GH) and somatomedin-C to GH-releasing hormone in healthy aging men.	aging	1986-03-??	Although controversy exists regarding the effects of aging on GH secretory responses to indirect stimulation, in the only prior study of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-mediated GH secretion decreased GH responsivity occurred in healthy men after age 40 yr. We measured serum GH before and up to 180 min after and somatomedin-C (SM-C) levels before and 24 h after single morning bolus iv injections of GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 (1 microgram/kg) in 50 healthy fasted men, aged 21-86 yr, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Only subjects with a body mass index (BMI; kilograms per m2) between 20.0 and 29.0 were studied. Basal serum GH levels were undetectable (less than 0.7 ng/ml) in all but 2 men. Neither the frequency of GH responses (P greater than 0.8), the magnitude of response (P greater than 0.2), nor the timing (P greater than 0.05) of the peak GH responses to GHRH were significantly altered with age. Although BMI values did not vary significantly with age in our study group, there was a …
20657550	S6K1 is a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2 that connects nutrient status and DNA damage response.	aging	2010-09-01	p53 mediates DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence, and it is controlled by Mdm2, which mainly ubiquitinates p53 in the nucleus and promotes p53 nuclear export and degradation. By searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2. DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38alpha MAPK. The activated S6K1 forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response and likely in tumorigenesis. S6K1-Mdm2 interaction presents a route for cells to incorporate the metabolic/energy cues into DNA damage …
22314303	Vitamin D concentration and deficiency across different ages and genders.	lifespan, aging	2012-10-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem worldwide, especially in the elderly, so that an accurate assessment of its prevalence is essential for planning reliable healthcare policy throughout the lifespan. The aim of the present study was to assess the concentration as well as the mild and moderate deficiencies of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) across different ages and genders.    METHODS: We searched the database of the local Laboratory Information System to retrieve results of 25OHD tests performed on the whole cohort of presumably healthy Caucasian outpatients aged >12 yrs, who were referred to our laboratory in the North-East of Italy for routine laboratory testing ordered by general practitioners, over a 3-year period (October 2008-October 2011).    RESULTS: Cumulative results for 25OHD testing were retrieved for 2327 outpatients (1744 females and 583 males). No significant differences between females and males were observed for 25OHD values (71 [25-140] v…
19168035	TRPC3 protein is expressed across the lifespan in human prefrontal cortex and cerebellum.	lifespan	2009-03-13	The canonical transient receptor potential type 3 (TRPC3) channel is a non-selective, voltage-independent cation channel that is expressed in both excitable and non-excitable cells. As little is known regarding its presence in human brain and the influence of age on its expression, we examined TRPC3 protein expression by immunoblotting in postmortem prefrontal cortex and cerebellum obtained from subjects (8 days to 83 years) with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorder. The expression of TRPC3 protein in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area A9/A10) of the neonates/infants (<2 y) was significantly higher (25%) than that in the adolescent to adult (11y-83y) age group, whereas cerebellar TRPC3 levels showed no age-related changes. The results indicate that TRPC3 may be developmentally regulated in prefrontal cortex, and its expression in discrete human brain regions throughout the lifespan suggests a physiological role for TRPC3 during postnatal and adult life.
19568209	Progesterone and ovulation across stages of the transition to menopause.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Detailed characterization of progesterone and ovulation across the menopausal transition provides insight into conception risk and mechanisms of reproductive aging.    METHODS: Participants (n = 108, aged 25-58 y) collected daily urine specimens for 6-month intervals in each of 5 consecutive years. Specimens were assayed for pregnanediol glucuronide (PDG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estrone glucuronide (E1G). Reproductive stage was determined using cycle length variance. A hierarchical algorithm was used to identify ovulation. Linear mixed-effects models estimated (1) the frequency and day of ovulation by age and stage; (2) differences in FSH, LH, and E1G levels between ovulatory (O) and anovulatory (AO) cycles; and (3) total PDG levels and PDG levels in O cycles by age and stage.    RESULTS: The probability of AO cycles increased across the perimenopause (P < 0.0001); reproductive stage was a stronger predictor than age of the probabil…
9681876	Age-dependent changes and interrelations of number of cells and biochemical parameters (glucose, triglycerides, TBARS, calcium, phosphorus) in cultured human vein endothelial cells.	aging	1998-06-01	The aim of this study is to assess in human vein endothelial cells cultures the variations related to aging in: number of cells, glucose, triglycerides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), calcium, phosphorus, cholesterol, total protein and urea and to analyze the relation of these parameters between themselves. Eight parallel flasks were subjected to the natural aging process, one of them without cells, analyzed at eight chronological stages. The determinations of biochemical parameters were performed in culture medium when it was changed. The number of cells, glucose, triglycerides and TBARS show significant variations during the aging process (P < 0.001). The glucose uptake per cell is maintained relatively constant in time (0.9 ng/cell day). A high linear correlation between glucose and the number of cells (r=0.935), triglycerides and the number of cells (r=0.505), triglycerides and decrease in number of cells (r=0.805) is observed. The measurement of glucose uptake se…
2409037	In vitro restoration of immune responses in aging humans by isoprinosine.	aging	1985-??-??	The in vitro effects of isoprinosine (ISO) on the immune responses of aging humans were investigated. 64 healthy elderly humans (65 yr of age or over) were included in this study. Four immune parameters were measured, namely, Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell (NK) activity, neutrophil chemotaxis, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. The ConA-induced lymphocyte proliferation was depressed in 55 of the 64 individuals (85.9%%), while the NK activity was depressed in 41 of the 64 individuals (64%). Neutrophil chemotaxis was depressed in 52 of the 64 individuals (81.1%) and IL-2 production was depressed in 35 of the 64 individuals (54.6%). In the presence of ISO, ConA-induced lymphocyte proliferation, NK activity, neutrophil chemotaxis, and IL-2 production were restored to normal or near normal levels in 50 of the 55 (90.0%), 35 of the 41 (85.3%), 44 of the 52 (84.6%), and 25 of the 35 (71.4%) aging humans, respectively. Our results indicate that IS…
23811185	Do changes in circulating biomarkers track with each other and with functional changes in older adults?	aging	2014-02-??	BACKGROUND: It is unclear if changes in proposed circulating biomarkers of aging are strongly correlated to each other or functional change. We tested if biomarker changes track with each other and with functional measures over 9 years in older adults.    METHODS: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding proteins 1 (IGFBP-1) and 3 (IGFBP-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cholesterol, and function (gait speed, grip strength, Modified Mini Mental Status Exam [3MSE] and Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST] scores) were measured in 1996-1997 and 2005-2006 in the Cardiovascular Health Study All Stars study (N = 901, mean [standard deviation, SD] age 85.3 [3.6] years in 2005-2006). Adjusted Pearson correlations illustrated if biomarkers tracked together. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated if biomarker changes tracked with functional changes.    RESULTS: Correlations among biomarker changes were mostly <0.2. In models with each …
8991739	Correlates of self-rated health in persons aged 85 and over: results from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging.	aging	????-??-??	This report describes self-rated health in 1,239 non-institutionalized Canadians aged 85 years and over who participated in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. Most (76.8%) rated their health positively (i.e., very or pretty good). Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the variables that were significantly correlated with self-rated health. A modestly successful model for predicting self-rated health (R2 = 0.27) was developed. Better understanding of the determinants of healthy aging hopefully will lead to effective interventions to improve the quality of life of the very old.
29894333	Identification of Tracheobronchial Tree Calcifications Using Molecular Imaging Probes: 18F-NaF PET/CT.	aging	2018-08-??	Tracheobronchial calcifications are common in adults and considered as a physiological process of aging with no clinical significance in otherwise asymptomatic, healthy individuals. We are presenting a case of tracheobronchial tree calcifications as detected on F-NaF PET/CT in a 75-year-old woman. Many previous publications have reported the accumulation of NaF in extraosseous organs; these observations further set new directions in the evaluation of the metabolic activity of macrocalcification and microcalcification using molecular imaging probes.
3876494	Monocyte chemotactic responsiveness triggered by Lymphocyte-Derived Chemotactic Factor in aged donors. Definitive report.	aging	1985-??-??	Monocyte chemotactic responsiveness triggered by autologous Lymphocyte-Derived Chemotactic Factor (LDCF) has been evaluated in a group of aged donors. LDCF obtained from Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBL) supplemented with varying numbers of monocytes from aged donors gave a lower chemotactic response when compared to young donors. Moreover, when cell suspensions were pretreated with indomethacin (INDO) before LDCF production, an enhancement of LDCF-induced chemotaxis was observed in old individuals, this implying a prostaglandin-mediated suppression on LDCF release in the elderly. This lymphokine seems to be produced by T cells and, above all, OKT8+ cells, whose frequency is lower in aging. Interestingly, LDCF obtained from OKT8+ enriched cells supplemented with autologous monocytes induced in aged donors a chemotactic activity comparable to that observed in young subjects. These data suggest that the lower frequency of OKT8+ cells in the aging may play a key role in the impairment of…
22074806	Age-associated loss of selectivity in human olfactory sensory neurons.	aging	2012-09-??	We report a cross-sectional study of olfactory impairment with age based on both odorant-stimulated responses of human olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and tests of olfactory threshold sensitivity. A total of 621 OSNs from 440 subjects in 2 age groups of younger (≤ 45 years) and older (≥ 60 years) subjects were investigated using fluorescence intensity ratio fura-2 imaging. OSNs were tested for responses to 2 odorant mixtures, as well as to subsets of and individual odors in those mixtures. Whereas cells from younger donors were highly selective in the odorants to which they responded, cells from older donors were more likely to respond to multiple odor stimuli, despite a loss in these subjects' absolute olfactory sensitivity, suggesting a loss of specificity. This degradation in peripheral cellular specificity may impact odor discrimination and olfactory adaptation in the elderly. It is also possible that chronic adaptation as a result of reduced specificity contributes to observed de…
12392764	Matrix-mediated cellular rejuvenation.	aging	2002-10-??	Biomaterial surface morphology and chemistry influence cell responses mediated via signaling cascades that regulate a wide range of metabolic processes. These responses may range from changes in surface adhesion and remodeling of the extracellular matrix to activation of cytokine, cytoskeletal and other biochemical pathways regulating or modulating cellular morphology and function. The present study has focused on collagen Type I, a key extracellular matrix protein, and its potential impact on the process of cellular aging. This study was undertaken for several reasons. First, several investigators reported that growth of cells on a collagen matrix markedly enhanced the resistance of cells to stresses. Second, a large body of accumulated data strongly indicated a relationship between the potential to respond to stresses and cellular aging with the former strongly influencing the rate of the latter. Finally, it has been recently demonstrated that in aged cells one of the key aging-relat…
25476063	Abuse and maltreatment in the elderly.	aging	2014-11-??	INTRODUCTION: The aging population is increasing worldwide, but the abuse and mistreatment in the elderly (often silenced forms) has also been increasing, with strong implications for their quality of life.    OBJECTIVE: To identify forms of abuse and ill-treatment in the elderly, as well as the determinants of these abuses.    METHODOLOGY: This is a quantitative study, of the non-experimental, descriptive, cross-sectional type attended by 135 Portuguese elderly. It uses the Family APGAR Scale and the Question to Elicit Elder Abuse (QEEA), which was applied between January and June 2013, in the elderly residing in the central of Portugal.    RESULTS: The data shows that 23.5% of the elderly have suffered some kind of abuse, these being especially of the emotional kind and neglect. We also found that the most abused elders were unmarried and widows, those who had lower academic qualifications, those who reported feeling lonely and less healthy and even those who perceive to integrate fa…
20382688	The exon 3 deleted growth hormone receptor gene is associated with small birth size and early pubertal onset in healthy boys.	aging	2010-06-??	CONTEXT: The GH/IGF-I axis influences gonadal development and function. Recently, a deletion of exon 3 in the GH receptor gene (GHRd3) has been linked to increased responsiveness to GH.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the influence of the GHRd3 gene on birth size and pubertal onset.    DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional study, part of The COPENHAGEN Puberty Study, at a tertiary center for pediatric endocrinology.    PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 618 healthy boys aged 6.1-19.8 yr.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed pubertal onset by genital staging and testicular palpation and parental reported birth weight and length. GHR genotypes were determined by multiplex PCR.    RESULTS: Age at onset of genital development (G2+) was significantly earlier in the GHRd3 homozygotes (GHRd3/d3) [10.86 (10.35-11.37) yr, mean (95% confidence interval)] compared with the full-length homozygotes (GHRfl/fl) [11.76 (11.35-12.00) yr, P = 0.002]. The odds ratio of having d…
17460203	Activation of pericentromeric and telomeric heterochromatin in cultured lymphocytes from old individuals.	aging	2007-04-??	The functional characteristics of chromosomes (level of total heterochromatin, chromosome instability, and sister chromatid exchanges [SCEs]) were studied in cultured lymphocytes derived from 80- to 91-year-old and 18- to 30-year-old (control group) individuals under the single and combined effect of CoCl(2) and bioregulator Livagen. The results obtained showed that chromosome heterochromatinization (condensation of eu- and heterochromatin regions) had progressively increased with aging and led to inactivation of a number of once functioning "active genes." The peptide bioregulator Livagen could induce reactivation (deheterochromatinization) of chromatin to modify heterochromatinized chromosomal regions in cultured lymphocytes of aged individuals. Our results indicated that metal ions (CoCl(2)) caused a significant increase in the level of chromosomal aberrations in old donors in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). The peptide bioregulator Livagen was effective in decreasing …
26209847	Default Mode Network Activity Predicts Early Memory Decline in Healthy Young Adults Aged 18-31.	aging	2016-??-??	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research conducted in healthy young adults is typically done with the assumption that this sample is largely homogeneous. However, studies from cognitive psychology suggest that long-term memory and attentional control begin to diminish in the third decade of life. Here, 100 participants between the ages of 18 and 31 learned Lithuanian translations of English words in an individual differences study using fMRI. Long-term memory ability was operationalized for each participant by deriving a memory score from 3 convergent measures. Age of participant predicted memory score in this cohort. In addition, degree of deactivation during initial encoding in a set of regions occurring largely in the default mode network (DMN) predicted both age and memory score. The current study demonstrates that early memory decline may partially be accounted for by failure to modulate activity in the DMN.
23999190	Mineralization and collagen orientation throughout aging at the vertebral endplate in the human lumbar spine.	aging	2013-11-??	The human vertebral body and intervertebral disc interface forms the region where the cartilaginous endplate, annulus fibrosis and bone of the vertebral body are connected through an intermediate calcified cartilage layer. While properties of both the vertebral body and components of the disc have been extensively studied, limited quantitative data exists describing the microstructure of the vertebral body-intervertebral disc interface in the spine throughout development and degeneration. Quantitative backscattered scanning electron and second harmonic generation confocal imaging were used to collect quantitative data describing the mineral content and collagen fiber orientation across the interface, respectively. Specimens spanned ages 56 days to 84 years and measurements were taken across the vertebral endplate at the outer annulus, inner annulus and nucleus pulposis. In mature and healthy endplates, collagen fibers span the calcified cartilage layer in all regions, including the end…
7790387	Esterification of 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid into the phospholipids of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: inhibition of the proliferative response.	aging	1995-07-??	12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), the lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid produced by activated platelets, has been shown to accumulate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of elderly people. 12-HETE being antimitogenic for lymphocytes, its accumulation in blood cells might be involved in the well-known decline in immune function which accompanies aging. Because HETEs have been shown to be rapidly metabolized and/or incorporated into cellular lipids in a variety of cell types, we have investigated the uptake, metabolism, and intracellular distribution of exogenous 12-HETE by human PBMC. [3H]-12-HETE was dose and time dependently incorporated by PBMC and also metabolized to more polar products. These polar metabolites were mainly released extracellularly and only marginally esterfied in phospholipids. Although [3H]-12-HETE radiolabel was preferentially associated with phosphatidylcholine, especially after prolonged labeling incubations or following successive s…
7219911	Changes in circulating steroids with aging in postmenopausal women.	aging	1981-05-??	to examine the possible effects of aging on circulating steroid hormones in postmenopausal women, blood samples were drawn from 155 women, aged 34 to 83 years, with spontaneous ovarian failure. The C-21 steroids, pregnenolone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone; the delta 4 progestins, progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone; and cortisol did not change with age and were similar in concentration to the levels measured during the follicular phase of premenopausal women. The delta 5 androgens, dehydropiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, declined significantly (P less than .001) with age, whereas no change was noted in the delta 4 androgens, androstenedione and testosterone. The levels of estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were strongly correlated with percent ideal weight but did not change with age. The authors conclude that 1) The production of progestins does not change with age in normal adult women, other than that resulting from the loss of secretion associated with ovarian corpu…
11961365	Cardiovascular responses to lower body negative pressure in the elderly: role of reduced leg compliance.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: It is warranted to test the hypothesis that the orthostatic tolerance does not diminish in the aging process per se in healthy individuals.    OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of aging on cardiovascular response and baroreflex sensitivity during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) with a special reference to leg compliance.    METHODS: Fifteen healthy old male subjects [mean age 68.2 +/- (SE) 0.8 years] and 22 young male subjects [mean age 21.4 +/- (SE) 0.3 years] underwent a 21-min bout of ramped LBNP (from 0 to -60 mm Hg, 10 mm Hg each for 3 min). Heart rate (HR), blood pressure, stroke volume (SV), forearm blood flow, and leg volume were measured throughout the experimental period. The arterial baroreflex sensitivity was calculated from spontaneous changes in beat-to-beat arterial pressure and HR during LBNP.    RESULTS: The leg compliance was lower, and the orthostatic tolerance index was higher in old than in young participants. Th…
17114451	Generation and growth of CD28nullCD8+ memory T cells mediated by IL-15 and its induced cytokines.	aging	2006-12-01	Accumulation of CD28(null)CD8+ T cells and the defects of these cells in response to antigenic stimulation are the hallmarks of age-associated decline of T cell function. However, the mechanism of these age-associated changes is not fully understood. In this study, we report an analysis of the growth of human CD28(null) and CD28+CD8+ memory T cells in response to homeostatic cytokine IL-15 in vitro. We showed that 1) there was no proliferative defect of CD28(null)CD8+ memory T cells in response to IL-15 compared with their CD28+ counterparts; 2) stable loss of CD28 expression occurred in those actively dividing CD28+CD8+ memory T cells responding to IL-15; 3) the loss of CD28 was in part mediated by TNF-alpha that was induced by IL-15; and 4) CCL4 (MIP-1beta), also induced by IL-15, had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of CD28(null) cells, which in turn down-regulated their expression of CCL4 receptor CCR5. Together, these findings demonstrate that CD28(null)CD8+ memory T …
7142992	Age-correlated loss of dopaminergic binding sites in human basal ganglia.	aging	1982-12-??	Human caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, and nucleus accumbens were analyzed for the effects of age on dopaminergic binding sites. Decreases in the number of dopaminergic binding sites were detected with age in caudate nucleus (44 specimens from three sample groups) and substantia nigra (n = 12). In caudate nucleus, the decline in [3H]2-amino-6, 7-dehydroxy-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydronaphthalene sites was three times greater than for [3H]spiperone, but age changes were significant in only two of the three sampling groups. No age changes in binding were detected in the putamen (n = 44) or nucleus accumbens. Age, sex, and tissue source all significantly contributed to variance. However, cause of death, time from death to tissue freezing, and length of storage did not influence dopaminergic binding in the caudate nucleus or putamen. Relative to the life-span, the age-correlated decrease in dopaminergic binding sites of human brain approximates that in aging rodent striatum. Comparisons…
26829571	Factors that bring meaning to mementos created by elders.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVES: Reminiscing activity groups are commonly seen in various elder care settings This study addresses the impact of reminiscence activity groups, specifically a program where group members create their own mementos, on healthy Jewish elders' sense of satisfaction and meaning. In particular, this research focused on the specific factors involved in creating the mementos themselves.    METHOD: In this mixed methods study, occupational therapy graduate students synthesized relevant aspects of commonly used activity analysis forms into a matrix to analyze the activities. From a pool of 30 activities, students chose seven representing many factors and levels of complexity. With a matrix composed of a Likert scale and open-ended questions, students and Jewish elders explored the elders' perceptions of factors significantly related to their experiences when creating the seven mementos.    RESULTS: Memento-making was most satisfying when elders were replicated in some way, such as with…
24727593	Proteasome-mediated quality control of S-nitrosylated mitochondrial proteins.	aging	2014-07-??	Accumulating low level mitochondrial insults are thought to be key to aging processes and neurodegeneration. Among other stressors, protein damage due to nitrosative stress negatively impacts mitochondrial function and is linked to neurodegeneration. Using biotin switch technique, we show that mitochondrial proteins are S-nitrosylated not only in the presence but also in the absence of exogenous nitrosative stress. In addition, we revealed a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the outer mitochondrial membrane associated degradation (OMMAD)-component p97 in the quality control of S-nitrosylated mitochondrial. Taken together, constant proteasome-mediated clearance of nitrosatively-damaged proteins from mitochondria is likely important for maintaining organelle function.
9775633	Faculty practice as partnership with a community coalition.	aging	????-??-??	Faculty practice as partnership with a community coalition can be a dynamic strategy for retooling the future of nursing. The Escalante ElderCARE Coalition was formed in 1991, with the Community Health Division of the Arizona State College of Nursing taking a leadership role. Since that time, more than 50 aging network and community agencies have become involved. More than $300,000 in grant funding has been awarded for Healthy WAY services with low-income seniors as health care and program partners. The conceptual model includes health-promotion services, participation of community elders in program planning and evaluation, and education of health professionals. Participation theory is the basis for the conceptual model. A large number of undergraduate and graduate nursing students have been involved in the nontraditional delivery of services provided by the coalition. The Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Lifestyle Directions Questionnaire are the health status outcome measures, and elder…
17998499	Relationship between low levels of anabolic hormones and 6-year mortality in older men: the aging in the Chianti Area (InCHIANTI) study.	aging	2007-11-12	BACKGROUND: Aging in men is characterized by a progressive decline in levels of anabolic hormones, such as testosterone, insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). We hypothesized that in older men a parallel age-associated decline in bioavailable testosterone, IGF-1, and DHEA-S secretion is associated with higher mortality independent of potential confounders.    METHODS: Testosterone, IGF-1, DHEA-S, and demographic features were evaluated in a representative sample of 410 men 65 years and older enrolled in the Aging in the Chianti Area (InCHIANTI) study. A total of 126 men died during the 6-year follow-up. Thresholds for lowest-quartile definitions were 70 ng/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347) for bioavailable testosterone, 63.9 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.131) for total IGF-1, and 50 microg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.027) for DHEA-S. Men were divided into 4 groups: n…
17418992	Impairment of methionine sulfoxide reductase during UV irradiation and photoaging.	aging	2007-09-??	During chronic UV irradiation, which is part of the skin aging process, proteins are damaged by reactive oxygen species resulting in the accumulation of oxidatively modified protein. UV irradiation generates irreversible oxidation of the side chains of certain amino acids resulting in the formation of carbonyl groups on proteins. Nevertheless, certain amino acid oxidation products such as methionine sulfoxide can be reversed back to their reduced form within proteins by specific repair enzymes, the methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B. Using quantitative confocal microscopy, the amount of methionine sulfoxide reductase A was found significantly lower in sun-exposed skin as compared to sun-protected skin. Due to the importance of the methionine sulfoxide reductase system in the maintenance of protein structure and function during aging and conditions of oxidative stress, the fate of this system was investigated after UVA irradiation of human normal keratinocytes. When keratinocytes a…
7354241	The effect of age on serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone in normal and osteoporotic women.	aging	1980-03-??	Serum iPTH was measured in a large series of normal and osteoporotic women as a function of age, with radioimmunoassays using three antisera: GP-1M, which recognizes primarily a region within the 44--68 amino acid sequence of PTH; CH-12M, which appears to recognize primarily intact hormone; and CH-14M, which recognizes primarily a region within the 1--34 amino acid sequence of PTH. In normal women 20 to 90 years of age, serum iPTH increased significantly with age (p less than 0.001); the proportional increase was greater when measured with antiserum GP-1M (80%) than when measured with antiserum CH-12M (30%), which suggests that the increase in circulating carboxyl fragments of PTH was greater than the increase in circulating intact PTH. In 40 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the mean value for serum iPTH assayed by antiserum GP-1M did not differ significantly from that for age-matched normal women; however, three osteoporotic patients had elevated values and thus appear to re…
6966291	The cellular basis of impaired T lymphocyte functions in the elderly.	aging	1980-06-??	Immunologic changes associated with aging were studied by various immunologic tests in 24 aged persons (age range, 76-83) and 25 young persons (age range, 20-40). The responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) were depressed in the aged subjects compared to the young ones (p less than 0.05), whereas the responses to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) were similar. The activity of adhereent and non-adherent cells was assessed in various combinations. The adherent cells of aged persons were indistinguishable from those of young persons in their ability to response to Con A. Lymphocytes from the aged synthesized larger in vitro amounts of immunoglobulin than did lymphocytes from the young, when stimulated with PWM. Con A-stimulated T lymphocytes derived from aged subjects showed a variable loss of suppressor activity. The mixed lymphocyte culture reaction with mitomycin-treated allogeneic and autologous cells was also impaired in aged subjects. Such an impaired response in the a…
9095320	Regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in a patient with Korsakoff syndrome.	aging	1997-02-??	We report a functional neuroimaging study of a patient clinically diagnosed with Korsakoff syndrome. Positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O inhalation method showed decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and decreased regional cerebral metabolic ratio for oxygen (rCMRO2) in the bilateral fronto-temporal areas and in the left thalamus. These results suggest that dysfunction of the frontal-thalamic neural network plays a role in the disturbance of Korsakoff syndrome.
20381476	Aging mechanism of butyrylcholinesterase inhibited by an N-methyl analogue of tabun: implications of the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state rearrangement for the phosphylation or reactivation of cholinesterases.	aging	2010-09-06	Cholinesterases are the main target of organophosphorus nerve agents (OPs). Their inhibition results in cholinergic syndrome and death. The enzymes are inhibited by phosphylation of the catalytic serine enzyme, but can be reactivated by oximes to some extent. However, phosphylated cholinesterases undergo a side reaction that progressively prevents their reactivatability. This unimolecular reaction, termed "aging", has been investigated for decades. It was shown that most OP-ChE conjugates aged by O-dealkylation of an alkoxy substituent of the phosphorus atom, a mechanism involving the stabilization of a transient carbocation. In this paper we present structural data supporting a substitution-based mechanism for aging of the huBChE conjugate of an N-mono-methyl analogue of tabun. This mechanism involves an adjacent nucleophilic attack followed by Berry pseudorotation. A similar adjacent attack and subsequent rearrangement of the transition state have been recently proposed for tabun pho…
23723437	Doing it my way.	aging	2014-08-??	PURPOSE: Historically, hotels and single-room occupancy residences have provided room, board, and social support services to elders, in particular the poor and the disenfranchised. This article presents the results of a case study drawn from a larger ethnographic community study that set forth to describe how and why elders from one rural community chose to live in a motel in that same rural community. The focus of this study is a description of 7 middle-income and affluent rural elders living in a motel setting as a housing option that enabled them to remain independent in their community.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a community study ethnographic design and the strategies of formal and informal interviews, participant observation, and inductive comparative case study analysis, this study provides a description of why these elders decided to live in the motel and how this facilitated their living in the community.    RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS: Reasons that these elders decided to live…
24925765	Correlates of low testosterone in men with chronic spinal cord injury.	aging	2014-09-??	Although high rates of serum testosterone deficiency have been reported in men with spinal cord injury (SCI), its determinants and attributes are not yet established. The aim of this study was to recognize, among putative determinants and attributes of androgen deficiency, those significantly associated to low testosterone after adjustment for confounders recognizable in men with chronic SCI. A biochemical androgen deficiency (total testosterone <300 ng/dL) was exhibited by 18 of 51 patients (35.3%). Significant correlates of testosterone levels were as follows: weekly leisure time physical activity (LTPA) explored by the LTPA Questionnaire for people with SCI, body mass index (BMI), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides and sexual symptoms, explored by the aging males' symptom (AMS) questionnaire. At the multiple linear regression analysis, among putative determinants of low testosterone, only weekly LTPA and BMI exhibited a significant associatio…
27676213	Disruption of PCNA-lamins A/C interactions by prelamin A induces DNA replication fork stalling.	aging	2016-09-02	The accumulation of prelamin A is linked to disruption of cellular homeostasis, tissue degeneration and aging. Its expression is implicated in compromised genome stability and increased levels of DNA damage, but to date there is no complete explanation for how prelamin A exerts its toxic effects. As the nuclear lamina is important for DNA replication we wanted to investigate the relationship between prelamin A expression and DNA replication fork stability. In this study we report that the expression of prelamin A in U2OS cells induced both mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and subsequent induction of Pol η, two hallmarks of DNA replication fork stalling. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells expressing prelamin A presented with high levels of colocalisation between PCNA and γH2AX, indicating collapse of stalled DNA replication forks into DNA double-strand breaks. Subsequent protein-protein interaction assays showed prelamin A interacted with P…
10937647	Information Multiple Choice among healthy older adults: characteristics, correlates, and clinical implications.	aging	1999-02-??	Information Multiple Choice (WAIS-R-NI, Kaplan et al., 1991), may be valuable when used in conjunction with the standard Information subtest. Due to the reduced retrieval demands posed by its recognition format, scores should be even less susceptible to neuropathology or normal aging than are those on the standard (recall) test, facilitating assessment of premorbid attainment in individuals suffering from retrieval-related memory deficits. We provide reliability, validity, and normative data on Information Multiple Choice from a sample (N = 177) of healthy adults aged 50 - 90 years. Information Multiple Choice correlates strongly with the standard Information subtest (r = .81) and, as predicted and unlike the standard test, does not decline even in very old age. The construct validity of Information Multiple Choice is supported, and its clinical utility will be enhanced by these normative data.
23939401	Tablet-based strength-balance training to motivate and improve adherence to exercise in independently living older people: a phase II preclinical exploratory trial.	aging	2013-08-12	BACKGROUND: Reaction time, coordination, and cognition performance typically diminish in older adults, which may lead to gait impairments, falls, and injuries. Regular strength-balance exercises are highly recommended to reduce this problem and to improve health, well-being, and independence in old age. However, many older people face a lack of motivation in addition to other strong barriers to exercise. We developed ActiveLifestyle, an information technology (IT)-based system for active and healthy aging aiming at improving balance and strength. ActiveLifestyle is a training app that runs on a tablet and assists, monitors, and motivates older people to follow personalized training plans autonomously at home.    OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to (1) investigate which IT-mediated motivation strategies increase adherence to physical exercise training plans in older people, (2) assess the impact of ActiveLifestyle on physical activity behavior change, and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness…
9095086	Relative influence of menopausal status, age, and body mass index on blood pressure.	aging	1997-04-??	The objective of this study was to assess the influence of menopausal status on blood pressure levels in a cross-sectional population study in the setting of a preventive health care program clinically conducted in Ferrara, Italy. The patients were 2397 healthy women 35 to 65 years old (489 in premenopause, 847 in perimenopause, 887 in spontaneous menopause, and 174 in surgical menopause); subgroups were also obtained with increasing duration of menopause (1 to > 5 years) matched with premenopausal and perimenopausal women by chronological age at onset of menopause. Measurements of sphygmomanometric blood pressure, age, age at menopause, duration of menopause, and body mass index were made. Postmenopausal women had higher blood pressure than premenopausal and perimenopausal subjects. After adjustment for body mass index, the blood pressure changes with menopausal status were still significant, but not after correction by age. The increased risk of hypertension of postmenopausal women a…
28291957	Effect of intranasally administered insulin on cerebral blood flow and perfusion; a randomized experiment in young and older adults.	longevity, aging	2017-??-14	Insulin, a vasoactive modulator regulating peripheral and cerebral blood flow, has been consistently linked to aging and longevity. In this proof of principle study, using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design, we explored the effects of intranasally administered insulin (40IU) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and perfusion in older (60-69 years, n=11) and younger (20-26 years, n=8) adults. Changes in CBF through the major cerebropetal arteries were assessed via phase contrast MR-angiography, and regional cortical tissue perfusion via pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling. Total flow through the major cerebropetal arteries was unchanged in both young and old. In the older participants, intranasal insulin compared to placebo increased perfusion through the occipital gray matter (65.2±11.0 mL/100g/min vs 61.2±10.1 mL/100g/min, P=0.001), and in the thalamus (68.28±6.75 mL/100g/min versus 63.31±6.84 mL/100g/min, P=0.003). Thus, intranasal insulin improved tissue…
6615888	Detection of nonenzymatic browning products in the human lens.	aging	1983-10-04	The nonenzymatic browning or Maillard reaction is an aging process in stored foods. The initial stage of this reaction, nonenzymatic glycosylation, has been shown to occur in the human lens. The possible occurrence of further steps of the Maillard reaction involving lysine residues and glucose has been investigated. A lipid-free protein extract from a pool of human cataractous lenses was reduced, alkylated, and digested with pronase. The digest was reduced with [3H]borohydride, acid hydrolyzed and fractionated by Sephadex G-15 chromatography. The fractions eluting ahead of epsilon-1-deoxyglucitolyllysine were pooled and separated with an amino acid analyzer. Four fluorescent, yellow, and radioactive peaks were obtained. One of these, which co-eluted with tyrosine, was isolated, acetylated, and further analyzed by reverse phase chromatography using HPLC. Two new peaks were separated which co-chromatographed with lysine derivatives isolated from the nonenzymatic browning reaction of alph…
21945346	Age-related changes in the three-way correlation between anterior hippocampus volume, whole-brain patterns of encoding activity and subsequent context retrieval.	aging	2011-10-28	Age-related declines in memory for context have been linked to volume loss in the hippocampal head (HH) with age. However, it remains unclear how this volumetric decline correlates with age-related changes in whole-brain activity during context encoding, and subsequent context retrieval. In the current study we examine this. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data in young and older adults during the encoding of item, spatial context and temporal context. HH volume and subsequent retrieval performance was measured in all participants. In young adults only there was a positive three-way correlation between larger HH volumes, better memory retrieval, and increased activity in right hippocampus, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and midline brain regions during episodic encoding. In contrast, older adults exhibited a positive three-way association between HH volume, generalized activity in bilateral hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC across all encoding tasks, an…
17379683	End-of-life health care planning among young-old adults: an assessment of psychosocial influences.	aging	2007-03-??	OBJECTIVES: End-of-life planning among healthy older adults may protect them from unwanted medical treatments in later life, in the event that they become incapable of making health care decisions for themselves. We explore two formal and one informal components of end-of-life planning (living will, durable power of attorney for health care, and discussions) and assess whether one's health and health care encounters, personal beliefs, and experience with others' deaths affect these practices.    METHODS: Using two waves of data (1992-1993 and 2004) from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we estimated binary and multinomial logistic regression models to predict end-of-life preparations among a sample of community-dwelling persons aged 64-65 (N=3,838).    RESULTS: Recent hospitalizations, personal beliefs (Death Avoidance and the belief that doctors should control health care decisions), and recent experience with the painful death of a loved one all influence end-of-life preparations. Co…
11744333	Reduced levels of oxidized and glycoxidized proteins in human fibroblasts exposed to repeated mild heat shock during serial passaging in vitro.	aging	2001-12-15	Repeated mild heat shock (RMHS) has beneficial hormesis-like effects on various characteristics of human skin fibroblasts undergoing replicative senescence in vitro. We have tested whether RMHS could reduce the accumulation of oxidized and glycoxidized proteins, which is a major age-related change. Levels of carbonylated proteins, furosine, N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine-rich proteins and advanced glycation end products increased during serial passaging of fibroblasts in culture. However, the extent of accumulation of oxidized and glycoxidized proteins was significantly reduced in RMHS cells. The basal concentration of reduced glutathione was higher and that of oxidized glutathione was lower in RMHS cells. Whereas the basal level of heat shock protein HSP27 decreased in both RMHS and control cells during serial passaging, the increase of the basal level of HSP70 with increasing passage level was significantly higher in RMHS cells. These results show that the slower accumulation of dam…
7452090	Functional fractionation of platelets.	aging	1981-02-??	Studies of platelet populations suggest that they are heterogeneous in size, age, and metabolic parameters. In an attempt to correlate these parameters with efficiency of aggregation, a new technique, functional fractionation, was developed. Platelet populations are separated by their differential reactivity to aggregating agents. For example, low doses of ADP (0.1 to 0.7 microM) are added to stirred PRP, after which gentle centrifugation is used to remove aggregates from single unreacted platelets. The loose aggregates can be readily dispersed for comparison of the physical or biochemical properties of the reacted versus unreacted platelets. It was found that reactive platelets were larger (6.5  micrometer3) than unreacted platelets (5.51 micrometer3). No significant difference in density existed between the two populations, and no release of [14C]serotonin from prelabeled platelets occurred during functional fractionation. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the s…
10947951	Age-related accumulation of Maillard reaction products in human articular cartilage collagen.	aging	2000-09-01	Non-enzymic modification of tissue proteins by reducing sugars, the so-called Maillard reaction, is a prominent feature of aging. In articular cartilage, relatively high levels of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) pentosidine accumulate with age. Higher pentosidine levels have been associated with a stiffer collagen network in cartilage. However, even in cartilage, pentosidine levels themselves represent <1 cross-link per 20 collagen molecules, and as such cannot be expected to contribute substantially to the increase in collagen network stiffness. In the present study, we investigated a broad range of Maillard reaction products in cartilage collagen in order to determine whether pentosidine serves as an adequate marker for AGE levels. Not only did the well-characterized AGEs pentosidine, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine, and N(epsilon)-(carboxyethyl)lysine increase with age in cartilage collagen (all P<0.0001), but also general measures of AGE cross-linking, such as browning an…

20048548	Interplay of oxidants and antioxidants during exercise: implications for muscle health.	aging	2009-12-??	Muscle contraction results in generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) at a rate determined by the intensity, frequency, and duration of the exercise protocols. Strenuous exercise causes oxidation of protein, lipid, and DNA, release of cytosolic enzymes, and other signs of cell damage; however, only exhaustive exercise is detrimental. Indeed, the regulation of vascular tone, the excitation-contraction coupling, growth, and differentiation in skeletal muscle, are governed in part by RONS. This is accomplished by RONS interaction with redox-sensitive transcription factors, leading to increased gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, cytoprotective proteins, and other enzymes involved in muscle metabolic functions. However, high levels of RONS generation are known to cause oxidative stress, activate certain pathogenic pathways, and accelerate aging. This article reviews research from the past decades on the interplay of oxidants and antioxidants in skeletal muscle, with p…
17324821	Collagen glycation triggers the formation of aged skin in vitro.	aging	????-??-??	Glycation products accumulate during the aging of many slowly renewing tissues, including skin. We have developed an in vitro model of chronologic aging of skin based on reconstructed skin modified by artificially glycating the collagen used to prepare the dermal compartment. The morphology of the modified skin is close to the morphology usually observed except that the dermis is altered in its fibrillar structure. Moreover, the analysis of skin markers revealed several unexpected biological and morphological modifications, which reflect in vivo aging and could be related to glycation per se. These include the activation of fibroblasts, increase of matrix molecules (collagen type III and collagen type IV) and metalloproteinase production (MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9), thickening of the basement membrane zone, and more strikingly, the modification of alpha6 and beta1 integrin patterns especially in epidermis, in a way closely resembling aged skin in vivo. We also found that these effects could …
25750252	BOLD Variability is Related to Dopaminergic Neurotransmission and Cognitive Aging.	aging	2016-05-??	Dopamine (DA) losses are associated with various aging-related cognitive deficits. Typically, higher moment-to-moment brain signal variability in large-scale patterns of voxels in neocortical regions is linked to better cognitive performance and younger adult age, yet the physiological mechanisms regulating brain signal variability are unknown. We explored the relationship among adult age, DA availability, and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability, while younger and older participants performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task. We quantified striatal and extrastriatal DA D1 receptor density with [(11)C]SCH23390 and positron emission tomography in all participants. We found that BOLD variability in a neocortical region was negatively related to age and positively related to SWM performance. In contrast, BOLD variability in subcortical regions and bilateral hippocampus was positively related to age and slower responses, and negatively related to D1 density in caudate …
24014401	Mass spectrometry-based detection of protein acetylation.	aging	2013-??-??	Improved sample preparation techniques and increasingly sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) analysis have revolutionized the study of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Rush et al., Nat Biotechnol 23:94-101, 2005). Here, we describe a general approach for immunopurification and MS-based identification of acetylated proteins in biological samples. This approach is useful to characterize changes in the acetylome in response to biological interventions (Schwer et al., Aging Cell 8:604-606, 2009).
994559	Altered protein metabolism in arrested populations of aging human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1976-??-??	Protein synthesis and turnover were measured in human diploid fibroblasts which were arrested in an essentially nonmitotic state by reducing the serum concentration in the incubation medium to 0.5%. Through the first 4 days of the arrested period both early and late passage cells lost about 20% of their cellular protein. There was a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis at both passage levels during this period, but there was no significant age-related difference in the synthetic rate or the rate of protein turnover. After day 4 both early and late passage cells maintained a constant protein content, but late passage cells did this while processing more protein through faster rates of both synthesis and turnover than did early passage cells. These results support those theories of cellular senescence which predict altered protein metabolism as a major consequence of the aging process.
27246314	Cognitive performance in unipolar old-age depression: a longitudinal study.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Previous studies on cognitive deficits in acute and remitted states of old-age depression have shown mixed findings. The episodic nature of depression makes repeated assessment of cognitive performance important in order to address reversibility and stability of cognitive deficits.    METHODS: Dementia-free older participants (≥60 years) from the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen who completed neuropsychological testing at baseline (T1) and follow-up (T2) formed the basis of the study sample. Participants were grouped according to depression status at T1 and T2: depressed-remitted (n = 32), remitted-depressed (n = 45), and nondepressed-depressed (n = 29). These groups were compared with a group of randomly selected and matched (age, gender, education, and follow-up time) healthy controls (n = 106) over a period of maximum 6 years.    RESULTS: Mixed ANCOVAs, controlling for age and gender, revealed depression-related deficits for process…
6311425	Circulating beta-endorphin levels at various stages of life: possible connections with migraine pathogenesis.	aging	1983-08-??	Recently, the existence of a circulating peptide, beta-endorphin (B-EP) with potent analgesic properties has been revealed. Our group has evaluated B-EP plasma levels in several physiological and pathological models. The life span pattern of this newly identified hormone was characterized by a progressive increase during prepuberal development, by stable levels in adults with typical circadian and monthly variations, and by a decrease in aging subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid B-EP contents inversely showed a declining linear trend throughout life, which suggests an independent source of B-EP in this compartment. The concomitant changes in the reproductive system suggested the possible influence of gonads on B-EP plasma levels, as confirmed by decreasing B-EP levels in gonadectomized humans and rats. Headache, which is likely to occur concomitantly with hormonal milieu variations, appeared to be associated with a deficiency in the B-EP system, centrally and peripherally, the lowest values …
18440231	Apoptosis pathways in fungal growth, development and ageing.	lifespan	2008-06-??	Apoptosis is one type of programmed cell death with great importance for development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Unexpectedly, during the past decade, evidence has been obtained for the existence of a basal apoptosis machinery in yeast, as unicellular fungus, and in some filamentous fungi, a group of microorganisms that are neither true unicellular nor true multicellular biological systems but something in between. Here, we review evidence for a role of apoptotic processes in fungal pathogenicity, competitiveness, propagation, ageing and lifespan control.
15270077	Mild heat stress stimulates 20S proteasome and its 11S activator in human fibroblasts undergoing aging in vitro.	aging	2004-03-??	Repeated mild heat shock (RMHS) has been shown to have several beneficial hormetic effects on human skin fibroblast undergoing aging in vitro. Because an age-related decline in proteasome activity is 1 of the reasons for the accumulation of abnormal proteins during aging, we have investigated the effects of RMHS on the 20S proteasome, which is the major proteolytic system involved in the removal of abnormal and oxidatively damaged proteins. Serially passaged human skin fibroblasts exposed to RMHS at 41 degrees C for 60 minutes twice a week had increased 3 proteasomal activities by 40% to 95% in early- and midpassage cultures. RMHS-treated cells also contained a 2-fold higher amount of the proteasome activator 11S, and the extent of the bound activator was double in early- and midpassage cells only. Furthermore, there was no difference in the content of the 19S proteasome regulator in the stressed and the unstressed cells. Therefore, RMHS-induced proteasome stimulation in early- and mid…
24930376	PTK2 rs7460 and rs7843014 polymorphisms and exceptional longevity: a functional replication study.	longevity, aging	2014-10-??	Focal adhesion is critical for cell survival. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK, or PTK2) is an important component of the human interactome and thus is a potential longevity-related protein. Here we studied the association between two PTK2 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7843014, rs7460) and exceptional longevity (EL). In addition to gaining insight into their functionality by determining luciferase gene reporter activity, we studied the genotype/allele frequency of these two SNPs among three different cohorts: (1) Spanish centenarians (n=175, 100-111 years, 144 women) and healthy controls (n=355, 20-50 years, 284 women); (2) Italian centenarians (n=79, 100-104 years, 40 women) and controls (n=316, 29-50 years, 156 women); and (3) Japanese centenarians (n=742, 100-116 years, 623 women) and healthy controls (n=499, 23-59 years, 356 women). Both SNPs had functional significance, with the A allele up-regulating luciferase activity compared to the other allele (rs7460 T allele…
30806228	Cultural and Metabolomic Studies of a New Phtalides Producer, Lignomyces vetlinianus (Agaricomycetes).	aging	2018-??-??	Culture characteristics and metabolomic profiling (on the basis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of 3 strains of Lignomyces vetlinianus were studied. Growth rate, macromorphology, and micromorphology of mycelia grown on various media are described. More than 60 compounds were detected in the mycelial extracts, including amino acids, organic acids that are active during the tricarboxylic acid cycle, sugars, fatty acids, sugar alcohols, and sugar acids. Principal component analysis of low-molecular-weight compounds in mycelial methanol extracts of L. vetlinianus strains at different stages of growth demonstrated that the pattern of mycelial metabolomes grouped by age of the culture indicates a significant relation between the development of the culture and the specificity of its metabolite spectrum. Slow-growing cultures develop gradually and are characterized by several changes in metabolite states. The pattern of points is grouped more tightly for fast-growing strains. The prod…
9430401	Involvement of lipid peroxidation in platelet signalling.	aging	1997-10-??	A well-known signalling pathway in blood platelets consists in the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids and its specific oxygenation into bioactive derivatives. In particular, cyclic prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane A2 are potent inducers of platelet functions and are produced in greater amounts when the level of lipid hydroperoxides is higher than normal, as 'physiological concentrations' of such peroxides activate the cyclooxygenation of AA. In this context, a lower activity of platelet glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the key-enzyme for the degradation of lipid hydroperoxides, has been reported in aging, which will ensure a longer life span to those peroxides. Accordingly, the biosynthesis of pro-aggregatory prostanoids is elevated in platelets from the elderly. On the other hand, fatty acids from marine origin have been recognized as inhibitors of platelet functions, and they may alter the redox status of cells. They may for instance increase the pla…
4083161	Protein synthetic fidelity in aging human fibroblasts.	aging	1985-??-??	The fidelity of protein synthesis was measured in human diploid skin fibroblasts as a function of passage level ("aging in vitro") and physiological age of tissue donor ("aging in vivo") using two different test systems. First, in cell-free extracts the ratio of delta leu/delta phe incorporation into peptide linkage following in the latter case using cells derived from elderly normal donors and from subjects with the premature aging disorders of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria and the Werner syndrome. Similar results were obtained using a second system of intact cells whereby histidine starvation induces quantifiable satellite spots resolved by two dimensional electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels on the acidic side of the native actin species due to substitution of the neutral amino acid glutamine for the basic histidine. In fact, error frequencies appeared to decrease during aging in vitro, likely due to selection for clonal subpopulations with the highest fidelity of protein synthesis.…
6304145	Increase in serum bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein with aging in women. Implications for the mechanism of age-related bone loss.	aging	1983-05-??	Because it is unclear whether age-related bone loss results from increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation or both, we measured the serum level of bone Gla-protein (BGP), a specific marker for bone turnover, in 174 women, ages 30 to 94 yr. Serum BGP increased linearly with aging (r = 0.44, P less than 0.001) from 4.4 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SE) in the 4th decade to 8.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml in the 10th decade. This increase correlated inversely (P less than 0.001) with concomitant decreases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, midradius, and distal radius. Using partial correlation coefficients, serum BGP still correlated positively with age (r = 0.31, P less than 0.001) after creatinine clearance was fixed but not with creatinine clearance (r = -0.04, NS) when age was fixed. Urinary hydroxyproline (r = 0.29, P less than 0.001), an index of bone resorption, and serum alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.31, P less than 0.001), an index of bone formation, also increased with age and these in…
16494940	Expansion and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells on a vitamin C functionalized polymer.	aging	2006-06-??	In human body ascorbic acid plays an essential role in the synthesis and function of skeletal tissues and immune system factors. Ascorbic acid is also a major physiological antioxidant, repairing oxidatively damaged biomolecules, preventing the formation of excessive reactive oxygen species or scavenging these species. We recently reported the synthesis of ascorbic acid-functionalized polymers in which the antioxidant features of the pendant ascorbic acid groups was preserved. In the present work we demonstrate that ascorbic acid-functionalized poly(methyl methacrylate) (AA-PMMA) can modulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of early and late-passage bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The covalently coupled ascorbic acid impacted MSCs differently than when ascorbic acid was presented to the cells in soluble form. At optimal concentration, the covalently coupled ascorbic acid and soluble ascorbic acid synergistically promoted and retained the abilit…
18556942	Light scatter on the surface of AcrySof intraocular lenses: part II. Analysis of lenses following hydrolytic stability testing.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the surface light scatter and optical quality of AcrySof lenses (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) following simulated aging of 20 years.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: AcrySof lenses were exposed to exaggerated thermal conditions to simulate up to 20 years of aging and were tested for surface light scatter and optical quality (modulation transfer function).    RESULTS: There were no significant differences from baseline for either the surface light scatter or optical quality of the lenses over time.    CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that surface light scatter on AcrySof lenses did not increase under conditions simulating 20 years of aging. Because the simulated aging environment contained no protein, this work indirectly supports the finding that surface light scatter is due to the deposition of a biomaterial on the lens surface rather than changes in the material. Optical performance integrity of the test lenses was maintained u…
23573066	Possibility of leg muscle hypertrophy by ambulation in older adults: a brief review.	aging	2013-??-??	It is known that ambulatory exercises such as brisk walking and jogging are potent stimuli for improving aerobic capacity, but it is less understood whether ambulatory exercise can increase leg muscle size and function. The purpose of this brief review is to discuss whether or not ambulatory exercise elicits leg muscle hypertrophy in older adults. Daily ambulatory activity with moderate (>3 metabolic equivalents [METs], which is defined as the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate) intensity estimated by accelerometer is positively correlated with lower body muscle size and function in older adults. Although there is conflicting data on the effects of short-term training, it is possible that relatively long periods of walking, jogging, or intermittent running for over half a year can increase leg muscle size among older adults. In addition, slow-walk training with a combination of leg muscle blood flow restriction elicits muscle hypertrophy only in the blood fl…
19698732	A functional EXO1 promoter variant is associated with prolonged life expectancy in centenarians.	longevity, aging	2009-10-??	Human longevity is heritable with a genetic component of 25-32%. Variation in genes regulating the levels of somatic maintenance and DNA repair functions is thought to modulate the aging process and to contribute to survival at advanced age. We tested 92 non-synonymous SNPs in 49 DNA repair genes for a possible association with longevity in a sample of 395 German centenarians and 411 controls. The obtained association signal in exonuclease 1 (EXO1) was further investigated by fine mapping and mutation detection, leading to the identification of the functionally relevant SNP rs1776180. Our detailed analyses revealed that the C allele of this promoter SNP is significantly enriched in female centenarians. This finding replicated in 455 female French centenarians and 109 controls. The C allele leads to the loss of a binding site for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E47, resulting in higher EXO1 expression. Thus, we have detected a hitherto undescribed role for E47 as a negat…
19418115	Cold face test in persons with spinal cord injury: age versus inactivity.	aging	2009-08-??	INTRODUCTION: Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) reflect a model of precocious aging and inactivity; as such, these individuals manifest well-appreciated cardiovascular abnormalities. We aimed to determine the influence of inactivity in persons with SCI, and the influence of age in healthy controls, on cardiovascular autonomic responses to the cold face test (CFT).    METHODS: Subjects recruited (n = 42) included 18 controls: 10 young (25 +/- 2 years) and 8 old (50 +/- 6 years), and 24 subjects with chronic SCI: 17 with tetraplegia (C3-C8 44 +/- 7 years) and 7 with paraplegia (T5-T10 36 +/- 8 years). Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure were collected continuously: 2-min pre-CFT, 1-min CFT and 2-min post-CFT. Time-frequency (wavelet) analysis of HR (HFln) was used as an estimate of vagal cardiac modulation.    RESULTS: The HR response to the CFT differed significantly among the SCI group (4.1 +/- 8.8 bpm) and the young (-7.7 +/- 5.9 bpm; P \ 0.001) and old (-6.8 +/- 10.7 bpm; P \ 0.01…
16530029	Inhibition of osteoblast differentiation but not adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by sera obtained from aged females.	aging	2006-07-??	Aging is associated with decreased osteoblast-mediated bone formation leading to bone loss and increased risk for osteoporotic fractures. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for impaired osteoblast functions are poorly understood. In the present study, we hypothesized that changes in bone microenvironment composition with aging are responsible for impaired osteoprogenitor cell recruitment and differentiation. As a model for bone microenvironment, we examined the effects of sera obtained from young (age 20-30 year old [yo], n=20) and old (70-84 yo, n=19) healthy female donors on cell proliferation and differentiation capacity into osteoblasts and adipocytes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Cell proliferation rate determined by counting cell number was similar when the cells were cultured in the presence of media containing 5% sera from old or from young donors. Similarly, the number of adipocytes and levels of adipocytic gene expression was similar in cultures incubated …
22228250	Calciotropic hormones and the risk of hip and nonspine fractures in older adults: the Health ABC Study.	aging	2012-05-??	The effects of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels on incident fracture remain uncertain. To test the hypothesis that increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and decreasing PTH levels are associated with decreased risk of hip and any nonspine fracture, we conducted a prospective cohort study among 2614 community-dwelling white and black participants, aged ≥70 years, from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. Serum and plasma samples were drawn at year 2, which formed the baseline for this analysis. Serum 25(OH)D and intact PTH (1-84) were measured using radioimmunoassay with DiaSorin reagents and EDTA plasma with a two-site immunoradiometric assay kit, respectively. Incident fractures (hip and any nonspine) were assessed after year 2, every 6 months, by self-report and validated by radiology reports. The median (interquartile range) follow-up times for hip and any nonspine fractures were 6.4 (6.1-6.5) and 6.4 (5.5-6.5) years, respectively. Cox pro…
18274564	Oxidative stress in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia.	aging	????-??-??	Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is a common health problem in aging male. Free radicals and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are produced in overwhelming quantity with advancement of age. When in oxidative stress, these reactive species cause extensive damage to various organ in the body, may be associated with pathogenesis of BPH also. This study aimed at assessing Malondialdehyde (MDA), the marker of lipid peroxidation and anti-oxidants e.g. alpha-Tocopherol and Ascorbate status in plasma in BPH patients. Forty eight (n=48) cases of BPH and forty six (n = 46) healthy age matched controls were enrolled. Plasma MDA level showed 4.81+/-1.87 nmol/ml in cases compared to 3.69+/-1.56 nmol/ml in healthy controls (p<0.001). There were significant decrease in plasma alpha-Tocopherol and ascorbate level which were 0.85+/-0.12 mg/dl and 0.93 +/- 0.13 mg/dl in cases compared to 1.37+/-0.31 mg/dl and 1.44+/-0.38 mg/dl in healthy controls respectively. Inverse correlation of plasma MDA with alpha-T…
24242673	Association study of promoter polymorphisms in the CETP gene with longevity in the Han Chinese population.	longevity	2014-01-??	The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is involved in the regulation of reverse cholesterol transport and metabolism of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, has been proposed as a candidate gene for human longevity. SNPs in the promoter region of the CETP gene is likely important in regulation of the expression of the CETP gene. To explore the potential effects of the promoter polymorphisms in the CETP gene on longevity, we investigated the promoter polymorphisms in a sample of long-lived (≥ 90 years old) Han Chinese collected from Southwestern China (N = 380). By resequencing 934 bp of the promoter region, genotypes of four SNPs (-573A/G, -629A/C, -971A/G, -1046T/C) were examined in this sample. However, no association could be confirmed between longevity and these SNPs or haplotypes inferred from them. A novel rare variant -573A/G was found and was found in heterozygote state only in five persons in the Longevity group. But it was not statistically significant (p = 0.0…
15123757	Effect of DHEAS on skeletal muscle over the life span: the InCHIANTI study.	aging	2004-05-??	BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the reduced production of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) may be partially responsible for the decline of muscle strength and mass that often occurs with aging. However, this hypothesis has been only tested in small series of normal volunteers, with little consideration for potential confounders. Using data from a representative sample of 558 men (20-95 years) we tested the hypothesis that circulating DHEAS is independently associated with muscle strength and mass.    METHODS: Data are from InCHIANTI, an epidemiological study conducted in the Chianti geographic area (Tuscany, Italy). DHEAS serum levels were related to lower extremity muscle strength assessed by hand-held dynamometry and calf muscle area estimated from quantitative computerized tomography. Confounders included age, anthropometrics, physical activity, smoking, energy and alcohol intake, albumin, lipids, interleukin-6, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability in activi…
22115178	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor polymorphism rs2229765 and circulating interleukin-6 level affect male longevity in a population-based prospective study (Treviso Longeva--TRELONG).	longevity, lifespan	2011-12-??	Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling modulation has been associated with increased lifespan in model organisms, while high levels of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) are a marker of disability and mortality. In the prospective, population-based "Treviso Longeva"--TRELONG Study from Italy (n = 668, age range 70-105.5 years at baseline, followed for seven years) we investigated the effects of survival on the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) gene polymorphism rs2229765, the IL-6 gene promoter polymorphism rs1800795, and plasma concentrations of IGF-1 and IL-6, alone or in combination. We found a sex-dependent effect for the IGF-1R rs2229765 polymorphism, as male carriers of the homozygous A/A genotype survived longer, while the IL-6 rs1800795 genotype did not influence overall or sex-specific longevity. Higher IL-6 levels were more detrimental for survival among males than females, while IGF-1 had no dose-response effect. These findings sustain the hypothesis that sex-specific longevity …
25913413	FOXO3 variants are beneficial for longevity in Southern Chinese living in the Red River Basin: A case-control study and meta-analysis.	longevity	2015-04-27	Forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors play a crucial role in longevity across species. Several polymorphisms in FOXO3 were previously reported to be associated with human longevity. However, only one Chinese replication study has been performed so far. To verify the role of FOXO3 in southern Chinese in the Red River Basin, a community-based case-control study was conducted, and seven polymorphisms were genotyped in 1336 participants, followed by a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies that included 5327 longevity cases and 4608 controls. In our case-control study, we found rs2802288*A and rs2802292*G were beneficial to longevity after Bonferroni correction (pallele = 0.005, OR = 1.266; pallele = 0.026, OR = 1.207). In addition, in the longevity group, carriers with rs2802288*A and rs2802292*G presented reduced HbA1c (p = 0.001), and homozygotes of rs2802292*GG presented improved HOMA-IR (p = 0.014). The meta-analysis further revealed the overall contribution of rs2802…
3878917	Interleukin-2 production and activity in aged humans.	aging	1985-11-??	Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from aged humans were found impaired in their ability to mount T mitogen induced proliferative responses and NK cell activity. The production of IL-2 in response to PHA has also been found decreased in the aged subjects. When the data from IL-2 production and cellular responsiveness of aged and young groups were pooled for regression analysis, a significant correlation was found both for mitogenic responses and NK activity. The reduced proliferative responses and NK cell activity can be enhanced by exposing them to exogenous IL-2. However, they were not fully reconstituted to the levels achieved in PBMC of the young subjects supplemented in vitro with IL-2. This would indicate that the reduced cellular responsiveness in aging may be related both to a defect of IL-2 receptor expression on T cells of aged subjects and to an impairment in the endogenous IL-2 synthesis in the aged individuals.
16140085	Relationship between serum sex steroids and Aging Male Symptoms score and International Index of Erectile Function.	aging	2005-09-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between the total and subscale scores of the Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires, age, and serum sex steroids levels.    METHODS: A total of 348 patients enrolled in the study answered the AMS and IIEF questionnaires. Hormonal analysis, including total testosterone, free testosterone (FT), estradiol (E2), and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) measurement, were performed. The patients with a total AMS score of 29 were considered to have aging male symptoms and the patients with an IIEF score of less than 26 were considered to have sexual dysfunction.    RESULTS: Although DHEA-S levels were significantly lower and E2 levels were greater in the men with aging male symptoms according to the AMS, the DHEA-S and FT levels were significantly lower in the men with sexual dysfunction, as determined by the IIEF score. Serum DHEA-S and FT levels and age correlated significantly with the IIEF …
24381713	Senescence-related changes in gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from octo/nonagenarians compared to their offspring.	aging	2013-??-??	Mechanisms determining both functional rate of decline and the time of onset in aging remain elusive. Studies of the aging process especially those involving the comparison of long-lived individuals and young controls are fairly limited. Therefore, this research aims to determine the differential gene expression profile in related individuals from villages in Pahang, Malaysia. Genome-wide microarray analysis of 18 samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two groups: octo/nonagenarians (80-99 years old) and their offspring (50.2 ± 4.0 years old) revealed that 477 transcripts were age-induced and 335 transcripts were age-repressed with fold changes ≥1.2 in octo/nonagenarians compared to offspring. Interestingly, changes in gene expression were associated with increased capacity for apoptosis (BAK1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN1B), metabolic process (LRPAP1), insulin action (IGF2R), and increased immune and inflammatory response (IL27RA), whereas response to stress (HSPA…
19254939	Confronting challenges in intervention research with ethnically diverse older adults: the USC Well Elderly II Trial.	aging	2009-02-??	BACKGROUND: Community-dwelling older adults are at risk for declines in physical health, cognition, and psychosocial well-being. However, their enactment of active and health-promoting lifestyles can reduce such declines.    PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the USC Well Elderly II study, a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program for elders, and document how various methodological challenges were addressed during the course of the trial.    METHODS: In the study, 460 ethnically diverse elders recruited from a variety of sites in the urban Los Angeles area were enrolled in a randomized experiment involving a crossover design component. Within either the first or second 6-month phase of their study involvement, each elder received a lifestyle intervention designed to improve a variety of aging outcomes. At 4-5 time points over an 18-24 month interval, the research participants were assessed on measures of healthy activ…
20102351	Protein modification and replicative senescence of WI-38 human embryonic fibroblasts.	aging	2010-04-??	Oxidized proteins as well as proteins modified by the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and by glycation (AGE) have been shown to accumulate with aging in vivo and during replicative senescence in vitro. To better understand the mechanisms by which these damaged proteins build up and potentially affect cellular function during replicative senescence of WI-38 fibroblasts, proteins targeted by these modifications have been identified using a bidimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomic approach coupled with immunodetection of HNE-, AGE-modified and carbonylated proteins. Thirty-seven proteins targeted for either one of these modifications were identified by mass spectrometry and are involved in different cellular functions such as protein quality control, energy metabolism and cytoskeleton. Almost half of the identified proteins were found to be mitochondrial, which reflects a preferential accumulation of damaged proteins within the mitochondria during cellular se…
19480991	Cholinergic modulation of visual working memory during aging: a parametric PET study.	aging	2009-06-30	Age-related differences in the regional recruitment of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive tasks suggests that aging is associated with functional reorganization. Cholinergic enhancement with physostigmine reduces activity in the PFC regions selectively recruited during working memory (WM) and increases activity in visual processing areas, suggesting that augmenting cholinergic function reduces task effort by improving the visual representation of WM stimuli. Here, we investigated how cholinergic enhancement influenced PFC and visual cortical activity in young and older subjects as WM difficulty was altered. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H(2)(15)O-PET in 10 young and 10 older volunteers during a parametrically varied face WM task, following an i.v. infusion of saline and physostigmine. Reaction time decreased during physostigmine relative to placebo in both groups. Prefrontal brain regions selectively recruited in each age group that responded differential…
3771651	Changes of serum-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine content during aging of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1986-11-??	The roles of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17) and polyamines in cellular aging were investigated by examining serum-induced changes of these parameters in quiescent IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts as a function of their population doubling level (PDL) and in human progeria fibroblasts. Serum stimulation caused increases of ODC and DNA synthesis in IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts, with maximal values occurring, respectively, 10 hr and 22 hr after serum stimulation. Both serum-induced ODC activity and DNA synthesis in IMR-90 cells were found to be inversely related to their PDL. Maximal ODC activity and DNA synthesis in young cells (PDL = approximately 18-22) were, respectively, five-fold and six-fold greater than that in old cells (PDL = approximately 50-55), which in turn were comparable or slightly higher than that in progeria fibroblasts. Polyamine contents (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in quiescent IMR-90 cells did not show significant PDL-dependency. The putres…
21709173	Cognitive and neural effects of semantic encoding strategy training in older adults.	aging	2012-04-??	Prior research suggests that older adults are less likely than young adults to use effective learning strategies during intentional encoding. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated whether training older adults to use semantic encoding strategies can increase their self-initiated use of these strategies and improve their recognition memory. The effects of training on older adults' brain activity during intentional encoding were also examined. Training increased older adults' self-initiated semantic encoding strategy use and eliminated pretraining age differences in recognition memory following intentional encoding. Training also increased older adults' brain activity in the medial superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left caudate during intentional encoding. In addition, older adults' training-related changes in recognition memory were strongly correlated with training-related changes in brain activity in prefrontal and left lateral temporal…
29687354	Swallow Event Sequencing: Comparing Healthy Older and Younger Adults.	aging	2018-??-??	Previous research has established that a great deal of variation exists in the temporal sequence of swallowing events for healthy adults. Yet, the impact of aging on swallow event sequence is not well understood. Kendall et al. (Dysphagia 18(2):85-91, 2003) suggested there are 4 obligatory paired-event sequences in swallowing. We directly compared adherence to these sequences, as well as event latencies, and quantified the percentage of unique sequences in two samples of healthy adults: young (< 45) and old (> 65). The 8 swallowing events that contribute to the sequences were reliably identified from videofluoroscopy in a sample of 23 healthy seniors (10 male, mean age 74.7) and 20 healthy young adults (10 male, mean age 31.5) with no evidence of penetration-aspiration or post-swallow residue. Chi-square analyses compared the proportions of obligatory pairs and unique sequences by age group. Compared to the older subjects, younger subjects had significantly lower adherence to two oblig…
6467965	Lipids of human lens fiber cell membranes.	aging	1984-07-??	A study of the membranes of human lens fiber cells revealed a very high protein to lipid ratio, which tended to increase with aging and in brunescent cataract. Phospholipids were more abundant than cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and other neutral lipids. With aging and cataract formation, a marked decrease in membranes phospholipid content occurred. Sphingomyelin was present in highest amount. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol were also present. Cholesterol represented approximately 40% of the total lipids. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having 16 to 24 carbons were present. The lipid composition varied according to the portion of the lens examined and the state of the lens. The results do not support a conclusion that lipid peroxidation represents a major mechanism of membrane damage that contributes to cataract formation, since there is no decrease in unsaturated fatty acids with age or …
6881176	Differential changes of autonomic nervous system function with age in man.	aging	1983-08-??	To assess the relationship between aging and autonomic nervous system function, cardiovascular and pupillary autonomic nervous system reflexes were measured in subgroups of 103 normal male subjects ranging in age from 19 to 82 years (mean age = 39 years). Both the plasma norepinephrine level, a measure of cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system activity, and the mean arterial blood pressure increased with age (r = 0.68 and 0.67, respectively, both p less than 0.001). In contrast, the plasma epinephrine level, a measure of adrenomedullary sympathetic nervous system activity, was unrelated to age (r = 0.08, p = NS). Respiratory variation of heart rate during beta-adrenergic blockade, an index of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity, was reduced in older subjects (r = -0.54, p less than 0.001). Thus, there was evidence of an age-related increase of cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system activity and a reduction of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity. These find…
7160623	Modifications of phosphoproteins and protein kinases occurring with in vitro aging of cultured human cells.	aging	????-??-??	We have studied the age-related modifications of endogenous phosphorylations and protein kinases in seven different strains of cultured human cells (two fibroblastic and five human liver-derived strains). Endogenous phosphorylation of phosphopeptides by cells incubated in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate constantly changed with aging; these modifications could not be explained only by loss of replicative capacity of these cells. Total casein and phosvitin kinase activity did not change in the course of in vitro cell aging. Gel filtration chromatography and autophosphorylation of partially purified kinase preparations, however, seemed to indicate some age-related modifications of protein kinases. Electrophoresis of active enzymes demonstrated that some histone/protamine kinases decreased with aging while a new 3':5'-cyclic AMP-independent histone kinase band appeared progressively. It is proposed that new protein kinase isozymes could correspond to new genes progressively activated d…
7440637	Fidelity of protein synthesis does not decline during aging of cultured human fibroblasts.	aging	1980-05-??	To ascertain whether the fidelity of protein synthesis declines during cellular aging in vitro, we have developed a cell-free protein synthesizing system from cultured human fibroblasts which actively incorporates phenylalanine into acid-insoluble material upon addition of poly (U). The accuracy of poly (U)-directed protein synthesis was determined by comparing the ratio of leucine to phenylalanine incorporation in extracts of early- and late-passage fibroblasts derived from normal persons and from subjects with two genetic disorders of premature aging, progeria, and Werner syndrome. The results show no decline in translational fidelity at late passage or in prematurely aging cells, and thus fail to support the error catastrophe theory of cellular aging.
854916	Changes of hypophysio-ovarian endocrinological function by aging in woman.	aging	1977-03-??	Serum estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH were concomitantly measured by radioimmunoassay in pre- and post-menopausal women in an attempt to study hormonal changes occurring in menopause. The level of serum estradiol in post-menopausal women was maintained at the same level as in pre-menopausal stage within one year after menopause and thereafter began to decrease to the senile minimal level. On the other hand, the mean serum levels of FSH and LH were elevated gradually after menopause. At the conclusion of this study, it was suggested that the key point of the mechanism of menopause may exist not only in the depletion of ovarian function but in the change of the regulatory mechanism of LH and FSH secretion by aging.
25307612	Can enhanced autophagy be associated with human longevity? Serum levels of the autophagy biomarker beclin-1 are increased in healthy centenarians.	longevity	2014-12-??	Autophagy is a major clearance mechanism that degrades organelles and large protein aggregates to maintain cell survival and protein homeostasis. Although induction of autophagy can promote longevity in experimental models, the question as to whether increased basal levels of autophagy can be associated with human longevity remains open. In this pilot study, we investigated the association between serum concentrations of beclin-1, a key regulator of autophagy, and human exceptional longevity (EL). Serum beclin-1 was measured in three study groups: 79 healthy centenarians (39 males, aged 100-104 years); 178 non-diabetic patients who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction at a young age (101 males, 28-39 years); and 180 age- and sex-matched healthy young volunteers (103 males, 27-39 years) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Healthy centenarians had significantly higher beclin-1 levels (2.2±0.8 ng/mL) compared with both young patients with myocardial infarction (1.5±0.7 n…
6940198	Effect of chronologic age on induction of cystathionine synthase, uroporphyrinogen I synthase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in lymphocytes.	aging	1981-03-??	The activities of cystathionine synthase [L-serine hydro-lyase (adding homocysteine), EC 4.2.1.22], uroporphyrinogen I synthase [porphobilinogen ammonia-lyase (polymerizing), EC 4.3.1.8], and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) have been measured in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of young and old human subjects. A significant decrease in activity with age was observed for cystathionine synthase and uroporphyrinogen I synthase but not for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. These changes could not be related to declining phytohemagglutinin response with aging. Age-related decreases in activity of some enzymes may be relevant for an understanding of the biology of aging. False assignment of heterozygosity, and even homozygosity, for certain genetic disorders, such as homocystinuria, may result when low enzyme levels are detected in the lymphocytes of older people.
11787061	Differential maintenance and de novo methylating activity by three DNA methyltransferases in aging and immortalized fibroblasts.	aging	2002-??-??	Genomic methylation, which influences many cellular processes such as gene expression and chromatin organization, generally declines with cellular senescence although some genes undergo paradoxical hypermethylation during cellular aging and immortalization. To explore potential mechanisms for this process, we analyzed the methylating activity of three DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in aging and immortalized WI-38 fibroblasts. Overall maintenance methylating activity by the Dnmts greatly decreased during cellular senescence. In immortalized WI-38 cells, maintenance methylating activity was similar to that of normal young cells. Combined de novo methylation activity of the Dnmts initially decreased but later increased as WI-38 cells aged and was strikingly elevated in immortalized cells. To further elucidate the mechanisms for changes in DNA methylation in aging and immortalized cells, the individual Dnmts were separated and individually assessed for maintenance and de novo methylating a…
24962132	Oxidative stress is related to frailty, not to age or sex, in a geriatric population: lipid and protein oxidation as biomarkers of frailty.	aging	2014-07-??	OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether indicators of oxidative damage to lipids (malondialdehyde (MDA)) and proteins (protein carbonylation) are biomarkers of frailty, after adjusting for age, sex, and other possible confounders.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.    SETTING: Community.    PARTICIPANTS: Toledo Study for Healthy Aging participants (N = 742, aged 65-95), classified as frail (n = 54), prefrail (n = 278) and nonfrail (n = 410) according to the Fried criteria.    MEASUREMENTS: Blood plasma was obtained using centrifugation (1,500 G, 15 minutes) and immediately frozen at -80°C. Plasma lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the MDA formed from lipoperoxides using high-performance liquid chromatography and protein carbonylation was measured using Western blot.    RESULTS: Age- and sex-adjusted levels of lipoperoxides (measured as MDA) and protein carbonylation in plasma proved to be related to frailty, even after including possible independent confounders.    CONCLUSIO…
2226662	Red cell aging and active calcium transport.	aging	1990-??-??	The authors have investigated the relationships between the active calcium transport across the human red blood cell (RBC) membrane and the RBC aging processes in vivo and in vitro. For the study of this biological system, the authors have determined the active calcium uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles obtained from selected RBC populations. This model provided an optimal way to assess the biochemical and functional responses of the human cell to the oxidative stimulus triggered by the cellular aging processes. The activity of the calcium pump is indeed strictly correlated to the oxidative damage suffered by the RBC, being higher in the aged RBC. It appears that the main controller of the active calcium transport is the age-dependent protein inhibitor of the calcium pump.
7776985	Changes of the methylation pattern of the c-myc gene during in vitro aging of IMR90 human embryonic fibroblasts.	aging	1995-05-??	DNA modification by cytosine methylation has received considerable interest in the context of mammalian cell differentiation but is discussed controversially with respect to cellular aging. As the expression of c-myc affects strongly cellular aging and terminal differentiation, we have analysed the sequence-specific methylation pattern of the c-myc gene during proliferative aging in vitro of human embryonic fibroblasts. In this study, both, 5-methylcytidine sensitive restriction enzymes as well as genomic sequencing were used. The overall methylation pattern was found essentially stable during proliferative aging. However, specific hypermethylation of exon II during aging was observed. Furthermore, one specific cytidine located in the consensus sequence of the DNA binding factor PEBP2 was found completely methylated during most of the course of proliferative aging of the cells but became demethylated as the cells reached the end of their proliferative life span. Our results indicate th…
7758534	Cellular aging and the importance of energetic factors.	aging	????-??-??	The in vitro aging of human fibroblasts has become a classical model for studying cellular aging. This model was lately redefined by showing that these cells represent a stem cell system in which they progressively pass through seven morphotypes. Experimental data showed that external conditions that can be considered as stresses for the cells, can modulate the genome expression by speeding up the passage of the cells from one morphotype to the other. In this article, we will interpret these observations from the point of view of the thermodynamics of far from equilibrium open systems, which shows the importance of the production and the use of energy, both responsible for the generation of a given amount of entropy production. In stable systems like these cell morphotypes, such a production is constant but external stresses can prematurely destabilize the steady state of entropy production and, in doing so, accelerate the process of aging. It is also predicted that cells submitted to …
6621064	Binding of thyroid hormone by heme proteins may signal protein age.	aging	1983-07-07	Cellular aging is thought to include the accumulation of proteins with post-translational modifications that alter degradation rates or function or both. Protein catabolism has been regarded as a randomly occurring process, but recent observations have suggested mechanisms by which old and young cells may distinguish recently-synthesized protein molecules from "old" proteins. Hemoglobin, myoglobin and other heme proteins bind thyroid hormone progressively with time and in a poorly-dissociable manner. This cumulative acquisition of thyroid hormone is postulated to be an index of molecular aging.
30728018	The effect of China's new cooperative medical scheme on health expenditures among the rural elderly.	longevity, aging	2019-??-06	BACKGROUND: The alarming progression of an increasingly aging population in China has attracted much attention within the country and abroad. In 2003, the Chinese central government launched the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) to resolve problems of healthcare inequity in regions with inadequate infrastructure and relative poverty. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of NCMS on health expenditures by the Chinese rural elderly population.    METHODS: The data were obtained from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), which was conducted in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014. Elderly people living in rural areas and 60 years old or above were screened for the investigation. The sample size was 7472 in 2005, 11,705 in 2008, 9239 in 2011, and 6059 in 2014. The OOP% and reimbursement ratio were the medical expenses paid by individuals accounting for their per capita annual income and the medical expenses paid by medical insurance accounting for their tota…
7462404	Age-related changes of serum 3,3'-diiodothyronine, 3',5'-diiodothyronine, and 3,5-diiodothyronine concentrations in man.	aging	1981-03-??	To evaluate the effects of aging on T4 metabolism, serum 3,3'diiodothyronine (3,3'-T2), 3',5'-diiodothyronine (3',5'-T2), and 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) as well as T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations were determined by RIAs in 81 normal subjects, aged 24-81 yr. 3,3'-T2, 3',5'-T2, and 3,5-T2 antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the protein conjugate of each diiodothyronine. Since the 3',5'-T2 antiserum cross-reacted with rT3 to the extent of 1.8%, correction was made by subtracting 1.8% of the rT3 value from the measured 3',5'-T2 value. The other 2 antisera had no noticeable cross-reactivity with various thyroid hormone derivatives. Although no significant relation existed between T4 levels and age (r = -0.14; P greater than 0.1) serum T3 showed a significant correlation with age (r = -0.28; P less than 0.05). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed between rT3 and age (r = 0.12; P greater than 0.1). Serum 3,3'-T2, 3',5'-Tw, and 3,5-T2 values (nanograms per dl) al…
22670852	Sex differences in cognition in healthy elderly individuals.	aging	2012-11-??	Sex differences in patterns of cognitive test performance have been attributed to factors, such as sex hormones or sexual dimorphisms in brain structure, that change with normal aging. The current study examined sex differences in patterns of cognitive test performance in healthy elderly individuals. Cognitive test scores of 957 men and women (age 67-89), matched for overall level of cognitive test performance, age, education, and depression scale score, were compared. Men and women were indistinguishable on tests of auditory divided attention, category fluency, and executive functioning. In contrast, women performed better than men on tests of psychomotor speed and verbal learning and memory, whereas men outperformed women on tests of visuoconstruction and visual perception. Our finding that the pattern of sex differences in cognition observed in young adults is observed in old age has implications for future studies of both healthy elderly individuals and of those with cognitive diso…
20561513	Modifications of band 3 and oxidation level of membrane proteins in senescent erythrocytes.	lifespan	2010-09-??	OBJECTIVES: To study membrane proteins modifications in Senescent Red Blood Cells (SeRBC). DESIGN ANDMETHODS: SeRBC were obtained on Percoll gradients. Membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, band 3 by immunoblotting, and protein oxidation by measuring the carbonyl groups.    RESULTS: Densitometric analysis showed no change in SeRBC while an increase in band 3 and its degradation products was found. An increase of protein oxidation level was found in SeRBC.    CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further experimental evidence about protein modifications occurring during the RBC lifespan.
18614670	Training-induced brain structure changes in the elderly.	aging	2008-07-09	It has been suggested that learning is associated with a transient and highly selective increase in brain gray matter in healthy young volunteers. It is not clear whether and to what extent the aging brain is still able to exhibit such structural plasticity. We built on our original study, now focusing on healthy senior citizens. We observed that elderly persons were able to learn three-ball cascade juggling, but with less proficiency compared with 20-year-old adolescents. Similar to the young group, gray-matter changes in the older brain related to skill acquisition were observed in area hMT/V5 (middle temporal area of the visual cortex). In addition, elderly volunteers who learned to juggle showed transient increases in gray matter in the hippocampus on the left side and in the nucleus accumbens bilaterally.
8900615	Self-help and help-seeking behavior patterns in healthy elders.	aging	1996-09-??	The challenges and losses that accompany aging may alter task performance and self-care ability. However, resourceful elders maintain independence in daily tasks despite adverse situations. Resourcefulness consists of self-help strategies for coping with adversity. Elders may also seek help from others when faced by challenges or losses. This study examines self-help and help-seeking behaviors in relation to depressive cognitions, adaptive functioning, and life satisfaction among 120 healthy elders. Self-help was significantly correlated with the absence of depressive cognitions and with higher adaptive functioning, but help-seeking was not. Both self-help and help-seeking were significantly correlated with greater life satisfaction. However, self-help and help-seeking were not associated. The findings suggest that healthy elders may benefit from interventions that facilitate self-help and those that teach them to seek outside help. Future research should examine self-help and help-see…
15617865	Placental defence is considered sufficient to control lipid peroxidation in pregnancy.	aging	2005-??-??	Oxidative stress is characterized by an overweight of pro-oxidants against antioxidant forces and is associated with atherosclerosis, aging, and reproductive complications. Placenta is the major source of pro-oxidant agents, antioxidant enzyme-systems, and hormones and is able to keep the lipid peroxidation under control in normal pregnancy. As oxidation processes are increased in pregnancy, we would expect a shortening of lag phase of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-oxidation. LDL oxidation assessed by measuring conjugated diene formation is a marker for the early part of lipid peroxidation process and the balance of pro-oxidants and antioxidants influences length of lag phase. Our results show that resistance of LDL oxidation is unchanged during normal pregnancy in the second and third trimester. Only antioxidants are able to protect LDL. Estriol is an antioxidant, increases the lag-phase of LDL-oxidation in vitro, and its serum concentration raises enormous during late pregnancy. Thus…
6946268	Prostaglandin production and cellular aging.	aging	1981-??-??	Prostaglandin (PG) production by human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELF) is stimulated by a number of effectors including angiotensin, thrombin, bradykinin and ascorbic acid. The types of prostaglandins produced are to a degree effector-dependent. For example, angiotensin stimulates mainly PGE2 synthesis, thrombin stimulates production of both PGE2 and prostacyclin while bradykinin and ascorbic acid stimulate production of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, prostacyclin and thromboxane A2. Upon senescence in culture, prostacyclin (PGI2) production by HELF drops dramatically in response to ascorbic or arachidonic acids. An overall drop in prostaglandin synthesis is observed with bradykinin stimulation. Prostaglandin production is also related to senescence in human skin fibroblasts (HSF). These cells produce predominantly PGI2. Prostacyclin production in response to bradykinin drops in HSF as they are obtained from individuals of increasing chronologic age. Thus our results indicate changes in prostaglandi…
10417247	Comparison of impaired subcortico-frontal metabolic networks in normal aging, subcortico-frontal dementia, and cortical frontal dementia.	aging	1999-08-??	Normal aging, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are characterized by different degrees of decline in frontal lobe functions. We used (18)FDG-PET and statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) to compare relative subcorticofrontal metabolic impairment at rest in 21 healthy elderly subjects (HES), 20 PSP patients, and 6 FTD patients. When HES were compared to 22 healthy young subjects, widespread decrease in metabolism was observed in bilateral medial prefrontal areas including anterior cingulate cortices, in dorsolateral prefrontal areas, in left lateral premotor area, in Broca's area, and in left insula. In PSP compared to the 43 healthy subjects (HS), we observed subcorticofrontal metabolic impairment including both motor and cognitive neural networks. Impairment of functional connections between midbrain tegmentum and cerebellar, temporal and pallidal regions was demonstrated in PSP as compared to HS. When comparing FTD to HS, glucose uptake was prim…
12795634	Challenges and solutions for care of frail older adults.	aging	2003-??-??	Frail older adults are at risk for negative outcomes and are the most significant consumers of health resources across both acute and community settings. Both formal systems and families are involved in this care of frail elders. This article reviews health care issues for frail older adults and addresses the impact of frailty on the future health care system. It also presents challenges for future care, creative solutions that are currently being tested and explored, and suggestions for future nursing priorities. Challenges in the care of frail elders include: the organization and sustainability of the continuum of services, resource allocation, and cultural competence in service delivery. Creative solutions include intensive case management programs, targeting at risk older adults, partnerships with families, enhanced use of telemedicine and assistive technology, and promoting healthy aging. Nurses have the potential to improve elder health across settings through clinical practice, …
15972614	Dietary variety predicts low body mass index and inadequate macronutrient and micronutrient intakes in community-dwelling older adults.	aging	2005-05-??	BACKGROUND: Low body mass index (BMI) and micronutrient deficiencies are associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates in old age. Whether adverse patterns of dietary variety predict both low BMI and low micronutrient intakes in older adults was investigated.    METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of national survey data was conducted in 1174 healthy adult men and women (ages 21 to 90 years) who provided physiologically plausible dietary data in the 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. Measurements included reported energy intake, protein intake (percentage meeting Recommended Dietary Allowance), micronutrient intakes (percentage meeting Estimated Average Requirements for 14 micronutrients), and BMI.    RESULTS: Adults who were 61 years or older consumed a greater total variety of foods, chose foods from a wider range of food groups, had a greater variety of micronutrient-dense foods and energy-weak foods, and had a lower variety of micronutrient-weak f…
27589836	The rate of change in declining steroid hormones: a new parameter of healthy aging in men?	aging	2016-??-20	Research on healthy aging in men has increasingly focused on age-related hormonal changes. Testosterone (T) decline is primarily investigated, while age-related changes in other sex steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], estradiol [E2], progesterone [P]) are mostly neglected. An integrated hormone parameter reflecting aging processes in men has yet to be identified. 271 self-reporting healthy men between 40 and 75 provided both psychometric data and saliva samples for hormone analysis. Correlation analysis between age and sex steroids revealed negative associations for the four sex steroids (T, DHEA, E2, and P). Principal component analysis including ten salivary analytes identified a principal component mainly unifying the variance of the four sex steroid hormones. Subsequent principal component analysis including the four sex steroids extracted the principal component of declining steroid hormones (DSH). Moderation analysis of the association between age and DSH revealed significan…
27737853	Brain Network Architecture and Global Intelligence in Children with Focal Epilepsy.	aging	2017-02-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The biologic basis for intelligence rests to a large degree on the capacity for efficient integration of information across the cerebral network. We aimed to measure the relationship between network architecture and intelligence in the pediatric, epileptic brain.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified with the following: 1) focal epilepsy; 2) brain MR imaging at 3T, including resting-state functional MR imaging; and 3) full-scale intelligence quotient measured by a pediatric neuropsychologist. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into approximately 700 gray matter network "nodes." The strength of a connection between 2 nodes was defined by the correlation between their blood oxygen level-dependent time-series. We calculated the following topologic properties: clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity, path length, and global efficiency. A machine learning algorithm was used to measure the independent contribution of each metric …
27746000	Supplementing essential amino acids with the nitric oxide precursor, l-arginine, enhances skeletal muscle perfusion without impacting anabolism in older men.	aging	2017-??-??	Postprandial limb blood flow and skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion reduce with aging. Here we tested the impact of providing bolus essential amino acids (EAA) in the presence and absence of the nitric oxide precursor, l-Arginine (ARG), upon skeletal muscle blood flow and anabolism in older men. Healthy young (YOUNG: 19.7 ± 0.5 y, N = 8) and older men (OLD, 70 ± 0.8 y, N = 8) received 15 g EAA or (older only) 15 g EAA +3 g ARG (OLD-ARG, 69.2 ± 1.2 y, N = 8). We quantified responses in muscle protein synthesis (MPS; incorporation of C phenylalanine into myofibrillar proteins), leg and muscle microvascular blood flow (Doppler/contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)) and insulin/EAA in response to EEA ± ARG. Plasma EAA increased similarly across groups but argininemia was evident solely in OLD-ARG (∼320 mmol, 65 min post feed); increases in plasma insulin (to ∼13 IU ml) were similar across groups. Increases in femoral flow were evident in YOUNG >2 h after feeding; these effects were blun…
9713698	Repeated mild heat shock delays ageing in cultured human skin fibroblasts.	lifespan	1998-07-??	The effects of repetitive mild heat shock (30 min, 41 degrees C) on growth and various cellular and biochemical characteristics of human skin fibroblasts undergoing ageing in vitro were analysed. Human skin cells not only tolerated more than 30 repeated heat shocks throughout their replicative lifespan, but also maintained several characteristics of young cells until late in life. Whereas the growth rates, population doubling rates, and cumulative population doubling levels achieved in vitro remained unaffected, age-related changes in cellular morphology, cell size, cytoskeletal organisation, autofluorescence and neutral beta-galactosidase activity were significantly slowed down by repeated mild heat shock. These hormesis-like effects of stress-induced defence processes can be useful to elucidate the role of maintenance and repair mechanisms in ageing.
18818449	Religious participation and mortality risk among the oldest old in China.	longevity, aging	2008-09-??	OBJECTIVE: Rapid population aging in China calls for more research into social factors responsible for health and well-being among older adults. This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining the relationship between religious participation and mortality, as well as the potential pathways linking these factors and subgroup variations among oldest old Chinese.    METHODS: Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, I estimated Cox proportional hazards models for a nationwide sample of Chinese aged 80 to 105.    RESULT: Controlling for a wide range of covariates, I found religious participation to be significantly associated with lower risk of mortality for oldest old women and for individuals in poor health. Engaging in leisure activities and exercises partially accounted for this association.    DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that (a) religious participation, associated with other socially integrated and cognitively stimulating activities…
17167298	Decreasing prevalence of disability in activities of daily living, functional limitations and poor self-rated health: a 6-year follow-up study in Spain.	aging	2006-10-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Forecasting functional status in elderly populations is uncertain. Our aim is to provide evidence of population trends of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) disability, functional limitations and self-rated health.    METHODS: Data come from a longitudinal study of aging in Leganés (Spain), collected in 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999, on a representative sample of 1560 community dwelling people over 65. Response rate at baseline was 82%. ADL disability was defined as needing help in at least one of the following: walking across a small room, taking a shower, toileting, getting out of bed, getting up from a chair, using the toilet, dressing and eating. Functional limitations were based on questions of difficulty with upper and lower limbs. Self-rated health was assessed with a single question. ADL disability, functional limitations and self-rated health were regressed on age, survey year, sex and education.    RESULTS: There are significant declines in ADL disability, func…
18948555	Cumulative deficits and physiological indices as predictors of mortality and long life.	longevity	2008-10-??	We evaluated the predictive potential for long-term (24-year) survival and longevity (85+ years) of an index of cumulative deficits (DI) and six physiological indices (pulse pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, serum cholesterol, blood glucose, and hematocrit) measured in mid- to late life (44-88 years) for participants of the 9th and 14th Framingham Heart Study examinations. For all ages combined, the DI, pulse pressure, and blood glucose are the strongest determinants of both long-term survival and longevity, contributing cumulatively to their explanation. Diastolic blood pressure and hematocrit are less significant determinants of both of these outcomes. The pulse rate is more relevant to survival, whereas serum cholesterol is more relevant to longevity. Only the DI is a significant predictor of longevity and mortality for each 5-year age group ranging from 45 to 85 years. The DI appears to be a more important determinant of long-term risks of death and longevity than are…
24752386	Construct validity of the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) in healthy older adults.	aging	2014-12-??	The Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) is a clinical measure of prospective memory. There is emerging support for the sensitivity and ecological relevance of the MIST in clinical populations. In the present study, the construct validity of the MIST was evaluated in 40 younger (18-30 years), 24 young-old (60-69 years), and 37 old-old (70+ years) healthy adults. Consistent with expectations derived from the prospective memory and aging literature, older adults demonstrated lower scores on the MIST's primary scale scores (particularly on the time-based scale), but slightly better performance on the seminaturalistic 24-hour trial. Among the healthy older adults, the MIST showed evidence of both convergent (e.g., verbal fluency) and divergent (e.g., visuoperception) correlations with standard clinical tests, although the magnitude of those correlations were comparable across the time- and event-based scales. Together, these results support the discriminant and convergent validity o…
11918707	Photoaging is associated with protein oxidation in human skin in vivo.	aging	2002-04-??	There is increasing evidence for the generation of reactive oxygen species in skin upon ultraviolet exposure, but little is known about their pathophysiologic relevance in human skin in vivo. We hypothesized that chronic and acute photodamage is mediated by depleted antioxidant enzyme expression and increased oxidative protein modifications. Biopsies from patients with histologically confirmed solar elastosis, from non-ultraviolet-exposed sites of age-matched controls, and from young subjects were analyzed. To evaluate the influence of acute ultraviolet exposures, buttock skin of 12 healthy subjects was irradiated repetitively on 10 d with a solar simulator and compared intraindividually to non-ultraviolet-treated contralateral sites. The antioxidant enzymes catalase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, and manganese superoxide dismutase were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Protein carbonyls were analyzed by immunohistochemical and immunoblotting techniques in human skin and in cel…
18345988	A developmental examination of amygdala response to facial expressions.	aging	2008-09-??	Several lines of evidence implicate the amygdala in face-emotion processing, particularly for fearful facial expressions. Related findings suggest that face-emotion processing engages the amygdala within an interconnected circuitry that can be studied using a functional-connectivity approach. Past work also underscores important functional changes in the amygdala during development. Taken together, prior research on amygdala function and development reveals a need for more work examining developmental changes in the amygdala's response to fearful faces and in amygdala functional connectivity during face processing. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare 31 adolescents (9-17 years old) and 30 adults (21-40 years old) on activation to fearful faces in the amygdala and other regions implicated in face processing. Moreover, these data were used to compare patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in adolescents and adults. During passive vi…
3933382	Impaired in vitro testicular endocrine function in elderly men.	aging	????-??-??	Measurements of testosterone concentrations in peripheral and spermatic venous blood have yielded conflicting results concerning testosterone production in elderly men. To further elucidate the testicular endocrine capacity during aging, peripheral serum hormone levels and the in vitro conversion of progesterone and pregnenolone in histopathologically normal testicular tissue have been investigated in 22 elderly men and 28 younger adult males. The conversion mediated by 3 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase was significantly higher (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 respectively) in testicular tissue from the younger adult men, than in testicular tissue from elderly men. Since serum LH levels were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) and serum testosterone levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the elderly men, these data indicate that there was a primary endocrine impairment at the testicular level in the elderly men.
28109710	Univariate predictors of maternal concentrations of environmental chemicals: The MIREC study.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: The developing fetus and pregnant woman can be exposed to a variety of environmental chemicals that may adversely affect their health. Moreover, environmental exposure and risk disparities are associated with different social determinants, including socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic indicators. Our aim was to investigate whether and how maternal concentrations of a large panel of persistent and non-persistent environmental chemicals vary according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics in a large pregnancy and birth cohort.    METHODS: Data were analyzed from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a cohort of pregnant women (N=2001) recruited over four years (2008-2011) in 10 cities across Canada. In all, 1890 urine and 1938 blood samples from the first trimester (1st and 3rd trimester for metals) were analysed and six sociodemographic and lifestyle indicators were assessed: maternal age, household income, parity, smoking …
19717729	Reflex vasoconstriction in aged human skin increasingly relies on Rho kinase-dependent mechanisms during whole body cooling.	aging	2009-11-??	Primary human aging may be associated with augmented Rho kinase (ROCK)-mediated contraction of vascular smooth muscle and ROCK-mediated inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We hypothesized that the contribution of ROCK to reflex vasoconstriction (VC) is greater in aged skin. Cutaneous VC was elicited by 1) whole body cooling [mean skin temperature (T(sk)) = 30.5 degrees C] and 2) local norepinephrine (NE) infusion (1 x 10(-6) M). Four microdialysis fibers were placed in the forearm skin of eight young (Y) and eight older (O) subjects for infusion of 1) Ringer solution (control), 2) 3 mM fasudil (ROCK inhibition), 3) 20 mM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (NOS inhibition), and 4) both ROCK + NOS inhibitors. Red cell flux was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry over each site. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to baseline CVC (%DeltaCVC(baseline)). VC was reduced at the control site in O during cooling (Y, -34 + or -…
28884409	Chronic exposure to rapamycin and episodic serum starvation modulate ageing of human fibroblasts in vitro.	longevity, lifespan	2017-10-??	Mild stress-induced activation of stress response (SR) pathways, such as autophagy, heat shock response, oxidative SR, DNA damage response, and inflammatory response, can be potentially health beneficial. Using the model system of cellular ageing and replicative senescence in vitro, we have studied the ageing modulatory effects of the two conditions, rapamycin and serum starvation. Chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 nM rapamycin positively modulated the survival, growth, morphology, telomere length, DNA methylation levels, 8-oxo-dG level in DNA, N-methyl-adenosine level in RNA, and ethanol stress tolerance of serially passaged normal human skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, episodic (once a week) serum starvation of human skin fibroblasts extended their replicative lifespan by about 22%, along with the maintenance of early passage youthful morphology even in late passage cultures. Although the results of this study may be considered preliminary, it can be inferred that intermittent and epis…
22941032	CYP2D6 genotype affects age-related decline in flecainide clearance: a population pharmacokinetic analysis.	aging	2012-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between age-related decline in flecainide clearance and CYP2D6 genotype, we conducted a population pharmacokinetic analysis of flecainide using routine therapeutic drug monitoring data.    METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on retrospective data from 163 genotyped patients treated with oral flecainide for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The CYP2D6 genotype was categorized as CYP2D6 homozygous extensive metabolizers (hom-EMs; n=57), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (het-EMs; n=79), and intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers (IMs/PMs; n=27).    RESULTS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate, body weight, female sex, and aging were important factors for estimating flecainide clearance. The metabolic clearance was decreased age dependently in a curvilinear fashion, where the lower clearance was observed in greater than 60 years for het-EMs and greater than 55 ye…
30535930	Approaches to Deprescribing Psychotropic Medications for Changed Behaviours in Long-Term Care Residents Living with Dementia.	aging	2019-??-??	Psychotropic medications have a high risk of serious adverse events and small effect size for changed behaviours for people with dementia. Non-pharmacological approaches are recommended as first-line treatment for changed behaviours, yet psychotropic medications remain highly prevalent in long-term aged care settings. This narrative review describes the current evidence regarding deprescribing psychotropic medications for people with dementia in long-term care. Deprescribing psychotropic medications can be achieved without harm to the person with dementia, and most people experience no withdrawal symptoms. Interventions to deprescribe psychotropic medications should be multifactorial, including lowering the dose of the medication over time, educational interventions and psychological support. However, implementing this is a significant challenge due to the overreliance on psychotropic medications for behavioural management in long-term aged care. Facilitators to deprescribing psychotro…
1944860	Mapping the functional neuroanatomy of the intact human brain with brain work imaging.	aging	1991-??-??	The recent development of noninvasive methods for measuring local rates of energy metabolism or blood flow in the brain has made it possible to investigate functional neuroanatomy in healthy human subjects. The best of these methods, high resolution measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography (PET), provides a precision of anatomical localization that far exceeds that attainable with human brain lesion studies. Moreover, the study of healthy subjects avoids possible confounding effects of brain lesions, such as compensatory reorganization of brain function. PET-rCBF studies have already identified several cortical areas involved in higher-order visual processing, indicating that functional neuroimaging may yield a map of human visual cortex analogous to maps that have been developed by vision research in nonhuman primates. PET-rCBF studies of imagery and language demonstrate the potential of functional neuroimaging to map regions of human cortex…
11097112	New polymorphisms in the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 coding sequence: lack of association with longevity or with increased cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity.	longevity	2000-??-??	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) encoded by the PARP-1 gene, is a ubiquitous and abundant DNA-binding protein involved in the cellular response to various genotoxic agents. In a previous study we showed that maximal oligonucleotide-stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was significantly higher in permeabilised lymphoblastoid cell lines from a French population of centenarians compared with controls aged 20-70 years, supporting the notion that longevity is associated with a genetically determined, high poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity. Here, we describe four new genetic polymorphisms, three of which represent silent nucleotide variants (C402T, T1011C, G1215A), and one of which leads to a valine762-to-alanine exchange (T2444C). We undertook an association study between two of these polymorphisms and human longevity or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity in permeabilised lymphoblastoid cells. By analysing 648 DNA samples from a French population (324 centenarians and 324 controls) by fluores…
6981228	Alteration in plasma proteins and platelet functions with aging and cigarette smoking in healthy men.	aging	1982-06-28	Blood samples were obtained on four different occasions from 18 cigarette smoking and 34 non-smoking healthy men (age 40-69) and analyzed to assess age- and smoking-associated changes in plasma proteins, blood coagulation and platelet functions. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was significantly increased with aging in non-smokers. Significant changes in chronic smokers were increases in platelet count and fibrinogen in plasma; elevation of platelet factor-3 (PF-3) activity in platelet-poor plasma (PPP); increase in serum levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin, orosomucoid, haptoglobin and properdin factor B; and shortening of the lag period of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Filtration of PPP through Millipore filters removed PF-3 membranes. The differences in PF-3 activities in filtered plasma were no longer significant between smokers and non-smokers. Results suggest that chronic smokers have higher levels of acute phase proteins reflecting underlying inflammatory processes, and …
22922225	Elder abuse and psychological well-being: a systematic review and implications for research and policy--a mini review.	aging	2013-??-??	Elder abuse and psychological distress are both important geriatric syndromes and are independently associated with premature morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances, there has been little systematic exploration of the association between elder abuse and psychological distress. This systematic review synthesizes the qualitative and quantitative studies on the relationship between elder abuse and psychological distress, namely psychological distress as a risk factor and/or a consequence of elder abuse. Moreover, through this review, future research directions for elder abuse and psychological distress and their implications for practice and policy to improve the health and aging of vulnerable populations are also highlighted.
22790951	New rapid screening method for anti-aging compounds using budding yeast and identification of beauveriolide I as a potent active compound.	lifespan, aging	2012-??-??	The chronological lifespan (CLS) of budding yeast is a model for the aging of post-mitotic cells in higher eukaryotes. We report here the development of a new method to assess yeast CLS. The new assay is simple, convenient and labor-saving. We applied this new method to screen natural compounds isolated from mushrooms and discovered beauveriolide I as a potent anti-aging agent.
19661832	Enhanced fatigue resistance in older adults during repeated sets of intermittent contractions.	aging	2010-01-??	Reportedly, muscle fatigue in older individuals is greater, less than, or similar to young individuals, potentially because of differences in muscle groups studied, type of contraction, continuous vs. intermittent contractions, exercise duration, duty cycle, and contraction speed. During a single set of isokinetic mode knee extensions, muscle fatigue is similar between older and younger individuals. However, repeated sets may favor the more oxidative nature of muscle from older adults and may be necessary to reveal age-associated enhanced fatigue resistance. The purpose of this investigation was to compare muscular fatigue induced by repeated sets of intermittent isokinetic mode knee extensions in older and younger males. Nineteen older (mean +/- SD) (66 +/- 6 yr) and 16 younger (21 +/- 2 yr) men completed 5 sets of 30 isokinetic mode knee extensions at 180 degrees/second. In the analysis of absolute fatigue, both groups significantly decreased torque production during each set, with y…
26626913	Effects of immobilization and aerobic training on proteins related to intramuscular substrate storage and metabolism in young and older men.	aging	2016-03-??	PURPOSE: Aging and inactivity lead to skeletal muscle metabolic inflexibility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely elucidated. Therefore, we investigated how muscle lipid and glycogen stores and major regulatory proteins were affected by short-term immobilization followed by aerobic training in young and older men.    METHODS: 17 young (23 ± 1 years, 24 ± 1 kg m(-2), and 20 ± 2% body fat) and 15 older men (68 ± 1 years; 27 ± 1 kg m(-2), and 29 ± 2% body fat) underwent 2 weeks' one leg immobilization followed by 6 weeks' cycle training. Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis just before immobilization (at inclusion), after immobilization, and the after 6 weeks' training. The biopsies were analyzed for muscle substrates; muscle perilipin protein (PLIN), glycogen synthase (GS), synaptosomal-associated protein of 23 kDa (SNAP23) protein content, and muscle 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activity    RESULTS: The older men had higher intramuscular triglyc…
27521253	Skin aging and oxidative stress: Equol's anti-aging effects via biochemical and molecular mechanisms.	aging	2016-??-??	Oxygen in biology is essential for life. It comes at a cost during normal cellular function, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by oxidative metabolism. Human skin exposed to solar ultra-violet radiation (UVR) dramatically increases ROS production/oxidative stress. It is important to understand the characteristics of human skin and how chronological (intrinsic) aging and photo-aging (extrinsic aging) occur via the impact of ROS production by cascade signaling pathways. The goal is to oppose or neutralize ROS insults to maintain good dermal health. Botanicals, as active ingredients, represent one of the largest categories used in dermatology and cosmeceuticals to combat skin aging. An emerging botanical is equol, a polyphenolic/isoflavonoid molecule found in plants and food products and via gastrointestinal metabolism from precursor compounds. Introductory sections cover oxygen, free radicals (ROS), oxidative stress, antioxidants, human skin aging, cellular/molecular ROS …
21242192	Vitamin E may affect the life expectancy of men, depending on dietary vitamin C intake and smoking.	lifespan, aging	2011-03-??	BACKGROUND: antioxidants might protect against oxidative stress, which has been suggested as a cause of aging.    METHODS: the Alpha-Tocopherol-Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Study recruited males aged 50-69 years who smoked at least five cigarettes per day at the baseline. The current study was restricted to participants who were followed up past the age of 65. Deaths were identified in the National Death Registry (1,445 deaths). We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all participants, and for four subgroups defined by dietary vitamin C intake and level of smoking. We also constructed Cox regression models allowing a different vitamin E effect for low and high age ranges.    RESULTS: among all 10,837 participants, vitamin E had no effect on those who were 65-70 years old, but reduced mortality by 24% when participants were 71 or older. Among 2,284 men with dietary vitamin C intakes above the median who smoked less than a pack of cigarettes per day, vitamin E extended lifespan by 2 year…
3192953	Cyclobutane-type pyrimidine photodimer formation and induction of ornithine decarboxylase in human skin fibroblasts after UV irradiation.	aging	1988-12-??	Cyclobutane-type pyrimidine photodimers as well as the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) may serve as biochemical markers of the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light (UV). For this reason, it is important to compare the formation of pyrimidine dimers with the induction of ODC in human skin fibroblasts after irradiation with UVC (200-290 nm) and UVB (290-320 nm). In our studies we determined cytosine-thymine (C-T) as well as thymine-thymine dimer yields (T-T) by high-pressure liquid chromatography in cultures of neonatal normal human foreskin-derived fibroblasts after irradiation with UVC and UVB light. It was found that the yield of dimerization and the ratio of T-T/C-T decreased from the UVC to the UVB region. Time-course studies of ODC-induction in the same cells indicated that the maximal activity after UVB irradiation was retarded compared to UVC exposure. For the UV-induced ODC-levels, however, no significant difference in maximal induction could be mea…
28143774	Disentangling resting-state BOLD variability and PCC functional connectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.	aging	2017-??-01	Although often ignored in fMRI studies, moment-to-moment variability of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals reveals important information about brain function. Indeed, higher brain signal variability has been associated with better cognitive performance in young adults compared to children and elderly adults. Functional connectivity, a very common approach in resting-state fMRI analysis, is scaled for variance. Thus, alterations might be confounded or driven by BOLD signal variance alterations. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with a vast cognitive and clinical phenotype. To date, several resting-state fMRI studies reported altered functional connectivity in 22q11.2DS, however BOLD signal variance has not yet been analyzed. Here, we employed PLS correlation analysis to reveal multivariate patterns of diagnosis-related alterations and age-relationship throughout the cortex of 50 patients between 9 and 25 ye…
30942277	Inflammatory markers and occurrence of falls: Bambuí Cohort Study of Aging.	aging	2019-04-01	OBJECTIVE: Analyze whether inflammatory markers are associated with falls among older adults living in Bambuí.    METHODS: Study that analyzed baseline data from a Bambuí Cohort Study of Aging, involving 1,250 participants. Data about falls were collected from previous 12 months, classified as single or multiple occurrence and severity (participant seeking health services). Information about sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors and health condition was also collected and used as confounding factors. The exposures of interest included interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP) and chemokines (CXCL9, CCL5, CCL10, MCP1). Data were processed through logistic regression, obtaining odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95%CI).    RESULTS: The prevalence of falls was 27.1%; 40.1% of the older adults reported multiple falls and 33.3% sought health services. After adjustments, the following elevated le…
11794737	The uptake of dental services by elderly Germans.	aging	2001-12-??	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the uptake of dental services by the old and very old population within the scope of the Berlin Aging Study (Berliner Altersstudie BASE).    DESIGN: A multi-disciplinary structured interview was performed on 928 subjects, aged from 70 to 103 years of whom 516 persons volunteered to take part in a 14-session intensive protocol. Six representative study groups were matched for age and gender. Subjects were asked to recall the timing of their most recent dental visit. Data were validated by sending for dental records and compared with all study participants from the multi-disciplinary intake assessment. Data were related to age group, dental state, dementia and education.    RESULTS: Reported last contact with dental services ranged from 2 weeks to 52 years (median 18 months) with a higher time lapse in the study groups aged 85 and older. Dentate subjects had seen their dentist more recently than edentate subjects. Higher education correlated …
11507650	Systemic insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin and vitamin D status in relation to age-associated bone loss in women.	aging	2001-??-??	This cross-sectional study, performed on 146 healthy (n = 64) or osteoporotic but otherwise normal (n = 82) pre- (n = 38) or post-menopausal (n = 108) female subjects, analyzed the relationships between bone mineral density (BMD) (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), parameters of bone remodelling, indices of calcium homeostasis and systemic IGF-I or insulin levels against a background of natural aging. BMD (g/cm(2)) at the hip correlated to serum IGF-I concentration (r = 0.207, p < 0.05), as well as to insulin levels (r = 0.241, p < 0.01), while BMD at the spine correlated only to IGF-I levels (r = 0.173, p < 0.05). After adjustment for age, body mass index, serum PTH, vitamin D status and calcitonin levels, neither IGF-I nor insulin levels could be significantly related to BMD at the spine or hip. On the other hand, 25-OH vitamin D(3) was found to be an important predictor of BMD at the hip (beta = 0.1686, p = 0.0437). In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate a predi…
11427700	Prospective measurements of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in a cohort of elderly subjects: relationship to gender, subjective health, smoking habits, and 10-year mortality.	longevity	2001-07-03	The decrease with age of the adrenal-secreted dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in serum has suggested that it may be causally related to longevity. For the PAQUID [People (Personnes) Aged (Agées) About What (Quid, in Latin)] cohort of elderly subjects, we have previously reported higher DHEAS in men than in women, a decrease with age and, among men, a negative correlation between the DHEAS level and mortality at 2 and 4 years. Here, with an 8-year followup in 290 subjects, we show a global decrease of 2.3% per year for men and 3.9% per year for women. However, in approximately 30% of cases, there was an increase of DHEAS. We observed no relationship between the evolution of DHEAS level and functional, psychological, and mental status, possibly because of selection by death. In women, no association was found between mortality and DHEAS level. In men, the relative risk (RR) of death was higher for the lowest levels of DHEAS (RR = 1.9, P = 0.007), with RR = 6.5, P = 0.003 for those…
27103045	Predictive Value of Frailty Indices for Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults.	longevity, aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: There are two widely used tools to classify frailty in older adults: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. Both have been validated for prediction of adverse outcomes.    OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of different frailty indices to predict a number of adverse outcomes (falls, disability, and mortality) by adding deficits in a fixed sequence (with the first five deficits as in the frailty phenotype: weakness, weight loss, slowness, exhaustion and low physical activity) or randomly.    METHODS: This is an analysis of the Costa-Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study in which ≥ 60-year-old adults were included and followed up for four years. Frailty indices were constructed, including the frailty phenotype components in the first five indices followed by the random addition of other deficits and estimating for each one the odds ratios for falls and disability and hazard ratios for mortality, adjusted for age and sex.    RESULTS: We included 2,708 adults; mean age wa…
21167934	Lipofuscin inhibits the proteasome by binding to surface motifs.	aging	2011-03-01	Lipofuscin, a highly oxidized aggregate, consists of covalently cross-linked proteins, lipids, and sugar residues and is one of the major life-span-limiting factors in postmitotic aging cells. An artificial model of this material, showing characteristics and effects comparable to those of the natural form, has turned out to be very useful for in vitro studies. Artificial lipofuscin was used to investigate its effects on the viability of human fibroblasts, its rate of uptake, and its ability to inhibit the proteasomal system. The inhibition of the proteasomal system is one of the major aspects of the cytotoxic effects of lipofuscin. We present here that this proteasomal inhibition is due to proteasomal binding to the lipofuscin surface motifs, degradable by protease K. Furthermore, removal of the surface peptide structures by protease K strongly reduces the cytotoxic effects of lipofuscin and binding of cellular proteins and proteasomes to intracellular protein aggregates.
9723031	Comparison of chromosome telomere integrity in multiple tissues from subjects at different ages.	aging	1998-09-??	Telomere DNA, at the ends of each chromosome, is conserved in nature and required for chromosome replication and stability. Reduction in telomere length has been observed in several malignancies as well as in leukocytes from healthy persons with advancing age. There is a paucity of data regarding telomere length and the effects of in vivo aging in different tissues. These data could be helpful in interpreting telomere length and understanding the role of telomere integrity and telomerase activity in malignant cells. We report telomeric DNA integrity studies of blood and skin collected from eight Caucasians of both sexes representing each decade of life from the fetus to 72 years of age without exposure to chemotherapy or radiation. In addition, telomeric data from 15 other tissues from the fetus and 8 other tissues from the 72-year-old male were examined. No significant differences were found in the shortest telomere size, the average telomere size, or telomere size variation between b…

By controlling life-style and environmental hazards and seeking appropriate medical care, many people can enjoy a healthy, independent old age; various psychological schema provide models for such "successful" aging. But we must turn to the humanities for a vision of aging that sees meaning in lives characterized by incontinence, immobility, and confusion.
25411247	Human NAT10 is an ATP-dependent RNA acetyltransferase responsible for N4-acetylcytidine formation in 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA).	aging	2014-12-26	Human N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is known to be a lysine acetyltransferase that targets microtubules and histones and plays an important role in cell division. NAT10 is highly expressed in malignant tumors, and is also a promising target for therapies against laminopathies and premature aging. Here we report that NAT10 is an ATP-dependent RNA acetyltransferase responsible for formation of N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac(4)C) at position 1842 in the terminal helix of mammalian 18 S rRNA. RNAi-mediated knockdown of NAT10 resulted in growth retardation of human cells, and this was accompanied by high-level accumulation of the 30 S precursor of 18 S rRNA, suggesting that ac(4)C1842 formation catalyzed by NAT10 is involved in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis.
24998470	Proinflammatory status influences NK cells subsets in the elderly.	aging	2014-11-??	Aging is associated to dysfunctional changes in the immune system, a process termed immunosenescence. Elderly individuals usually present chronic low level inflammation, likely as the consequence of continued exposure to antigens combined with poor immune function, increases in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by effector memory and senescent T cells and macrophages. This condition not only results from, but also drives immunosenescence. Aging affects all cell components of the immune system, including NK cells and its different subsets (CD56dimCD16+, CD56brightCD16+/- and CD56-CD16+). In particular, the percentage of total NK cells is increased in healthy aging and centenarians, whereas there is a decrease in the CD56bright NK cell subset and an expansion of CD56-CD16+ NK cells. However, the causes of these alterations on NK cells in old donors are not fully understood. In this work we analyse NK cell subsets in the elderly in relation with markers of inflammation and health s…

Here we show that the assembly of stress granules (SGs) is part of the early events used by senescent cells to respond to certain stresses. Although SGs can form in response to stress during senescence activation, their number significantly increases once the cells are fully senescent. This increase correlates with a rapid decrease in the expression levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, an important activator of senescence. Throughout stress, p21 mRNA is stabilized and localizes to SGs, but only during late senescence does this localization interferes with its translation. Additionally, we observed that when the stress is relieved, senescent cells produce lower levels of p21 protein, which correlates with a small delay in SG disassembly. Therefore, our data suggest that SG formation and the reduction in p21 protein levels represent two main events b…
531041	Erythrocyte disorders leading to potassium loss and cellular dehydration.	aging	1979-??-??	RBC K loss and cellular dehydration are associated with a variety of normal and abnormal erythrocyte conditions. In some cases (normal RBC aging, pyruvate-kinase-deficient RBCs and irreversibly sickled cells) cation and water changes are related to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and to increased RBC calcium content. In other disorders, such as hereditary xerocytosis, cation depletion and cellular hydration are not related to altered energy or calcium metabolism. Rather, this condition is thought to be due to a structural membrane defect which is manifested by imbalanced cation leaks (K less greater than Na gain) for which the active cation transport is unable to compensate. None of the disorders described here are associated with known structural membrane alterations. The fact that K loss and cellular dehydration are common to several RBC disorders suggests that this phenomenon may have a direct role in membrane injury. This hypothesis is supported by two separate observations:…
11382906	Sleep/wake cycle and physical activity in healthy elderly people.	aging	2000-??-??	Investigations concerning the temporal organization of the sleep/wake cycle (SWC) in healthy active elderly, specially focusing possible relationships between regular daily routines, sleep fragmentation and sleep quality in aging are still scarce. We studied the SWC of 23 healthy active elderly (65-76 years old) of both sexes (15 female, 8 male), engaged in an exercise program for old people, considering that physical exercise sessions could represent a strategy for keeping structured daily routines. We report the relationships between SWC characteristics and performance of physical exercises viewed as time cues. We collected SWC data by means of sleep logs and data about light exposition by means of actigraphy during 23 consecutive days. Individuals who chose earlier times for exercising showed longer exposition to natural bright light and reported better sleep quality. Indications that physical exercises could be beneficial upon sleep were scarce (better subjective sleep quality). St…
6106029	Alterations in cyclic nucleotides and cyclase-specific activities in T lymphocytes of aging normal humans and patients with Down's syndrome.	aging	1980-10-??	The levels of cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in unstimulated (resting) peripheral blood thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) from normal old humans and young-adult Down's syndrome (DS) patients were markedly decreased when compared with those of young normal humans. By contrast, the cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in resting T cells from normal old and young-adult DS patients were greatly increased. The cAMP/cGMP ratios for unstimulated T cells therefore declined in normal aged and DS subjects. The specific activity of adenylate cyclase (ATP pyrophosphate-lyase[cycling]E.C.4.6.1.1) was elevated in T cells from the aged and DS groups, whereas that of guanylate cyclase (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase[cycling]E.C.4.6.1.2) decreased with age and in DS. These results denote the existence of substantial age-related biochemical changes in peripheral T cells. An imbalance in resting cyclic nucleotide levels and their generating enzymes in T cells of normal aging and DS subjects…
6511366	Specific antibody synthesis in vitro. II. Age-associated thymosin enhancement of antitetanus antibody synthesis.	aging	1984-10-??	A decline in T cell function accounts for many of the observed age-related deficient immune responses. Specific antibody response to many antigens requires T cell cooperation, and deficient antibody response to such antigens has been demonstrated with aging. In an effort to assess the potential reconstitutive capacity of Thymosin Fraction 5, in vitro antitetanus antibody production was measured in tetanus toxoid booster-immunized young and old volunteers. 22 young and 12 old volunteers were immunized with tetanus toxoid and plasma antitetanus antibody and in vitro lymphocyte production of antitetanus antibody was measured. Plasma antitetanus antibody response was significantly greater in the young. In vitro antitetanus antibody synthesis was negligible prior to immunization and peaked in cultures established 1 week after immunization from both young and old. When Thymosin Fraction 5 was added to the cultures, however, there was a dose-related enhancement of antibody synthesis in 7 of 1…
19657548	Oxidative stress in older patients with iron deficiency anaemia.	aging	2009-10-??	We propose that oxidative damage may play a role in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Participants were selected from Basic Attention Ambulatory from North of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. All subjects were older than 65 years - 17 patients with IDA and primary hypertension and 18 patients with primary hypertension (control group) were included in the present study. We measured antioxidant defenses including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total glutathione (GSH) by spectrophotometric assays. We also determined protein oxidative damage in haemolysate and plasma by carbonyl assay. We characterized the lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. The results show that IDA patients had significantly higher CAT and SOD levels than controls. GPx activity was not different between the groups. Oxidative protein damage was noted in the plasma but not in the haemolysate. A significantly enhanced production of MDA was obser…
15277176	Hormonal and lifestyle determinants of appendicular skeletal muscle mass in men: the MINOS study.	aging	2004-08-??	BACKGROUND: Aging-related sarcopenia is characterized by a loss of muscle mass and strength and increased fatigability. However, studies of its determinants in elderly men are scarce.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated risk factors for sarcopenia in a large cohort of men.    DESIGN: We analyzed 845 men aged 45-85 y who belonged to the MINOS cohort. Lifestyle factors (physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, caffeine intake) were evaluated by using a standardized questionnaire. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was estimated by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (RASM) was calculated as ASM/body height(2.3). Apparent free testosterone concentration (AFTC) and free testosterone index (FTI) were calculated on the basis of concentrations of total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin.    RESULTS: RASM decreased with age (r = -0.29, P < 0.0001). Current smokers had lower RASM than did subjects who never smoked (-3…
23441628	Age-related changes in skin bio-mechanical properties: the neck skin compared with the cheek and forearm skin in Korean females.	aging	2013-08-??	BACKGROUND: There are many reports on regional variations in skin bio-mechanical properties, but few studies have been performed on the neck. The neck is sun-exposed and continues to move so the neck skin can be more apt to aging.    METHODS: The skin properties of the neck, cheek, and ventral forearm of 58 Korean female volunteers in good health (25-64 years old, 42.3 ± 11.7) were assessed non-invasively with skin measuring devices, and the correlation with age and wrinkles was analyzed.    RESULTS: Neck skin was more extensible, elastic and visco-elastic than the cheek. The dermal layer for the neck skin was thinner and more intense than the cheek, but the results were opposite when compared with the skin of the forearm. We could observe that the subcutaneous layer was divided by the fascia with regard to the neck skin, and this thickness increased BMI-dependently. The neck skin had the correlation between R0, R3, and dermal thickness. The correlation coefficient of elasticity on the…
21124794	Mitochondrial rejuvenation after induced pluripotency.	aging	2010-11-23	BACKGROUND: As stem cells of the early embryo mature and differentiate into all tissues, the mitochondrial complement undergoes dramatic functional improvement. Mitochondrial activity is low to minimize generation of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species during pre-implantation development and increases following implantation and differentiation to meet higher metabolic demands. It has recently been reported that when the stem cell type known as induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) are re-differentiated for several weeks in vitro, the mitochondrial complement progressively re-acquires properties approximating input fibroblasts, suggesting that despite the observation that IPSC conversion "resets" some parameters of cellular aging such as telomere length, it may have little impact on other age-affected cellular systems such as mitochondria in IPSC-derived cells.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have examined the properties of mitochondria in two fibroblast lines, corresponding IPS…
21795702	WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) delays cellular senescence by promoting p27(Kip1) degradation in human diploid fibroblasts.	lifespan	2011-09-23	WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) plays an important role in the proliferation of tumor cells and the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the role of WWP1 in cellular senescence is still unknown. Here, we show that the expression patterns of p27(Kip1) and WWP1 are inversely correlated during cellular senescence. Moreover, the overexpression of WWP1 delayed senescence, whereas the knockdown of WWP1 led to premature senescence in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WWP1 repressed endogenous p27(Kip1) expression through ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Additionally, WWP1 had a strong preference for catalyzing the Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of p27(Kip1) in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that WWP1 markedly inhibited the replicative senescence induced by p27(Kip1) by promoting p27(Kip1) degradation. Therefore, our study provides a new molecular mechanism for the regulation of cellular senescence.
16806052	MMI1 (YKL056c, TMA19), the yeast orthologue of the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) has apoptotic functions and interacts with both microtubules and mitochondria.	lifespan	????-??-??	The yeast orthologue of mammalian TCTP is here proposed to be named Mmi1p (microtubule and mitochondria interacting protein). This protein displays about 50% amino acid sequence identity with its most distantly related orthologs in higher organisms and therefore probably belongs to a small class of yeast proteins which have housekeeping but so far incompletely known functions needed for every eukaryotic cell. Previous investigations of the protein in both higher cells and yeast revealed that it is highly expressed during active growth, but transcriptionally down-regulated in several kinds of stress situations including starvation stress. In human cells, TCTP presumably has anti-apoptotic functions as it binds to Bcl-XL in vivo. TCTP of higher cells was also shown to interact with the translational machinery. It has acquired an additional function in the mammalian immune system, as it is identical with the histamine releasing factor. Here, we show that in S. cerevisiae induction of apop…
9514220	Drinking water fluoridation: bone mineral density and hip fracture incidence.	aging	1998-03-??	The role of drinking water fluoride content for prevention of osteoporosis remains controversial. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of drinking water fluoridation on the incidence of osteoporotic hip fractures and bone mineral density (BMD) in two different communities in eastern Germany: in Chemnitz, drinking water was fluoridated (1 mg/L) over a period of 30 years; in Halle, the water was not fluoridated. BMD was measured in healthy hospital employees aged 20-60 years (Halle: 214 women, 98 men; Chemnitz: 201 women, 43 men, respectively) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Hip fractures in patients > or = 35 years admitted to the local hospitals in the years 1987-1989 were collected from the clinic registers. There was no difference in age, anthropometric, hormonal, or lifestyle variables between the two groups. Mean fluoride exposure in Chemnitz was 25.2 +/- 7.3 years. No correlation was found between fluoride exposure and age-adjusted BMD. We found no significant difference i…
25879942	Psychosocial factors for influencing healthy aging in adults in Korea.	aging	2015-03-07	BACKGROUND: Healthy aging includes physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being in later years. The purpose of this study is to identify the psychosocial factors influencing healthy aging and examining their socio-demographic characteristics. Perceived health status, depression, self-esteem, self-achievement, ego-integrity, participation in leisure activities, and loneliness were identified as influential factors in healthy aging.    METHODS: 171 Korean adults aged between 45 and 77 years-old participated in the study. Self-reporting questionnaires were used, followed by descriptive statistics and multiple regressions as inferential statistical analyses.    RESULTS: There were significant differences between participants' general characteristics: age, education, religion, housing, hobby, and economic status. The factors related to healthy aging had positive correlation with perceived health status, self-esteem, self-achievements, and leisure activities, and negative correl…
18548867	As good as it gets? Rethinking old age.	aging	2008-05-??	Although approximately half of aging Americans will probably not be able to live independently after retirement age, there is a greater focus on end-of-life matters, such as living wills, than on exploring creative long-term care models that promote healthy aging. With more Americans aging healthfully, now is the time to look at innovations in long-term care that will not only provide safe housing, but will also focus on the trajectory from healthy aging to end-of-life care, including health promotion and even reversal of disabilities incurred in the aging process. Nurses and other health care professionals need to rethink how those they care for will live out their later years and explore creative approaches for extending living options that foster autonomy.
18284340	Neural processes supporting young and older adults' emotional memories.	aging	2008-07-??	Young and older adults are more likely to remember emotional information than neutral information. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the neural processes supporting young (ages 18-35) and older (ages 62-79) adults' successful encoding of positive, negative, and neutral objects (e.g., a sundae, a grenade, a canoe). The results revealed general preservation of the emotional memory network across the age groups. Both groups recruited the amygdala and the orbito-frontal cortex during the successful encoding of positive and negative information. Both ages also showed valence-specific recruitment: right fusiform activity was greatest during the successful encoding of negative information, whereas left prefrontal and temporal activity was greatest during the successful encoding of positive information. These valence-specific processes are consistent with behavioral evidence that negative information is processed with perceptual detail, whereas positive informati…
25267556	Age-related morphometric changes of inner structures of the skin assessed by in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy.	aging	2015-03-??	BACKGROUND: In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy is a useful technique for non-invasive biometry of cutaneous inner structures. In this study, the changes in the inner structures were examined in a wide age range of healthy Japanese using this technique.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin on the flexor side of the arm and on the face, which represent sun-protected and sun-exposed sites of the skin, respectively, was examined in 52 healthy Japanese subjects aged 6 months-81 years old using a reflectance confocal microscope Vivascope(®) 3000.    RESULTS: The size of granular cells increased with age and was larger in the group aged over 50 years than in the young group aged 18-21 years old, at both sites. The size of prickle cells also increased with age in the face but not in the arm. The size of dermal papillae measured at depths of 50 μm (Z = 50 μm) and 80 μm (Z = 80 μm) from the surface decreased with age. The size at Z = 80 μm was smaller in the older group than in the younger group …
11682425	T-wave amplitude as an indicator for detecting intravascular injection of epinephrine test dose in awake and anesthetized elderly patients.	aging	2001-11-??	UNLABELLED: Aging is associated with reduced heart rate (HR) responsiveness to a simulated IV test dose containing epinephrine. We tested the hypothesis that a more contemporary T-wave criterion (positive if there was a > or = 25% decrease in T-wave amplitude) was applicable in both awake and anesthetized older patients. Sixteen healthy patients > or = 65 yr old first received 3 mL of normal saline IV, followed 4 min later by 1.5% lidocaine 3 mL containing 15 microg epinephrine (1:200,000) IV in the supine position when awake, and they were anesthetized with stable 2% end-tidal sevoflurane and 67% nitrous oxide. HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP) determined invasively, and lead II of the electrocardiogram were continuously recorded for 4 min after the IV injections of saline and the test dose. A sensitivity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 89% were obtained in awake patients on the basis of the conventional HR criterion (positive if there was a > or = 20 bpm increase), whereas …
24449371	Accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigments of walnuts (Carya cathayensis) during storage: potential roles of lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic glycosylation.	aging	2014-09-??	BACKGROUND: Lipofuscin-like pigments (LFLP) are considered a hallmark of aging. The intracellular LFLP formation rate is negatively correlated with the life expectancy of cell. In food quality, increase of LFLP not only affects the appearance but also causes loss of nutritional value.    RESULTS: The accumulation of LFLP increased during storage of all walnuts. LFLP fluorescent intensities of walnuts with 4%, 6%, 12% and 16% moisture at the end of storage were 8.1, 4.8, 4.3 and 2.8 times those at the beginning, respectively. The LFLP accumulation of walnuts with high moisture was found to be negatively correlated with soluble sugars and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical quenching rate, but positively correlated with the content of hydroxymethylfuraldehyde (HMF). While the LFLP accumulation of walnuts with low moisture had a strong positive correlation with anisidine value, it exhibited high negative correlations with acid phosphatase activity, DPPH(•) quenching rate and toco…
2721600	Decreased accuracy of protein synthesis in extracts from aging human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1989-??-??	The accuracy of protein synthesis has been measured in extracts from human diploid fibroblasts of different ages. Extracts were supplied with purified mRNA for the coat protein of the cowpea variant of tobacco mosaic virus (CcTMV), which lacks codons for cysteine and methionine. The presence of 35S-cysteine in CcTMV coat protein synthesized during translation reactions therefore represents translational error. Translation reactions were performed with extracts from young fibroblasts (less than 50% of life span completed) and old fibroblasts (more than 90% of life span completed), and the translation products were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The error frequency increased from 4.2 x 10(-5) cysteines/amino acid in young cell extracts to 2.9 x 10(-4) cysteines/amino acid in old cell extracts. Cysteine incorporation was not due to nonspecific binding, and could be increased approximately sixfold by the addition of the misreading antibi…
21868393	Impairment of lon-induced protection against the accumulation of oxidized proteins in senescent wi-38 fibroblasts.	aging	2011-11-??	Oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins is thought to contribute to the aging process, but the Lon protease normally degrades such proteins. In early-passage WI-38 human lung fibroblasts, Lon expression is rapidly induced during H(2)O(2) stress, which prevents the accumulation of oxidized proteins and protects cell viability. In contrast, middle passage cells exhibit only sluggish induction of Lon expression in oxidative stress, and oxidized proteins initially accumulate. Late-passage, or senescent, cells have low basal levels of Lon and high levels of accumulated oxidized proteins; in response to oxidative stress, they fail to induce Lon expression and exhibit continually increasing accumulation of oxidized proteins. Senescent cells separated into two populations, one exhibiting normal mitochondrial mass and a second displaying significant loss of mitochondria; both populations had diminished mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These senescent changes are similar to the effects …
16316683	Oxidative degradation in highly cross-linked and conventional polyethylene after 2 years of real-time shelf aging.	aging	2006-04-??	Previous studies have reported oxidative degradation of conventional polyethylene (PE) components during shelf aging, following radiation. However, no studies have yet reported data concerning the effect of real-time shelf aging in the manufacturer's packaging on the oxidative degradation of commercially available highly cross-linking PE components. The null hypothesis tested was that in either highly cross-linked or conventional PE acetabular components there would be no significant difference in the amount of oxidative degradation between time zero PE liners and PE liners that had been real-time shelf aged for 2 years in their respective packaging. The results of the study indicated that after 2 years of real-time shelf aging, negligible oxidative degradation occurred with minimal changes in oxidation index, density, and percent crystallinity in commercially available highly cross-linked and conventional PE acetabular liners. These data suggested that oxidative degradation was not a …
11688800	Differences in composition and mucosal adhesion of bifidobacteria isolated from healthy adults and healthy seniors.	aging	2001-11-??	Fifty-one Bifidobacterium strains were isolated from the feces of healthy adults (30-40 years old) and seniors (older than 70 years of age). B. adolescentis, B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were isolated from the healthy adults and B. adolescentis and B. longum from elderly subjects. The tested bacteria bound, in vitro, to intestinal mucus in a strain dependent manner. The strains isolated from healthy adults, and especially B. adolescentis, bound better to intestinal mucus than those isolated from seniors. These results indicate that the mucosal adhesive properties of the human Bifidobacterium flora were reduced with the aging of the host. This shift to a Bifidobacterium flora with reduced adhesive abilities may explain the decrease in bifidobacteria levels in the intestinal microflora of aging people.
28706001	Aspirin as a COX inhibitor and anti-inflammatory drug in human skeletal muscle.	aging	2017-??-01	Although aspirin is one of the most common anti-inflammatory drugs in the world, the effect of aspirin on human skeletal muscle inflammation is almost completely unknown. This study examined the potential effects and related time course of an orally consumed aspirin dose on the inflammatory prostaglandin E (PGE)/cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in human skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis of 10 healthy adults (5 male and 5 female, 25 ± 2 yr old) before (Pre) and 2, 4, and 24 h after (Post) a standard dose (975mg) of aspirin and partitioned for analysis of 1) in vivo PGE levels in resting skeletal muscle and 2) ex vivo skeletal muscle PGE production when stimulated with the COX substrate arachidonic acid (5 μM). PGE levels in vivo and PGE production ex vivo were generally unchanged at each time point after aspirin consumption. However, most individuals clearly showed suppression of PGE, but at varying time points after aspirin consumption. When the…
26746225	Older Parents Benefit More in Health Outcome From Daughters' Than Sons' Emotional Care in China.	longevity	2016-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether older parents in China would benefit more from daughters' care than from sons' emotional care.    METHOD: Analysis of the unique data sets of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey conducted in 2002, 2005, and 2008-2009 in 22 provinces.    RESULTS: As compared with having son(s), having daughter(s) is significantly more beneficial at older ages in China, with regard to maintaining higher cognitive capacity and reducing mortality risk. Such daughter advantages in providing emotional care to older parents are more profound among the oldest-old aged 80+ as compared with the young-old aged 65 to 79 and surprisingly more profound in rural areas as compared with urban areas, even though son preference is much more common among rural residents.    DISCUSSION: We describe how educational campaigns aimed at informing the public about the benefits of daughter(s) for older parents' health outcome could help promote gender equality and reduce traditional so…
18795357	Plasma omega-3 fatty acid response to a fish oil supplement in the healthy elderly.	aging	2008-11-??	Little information is available concerning whether incorporation of dietary omega-3 fatty acids into plasma lipids changes during healthy aging. Elderly (74 +/- 4 years old) and young (24 +/- 2 years old) adults were given a fish oil supplement for 3 weeks that provided 680 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid and 320 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid, followed by a 2 week wash-out period. Compliance was monitored by spiking the capsules with carbon-13 glucose, the excretion of which was measured in breath CO2. In response to the supplement, plasma docosahexaenoic acid rose 42% more in the elderly but eicosapentaenoic responded similarly in both groups. Despite raising docosahexaenoic acid intake by five to tenfold, the supplement did not raise plasma free docosahexaenoic acid (% or mg/dL) in either group. We conclude that healthy aging is accompanied by subtle but significant changes in DHA incorporation into plasma lipids.
30530151	Long-term leaching of arsenic from pressure-treated playground structures in the northeastern United States.	aging	2019-03-15	Wood used in playground structures built prior to 2004 was pressure-treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) which has been associated with negative health and environmental impacts. Given the prevalence and lack of maintenance of these aging play structures in rural northeastern US, the aim of this study was to determine the distribution of As (total, speciated and bioaccessible) in surface soil collected near and underneath four CCA-treated playground structures 16- and 26-years following installation. Note that one playground in southeastern MA was studied where surface soil samples were collected at various distances from the structures (0, 5, 15, and 30 cm). Total As in surface soil was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas As speciation and bioaccessible As were determined by HPLC-ICPMS and in vitro SBRC-gastric assay, respectively. Near (≤5 cm) and underneath CCA-treated structures total As concentration in surface soil ranged from 143.4-213.5 …
22770866	Association between elder self-neglect and hospice utilization in a community population.	aging	????-??-??	Elder self-neglect is associated with substantial 1-year mortality. However, hospice utilization among those with self-neglect remain unclear. The objective of this study is to quantify the prospective relation between self-neglect and risk for hospice utilization in a community population of older adults. Prospective population-based study in a geographically defined community in Chicago of older adults who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Of the 8669 participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a subset of 1438 participants was reported to social services agency for suspected elder self-neglect. Outcome of interest was the hospice utilization obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid System. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess independent association of self-neglect with risk of hospice utilization using time-varying covariate analyses. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, elders who self-neglect was associated with …
6773977	The influence of age, alcohol consumption, and body build on gonadal function in men.	aging	1980-09-??	Basal plasma levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and gonadotropins and testosterone-binding capacity (percent radioactive testosterone bound to protein) were measured in health carefully screened young (31-44 yr old; n = 44) and older (64-88 yr old; n = 42) male participants in the Normative Aging Study of the V.A. There was no statistically significant effect of age on testosterone [younger group, 4.16 +/- 0.27 (SEM) ng/ml; older group, 4.62 +/- 0.32 (SEM) ng/ml] or the free testosterone index [younger group, 2.05 +/- 0.14 (SEM) ng/ml; older group, 1.76 +/- 0.11 (SEM) ng/ml]. The testosterone-binding capacity was higher in the older group (younger group, 50.10 +/- 1.18% (SEM); older group, 60.10 +/- 1.18% (SEM); P less than 0.001). Of the two products of testosterone metabolism studied, estradiol did not change with age, while dihydrotestosterone was lower [young group, 0.25 +/- 0.02 (SEM) ng/ml; older group, 0.20 +/- 0.01 (SEM) ng/ml; P = 0.03] in the older group.…
28676292	Intestinal Permeability Biomarker Zonulin is Elevated in Healthy Aging.	aging	2017-09-01	INTRODUCTION: Increased gut permeability ("leaky gut") has been proposed as a potential contributor to age-related inflammation and gut dysbiosis. However, information on the relationship between a leaky gut and inflammation and physical frailty during aging are limited.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that an aging-associated leaky gut is linked to the age-related inflammation and frailty.    METHODS: Two cohorts of healthy adults were studied: young (18-30 years old, n = 19) and older (≥70 years old, n = 18). Serum concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, zonulin (a marker for leaky gut), and high-mobility group box protein (HMGB1, a nuclear protein triggering inflammation) were measured. Correlations of serum levels of zonulin and HMGB1 with strength of plantar flexor muscles and number of steps taken per day were analyzed.    RESULTS: Serum concentration of zonulin and HMGB1 were 22% (P = .005) and 16% (P = .010) higher in the older ve…
16630374	Effects of age and ACL reconstruction on quadriceps gamma loop function.	aging	2006-??-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both aging and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are associated with strength deficits, which can in turn influence performance of activities of daily living. Thus it is informative to understand mechanisms underlying strength deficits. Age-related declines in strength follow reductions in muscle fiber numbers and size, whereas strength deficits following ACL reconstruction may be caused by the loss of intraligamentous mechanoreceptors. A common link between these conditions is the gamma spindle system, or the gamma loop. Appropriately applied vibration can affect the gamma loop by causing disruption of afferent feedback to a muscle and result in decreased force capabilities. We investigated the effect of age and ACL reconstruction on gamma loop function.    METHODS: Maximal isometric strength (MVC) and electromyography (EMG) of the quadriceps were quantified before and after vibration stimulation of the infrapatellar tendon of 3 groups: young heal…
23585863	Src regulates the activity of the ING1 tumor suppressor.	aging	2013-??-??	The INhibitor of Growth 1 (ING1) is stoichiometric member of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and functions as an epigenetic regulator and a type II tumor suppressor. It impacts cell growth, aging, apoptosis, and DNA repair, by affecting chromatin conformation and gene expression. Down regulation and mislocalization of ING1 have been reported in diverse tumor types and Ser/Thr phosphorylation has been implicated in both of these processes. Here we demonstrate that both in vitro and in vivo, the tyrosine kinase Src is able to physically associate with, and phosphorylate ING1, which results in a nuclear to cytoplasmic relocalization of ING1 in cells and a decrease of ING1 stability. Functionally, Src antagonizes the ability of ING1 to induce apoptosis, most likely through relocalization of ING1 and down regulation of ING1 levels. These effects were due to both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent properties of Src, and were most apparent at elevated levels of Src expression. These…
24974141	Oxidative stress in older patients with bipolar disorder.	aging	2015-03-??	OBJECTIVE: Increases in oxidative stress have been consistently reported in younger patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in postmortem brain and blood samples studies. Changes in oxidative stress are also associated with the natural aging process. Thus, the investigation of oxidative stress across the life span of patients with BD is crucial.    METHODS: We compared the levels of oxidative damage to proteins and lipids in plasma from 110 euthymic older patients with BD I or II (mean±SD age: 63.9±9.7 years) and 75 older healthy individuals (66.0±9.6 years). To assess protein oxidation, we measured the plasma levels of protein carbonyl (PC) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) using the ELISA technique. To assess lipid peroxidation, we measured plasma levels of lipid hydroperoxide (LPH) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) using spectrophotometric assays.    RESULTS: LPH levels were higher in patients than in the comparison healthy individuals, whereas there were no significant differences for PC, 3-NT, an…
30260763	Personality and Emotional Intelligence in Older Adults: A Predictive Model Based on Structural Equations Modeling.	aging	2019-??-??	Recent research on emotions in aging points to emotional intelligence (EI) as a factor that plays an important role in this process, and different conceptualizations of EI show that this construct is closely linked to personality in the general population. The main purpose of this study was to find out whether findings obtained in the general population indicating a predictive relationship between personality and EI are also confirmed during the aging process. A sample of 233 healthy older subjects between 60 and 90 years old was used. Participants answered two self-report scales on EI and personality, respectively. Structural equation modeling was used to test the predictive role of personality in EI. Personality was found to be a predictor of EI in older people, and the weight of the prediction was significant in all the dimensions of the big five personality factors, except the dimension of neuroticism, which is known to vary greatly during the aging process. These results indicate …
9582322	Complex interactions of the protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase and calmodulin revealed with the yeast two-hybrid system.	aging	1998-05-22	The widely distributed protein-L-isoaspartyl, D-aspartyl carboxylmethyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) is hypothesized to play a role in the repair or metabolism of deamidated and isomerized proteins that are spontaneously generated during the aging of proteins in cells. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that potentially interact with the methyltransferase in a cellular processing pathway. Two cDNAs, both encoding calmodulin, were isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library using the human methyltransferase as the bait. Enzymatic assays with purified components revealed a complex set of interactions between the methyltransferase and calmodulin. Calmodulin weakly stimulated protein carboxylmethyltransferase activity in vitro at concentrations of the two proteins reflecting their representation in mammalian brain. Calmodulin stimulation of methyltransferase was observed in both the presence and absence of calcium, although the effect was greater in the presence of ca…
28341162	Structural laterality is associated with cognitive and mood outcomes: An assessment of 105 healthy aged volunteers.	aging	2017-??-??	The human brain presents multiple asymmetries that dynamically change throughout life. These phenomena have been associated with cognitive impairments and psychiatric disorders although possible associations with specific patterns of cognitive aging are yet to be determined. We have therefore mapped and quantified morphological asymmetries in a heterogeneous and aged population (65.2±8.0 years old, 52 male and 53 female) to explore potential associations between the asymmetries in specific brain regions and cognitive performance. The sample was characterized in a battery of neuropsychological tests and in terms of brain structural asymmetries using a ROI-based approach. A substantial number of brain areas presented some degree of asymmetry. Such biases survived a stringent statistical correction and were largely confirmed in a voxel-based analysis. In specific brain areas, like the thalamus and insula, asymmetry was correlated with cognition and mood descriptors as the Stroop words/col…
9242962	Minimal oxidation and storage of low density lipoproteins result in an increased susceptibility to phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase A2.	aging	1997-07-25	In vitro-studies have shown that phospholipid hydrolysis of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by bee venom or porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) leads to an increased uptake of these lipoproteins by macrophages transforming them into foam cells. Recently, a secretory phospholipase A2, group II, was detected in human atherosclerotic plaques. In order to investigate the role of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a structurally identical human secretory PLA2 was purified from the medium of HepG2 cells stimulated with interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The activity of the purified enzyme towards the phospholipids of native and modified low density lipoproteins was compared with the activity towards Escherichia coli-membranes and other phospholipid substrates. Compared to E. coli-membranes, native LDL proved to be a poor substrate for group II PLA2. After mild oxidation induced by copper ions or by 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) (AAPH), the susceptibility of …
6865496	DNA chain growth as a function of age in intact and permeabilized WI-38 and MRC-5 cells.	aging	1983-01-??	The rate of incorporation of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) into acid-precipitable material of permeabilized MRC-5 and WI-38 cells as well as the rate of DNA chain growth in both intact and permeabilized cells was examined as a function of cell age. Although both the total rate of dTTP incorporation and the percentage of labeled cells decreased as cultures aged, we could detect no decrease in the rate of DNA chain growth from passages 29 to 53 for MRC-5 and from passages 34 to 50 for WI-38 cells. Since the older passages were in phase III growth and since, in our hands, the WI-38 cells used for this study senesced at passage 51, we conclude that a decrease in the rate of DNA chain growth is not related to in vitro aging.
15763394	Resistance exercise training decreases oxidative damage to DNA and increases cytochrome oxidase activity in older adults.	aging	2005-03-??	Regular resistance exercise increases muscle strength and induces muscle fibre hypertrophy in older adults. Although the underlying causes of aging remain unclear, like acute exercise, aging is associated with oxidative stress. In ageing, however, oxidative stress is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction as proposed by the mitochondrial theory of aging. The effect of regular resistance exercise upon mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in older adults is unknown. Twenty-eight older men and women (approximately 68.5+/-5.1 yr) performed whole-body resistance exercise training for 14 weeks. Muscle biopsies were taken before and 72 h following the last exercise bout from the vastus lateralis. Urine samples were also taken at the time of tissue collection. Resistance exercise training was associated with a decrease in 8-OHdG (Pre: 10783+/-5856, Post: 8897+/-4030 ng g(-1) creatinine; p<0.05). Protein content for CuZnSOD, MnSOD, and catalase, and enzyme activities for citra…
19942987	Growth hormone secretion in response to glucagon stimulation test in healthy middle-aged men.	aging	2009-10-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the growth hormone (GH) response to glucagon stimulation test (GST) in a population of healthy men over 50 years old in comparison to insulin tolerance test (ITT), analysis of the spontaneous 24-hour GH profile and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I).    METHODS: 27 healthy men aged between 51 and 65 years were tested.    RESULTS: Using non-parametric correlation analysis, a positive correlation between GH peak after GST and mean IGF-I (r = 0.528; p = 0.005) was found, as well with GH peak in 24-hour profile (r = 0.494; p = 0.009). No correlation was found comparing GH peak after ITT with the same parameters. Ten subjects presented GH peak of less than 3.0 microg/L after GST, none confirmed in ITT.    CONCLUSIONS: GH peak response to GST was lower than ITT, but it showed a positive correlation with mean IGF-I and also with GH peak in 24-hour profile. However, GST should not be used to differentiate organic growth hormone deficiency (GDH) from the expected dec…
1962558	Ascorbic acid and oxidative inactivation of proteins.	aging	1991-??-??	A number of active oxygen species are likely implicated in the etiology or manifestation of several pathological conditions, including aging, arthritis, carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. Ascorbate plays a key role in protecting cells against oxidative damage. Paradoxically, in the presence of Fe3+ or Cu2+, ascorbate can promote the generation of the same reactive oxygen species (.OH, O2-, H2O2, and ferryl ion) it is known to destroy. This prooxidant activity derives from the ability of ascorbate to reduce Fe3+ or Cu2+ to Fe2+ or Cu+, respectively, and to reduce O2 to O2-. and H2O2. Damage to nucleic acid and proteins results from the binding of either Fe2+ or Cu+ to metal binding sites on these macromolecules followed by reaction of the metal complexes with H2O2; this leads to the production of active oxygen species that attack functional groups at or near the metal binding sites.
19729591	Cerebral blood flow during exercise: mechanisms of regulation.	aging	2009-11-??	The response of cerebral vasculature to exercise is different from other peripheral vasculature; it has a small vascular bed and is strongly regulated by cerebral autoregulation and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa(CO(2))). In contrast to other organs, the traditional thinking is that total cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains relatively constant and is largely unaffected by a variety of conditions, including those imposed during exercise. Recent research, however, indicates that cerebral neuronal activity and metabolism drive an increase in CBF during exercise. Increases in exercise intensity up to approximately 60% of maximal oxygen uptake produce elevations in CBF, after which CBF decreases toward baseline values because of lower Pa(CO(2)) via hyperventilation-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that, during heavy exercise, CBF decreases despite the cerebral metabolic demand. In contrast, this reduced CBF during heavy exercise lowers cerebral ox…
12181313	Telomere-binding protein TRF2 binds to and stimulates the Werner and Bloom syndrome helicases.	aging	2002-10-25	Werner syndrome is a human premature aging disorder displaying cellular defects associated with telomere maintenance including genomic instability, premature senescence, and accelerated telomere erosion. The yeast homologue of the Werner protein (WRN), Sgs1, is required for recombination-mediated lengthening of telomeres in telomerase-deficient cells. In human cells, we report that WRN co-localizes and physically interacts with the critical telomere maintenance protein TRF2. This interaction is mediated by the RecQ conserved C-terminal region of WRN. In vitro, TRF2 demonstrates high affinity for WRN and for another RecQ family member, the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM). TRF2 interaction with either WRN or BLM results in a notable stimulation of their helicase activities. Furthermore, the WRN and BLM helicases, partnered with replication protein A, actively unwind long telomeric duplex regions that are pre-bound by TRF2. These results suggest that TRF2 functions with WRN, and possibly BLM…
28427051	Subjective Time Perceptions and Aging Well: A Review of Concepts and Empirical Research - A Mini-Review.	lifespan	2017-??-??	Human beings impose subjective, time-related interpretations on their existence, and the experience of time is a major aspect of lifespan development. In this mini-review, we understand subjective time as the way individuals subjectively perceive and evaluate the passing of their personal "objective" lifetime. A broad range of constructs and operationalizations has been developed in (gero-) psychology to capture subjective time, including future time perspective, personal goals, or autobiographical memories. In order to theoretically integrate this yet loosely connected body of literature, we propose a conceptual model of subjective time concepts according to 2 dimensions: temporal direction (past, present, future) and thematic field (duration/expansion, time-ordered life content, and time-related evaluations, attitudes, and mindsets). This conceptual model of subjective time perceptions builds the foundation for a review of the empirical literature regarding associations of subjective…
25395345	Staying on Task: Age-Related Changes in the Relationship Between Executive Functioning and Response Time Consistency.	aging	2016-03-??	OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the relationship of executive functioning with age-related increases in response time (RT) distribution indices (intraindividual standard deviation [ISD], and ex-Gaussian parameters mu, sigma, tau). The goals of this study were to (a) replicate findings of age-related changes in response time distribution indices during an engaging touch-screen RT task and (b) investigate age-related changes in the relationship between executive functioning and RT distribution indices.    METHOD: Healthy adults (24 young [aged 18-30], 24 young-old [aged 65-74], and 24 old-old [aged 75-85]) completed a touch-screen attention task and a battery of neuropsychological tests. The relationships between RT performance and executive functions were examined with structural equation modeling (SEM).    RESULTS: ISD, mu, and tau, but not sigma, increased with age. SEM revealed tau as the most salient RT index associated with neuropsychological measures of executive functioning. Fur…
741350	Conservation of genes coding for proteins synthesized in human mitochondria.	aging	1978-11-??	Proteins synthesized in mitochondria of 27 different human cell lines, identified by labeling with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide, have been enumerated and their electrophoretic mobilities determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Twelve bands were observed in all cell lines. In 24 cell lines, the electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins were the same regardless of race, sex, tissue of origin, cell type, viral transformation, or premature biological aging syndromes. The patterns obtained for the remaining cell lines, HeLa, KB, and Hep-2 were identical. These cell lines showed one protein component that was absent in the 24 others, and lacked a component present in these cell lines. Since it has been previously asserted that KB and Hep-2 are HeLa cells, the data indicate that one basic pattern exists in human cells with a variant of unknown origin occurring in HeLa cells.
6434579	Leydig cell numbers, daily sperm production, and serum gonadotropin levels in aging men.	aging	1984-10-??	Age-related changes in Leydig cell number, daily sperm production, and circulating hormone levels were studied in 15 men between 20 and 48 yr of age and 15 men between 50 and 76 yr of age. Testes and blood samples were obtained at autopsy less than 15 h after death due to trauma or heart attack. Leydig cell number was determined by quantitative histometric estimation of the proportion of glutaraldehyde-perfused, decapsulated testicular parenchyma occupied by Leydig cell nuclei of measured average volume in both testes of each subject. Daily sperm production was determined by phase contrast cytometry of round spermatid nuclei in homogenates of both fixed testes from each individual. LH, FSH, PRL, and testosterone in serum from the heart or large veins were quantified by RIA. No relationship was detected between any of the testicular or hormonal values and postmortem time. The average total number of Leydig cells was reduced by 44% in the older men and was negatively correlated with age …
23273985	The aging oocyte--can mitochondrial function be improved?	aging	2013-01-??	In recent years, social and cultural trends have resulted in women delaying childbirth, thereby leading to reproductive senescence as a growing public health problem. We discuss potential etiologies for age-related female reproductive decline. We bring supportive evidence to the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxygen radicals in the process of aging in general and reproductive senescence specifically. We also explore the role of coenzyme Q10 deficiency as a contributing factor and the effects of its administration.
28434424	An investigation of residential facility staff usage of touchscreen technology.	aging	2017-??-??	Older adults may become more familiar and interested in using touchscreen technology (TT). TT can be used to engage older adults living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) and staff there can play an important role in supporting residents to use TT. However, before these are introduced, it is crucial to investigate their opinions in using TT with residents. A questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model was administered to assess staff usage and confidence in using TT, their perceptions in TT ease-of-use and usefulness in helping them care for their residents. Perhaps unsurprisingly, results found that respondents were familiar using TT. More importantly, staff reported that they were interested in engaging residents with TT and nominated different training methods to support them such as group in-services. This project provides information about staff experience and acceptance of the use of TT for residents in RACFs.
14534320	Werner syndrome protein contains three structure-specific DNA binding domains.	aging	2003-12-26	Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging syndrome caused by mutations in the WS gene (WRN) and a deficiency in the function of the Werner protein (WRN). WRN is a multifunctional nuclear protein that catalyzes three DNA-dependent reactions: a 3'-5'-exonuclease, an ATPase, and a 3'-5'-helicase. Deficiency in WRN results in a cellular phenotype of genomic instability. The biochemical characteristics of WRN and the cellular phenotype of WRN mutants suggest that WRN plays an important role in DNA metabolic pathways such as recombination, transcription, replication, and repair. The catalytic activities of WRN have been extensively studied and are fairly well understood. However, much less is known about the domain-specific interactions between WRN and its DNA substrates. This study identifies and characterizes three distinct WRN DNA binding domains using recombinant truncated fragments of WRN and five DNA substrates (long forked duplex, blunt-ended duplex, single-stranded DNA, 5'-overhang d…
31122239	Engaging 'hard to reach' groups in health promotion: the views of older people and professionals from a qualitative study in England.	aging	2019-05-23	BACKGROUND: Older people living in deprived areas, from black and minority ethnic groups (BME) or aged over 85 years (oldest old) are recognised as 'hard to reach'. Engaging these groups in health promotion is of particular importance when seeking to target those who may benefit the most and to reduce health inequalities. This study aimed to explore what influences them practicing health promotion and elicit the views of cross-sector professionals with experiences of working with 'hard to reach' older people, to help inform best practice on engagement.    METHODS: 'Hard to reach' older people were recruited through primary care by approaching those not attending for preventative healthcare, and via day centres. Nineteen participated in an interview (n = 15) or focus group (n = 4); including some overlaps: 17 were from a deprived area, 12 from BME groups, and five were oldest old. Cross-sector health promotion professionals across England with experience of health promotion with older p…
10648276	Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged &gt;/=90 y.	aging	2000-02-??	BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells play a role in natural immunity against tumor and infected cells. Advanced aging is associated with functional impairment of NK cells and increased susceptibility to nutritional deficiencies.    OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test whether micronutrient status affects NK cell activity in an older population.    DESIGN: The relations between NK cell variables (percentage of leukocytes and cytotoxicity) and blood concentrations of selected micronutrients were studied in 62 healthy, free-living northern Italian subjects (25 men, 37 women) aged 90-106 y. Anthropometric measurements were also made.    RESULTS: All subjects were well nourished according to age-specific anthropometric norms but many of them had micronutrient deficiencies. The prevalence of micronutrient deficiency was highest for selenium (in approximately 50% of both sexes), zinc (in 52% of men and 41% of women), and vitamin B-6 (in 40% of men and 59% of women), followed by vitamin A (in…
24428552	Understanding epigenetic changes in aging stem cells--a computational model approach.	aging	2014-04-??	During aging, a decline in stem cell function is observed in many tissues. This decline is accompanied by complex changes of the chromatin structure among them changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation which both affect transcription of a tissue-specific subset of genes. A mechanistic understanding of these age-associated processes, their interrelations and environmental dependence is currently lacking. Here, we discuss related questions on the molecular, cellular, and population level. We combine an individual cell-based model of stem cell populations with a model of epigenetic regulation of transcription. The novel model enables to simulate age-related changes of trimethylation of lysine 4 at histone H3 and of DNA methylation. These changes entail expression changes of genes that induce age-related phenotypes (ARPs) of cells. We compare age-related changes of regulatory states in quiescent stem cells occupying a niche with those observed in proliferating cells. Moreover, w…
11164474	The effects of carnosine on oxidative DNA damage levels and in vitro lifespan in human peripheral blood derived CD4+T cell clones.	longevity, lifespan	2000-12-20	Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), an abundant naturally-occurring dipeptide has been shown to exhibit anti-ageing properties towards cultured cells, possibly due in part to its antioxidant/free radical scavenging abilities. In this paper the results of an investigation on the effects of carnosine, at the physiological concentration of 20 mM, on oxidative DNA damage levels and in vitro lifespan in peripheral blood derived human CD4+ T cell clones are reported. Under the culture conditions used (20% O(2)) long term culture with carnosine resulted in a significant increase in the lifespan of a clone derived from a healthy young subject. No such extension was observed when a T cell clone from a healthy old SENIEUR donor was similarly cultured. Culture with carnosine from the midpoint of each clone's lifespan did not have any effect on longevity, independent of donor age. Oxidative DNA damage levels were measured in the clones at various points in their lifespans. Carnosine acted as a we…
29196110	Degradation of tropoelastin and skin elastin by neprilysin.	aging	2018-03-??	Neprilysin is also known as skin fibroblast-derived elastase, and its up-regulation during aging is associated with impairments of the elastic fiber network, loss of skin elasticity and wrinkle formation. However, information on its elastase activity is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the degradation of fibrillar skin elastin by neprilysin and the influence of the donor's age on the degradation process using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approaches. The results showed that cleavage by neprilysin is dependent on previous damage of elastin. While neprilysin does not cleave young and intact skin elastin well, it degrades elastin fibers from older donors, which may further promote aging processes. With regards to the cleavage behavior of neprilysin, a strong preference for Gly at P1 was found, while Gly, Ala and Val were well accepted at P1' upon cleavage of tropoelastin and skin elastin. The results of the study indicate that the progressive release of bioac…
10619318	Factors associated with brain donation among optimally healthy elderly people.	aging	1999-11-??	BACKGROUND: Consent rates for brain donation were examined in 140 healthy elderly participants of the Oregon Brain Aging Study, a longitudinal study of successful aging. Subjects were initially selected for good health. The study population had a relatively high education level, a high socioeconomic status, and were predominantly white.    METHODS: At each annual examination, a project physician asked participants to consider brain donation. This analysis examined variables that may affect the rate of brain donation consent: age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, marital status, religiosity, cognitive status, depression, and functional status.    RESULTS: Of these variables only age was a meaningful factor.    CONCLUSION: The oldest old participants (> or =85 years of age) were more likely to consent to donation than the younger participants (65-84 years of age).
10433449	Bone mineral density in the distal radius in a healthy Japanese population and in relation to fractures of the distal radius.	aging	1999-06-??	Changes in bone mineral density with age were measured in the distal radius of healthy adults using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 2789 healthy women (20-95 years old) and 1255 healthy men (20-87 years old), and 72 women (52-94 years old) and 23 men (51-79 years old) with fractures of the distal radius were assessed. Bone mineral density remains relatively stable in men despite aging, and was significantly higher than in women in every decade. In women aged 70 years and more, the bone mineral density was significantly lower in the fracture group than the non-fracture group. In men with fractures of the distal radius, there were no significant differences between bone mineral density and age. In the fracture groups loss of radial inclination after reduction correlated with decreased bone mineral density, but there was no significant regression between bone mineral density and the decrease in radial length or palmar tilt.
6328135	Prolylhydroxylase activation in IMR 90 fibroblasts: state of differentiation rather than population doubling level determines requirements for enzyme activation.	aging	????-??-??	The stimulation of prolylhydroxylase activity by ascorbate in IMR 90 fibroblasts grown as monolayer decreases with increasing population doubling level, but the enzyme is not stimulated in IMR 90 fibroblasts of either low or high population doubling level incorporated into collagen lattices in which they cease to divide. The capacity to be activated is restored when cells are released from the lattice. We consider that reduction of stimulation of prolylhydroxylase activity by ascorbate as the population doubling level of cells grown as monolayer increases is not a phenomenon of cell aging. Rather, it is due to an increase in the size of the noncycling subpopulation whose state of differentiation is not the same as that of cells in cycle.
19650676	Morphine glucuronidation in preterm neonates, infants and children younger than 3 years.	aging	2009-??-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A considerable amount of drug use in children is still unlicensed or off-label. In order to derive rational dosing schemes, the influence of aging on glucuronidation capacity in newborns, including preterms, infants and children under the age of 3 years was studied using morphine and its major metabolites as a model drug.    METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed with the nonlinear mixed-effects modelling software NONMEM V, on the basis of 2159 concentrations of morphine and its glucuronides from 248 infants receiving intravenous morphine ranging in bodyweight from 500 g to 18 kg (median 2.8 kg). The model was internally validated using normalized prediction distribution errors.    RESULTS: Formation clearances of morphine to its glucuronides and elimination clearances of the glucuronides were found to be primarily influenced by bodyweight, which was parameterized using an allometric equation with an estimated exponential scaling factor of 1…
24224044	Grey matter correlates of three language tests in non-demented older adults.	aging	2013-??-??	Language has been extensively investigated by functional neuroimaging studies. However, only a limited number of structural neuroimaging studies have examined the relationship between language performance and brain structure in healthy adults, and the number is even less in older adults. The present study sought to investigate correlations between grey matter volumes and three standardized language tests in late life. The participants were 344 non-demented, community-dwelling adults aged 70-90 years, who were drawn from the population-based Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. The three language tests included the Controlled Oral Word Association Task (COWAT), Category Fluency (CF), and Boston Naming Test (BNT). Correlation analyses between voxel-wise GM volumes and language tests showed distinctive GM correlation patterns for each language test. The GM correlates were located in the right frontal and left temporal lobes for COWAT, in the left frontal and temporal lobes for CF, and in bilat…
25224364	Influence of aging process on the bioactive components and antioxidant activity of ginseng (Panax ginseng L.).	aging	2014-10-??	The effects of aging process on the ginsenosides and antioxidant activity of ginseng was investigated. Fresh ginseng roots were aged in oven at 70 or 80 °C for 7, 14, 21, or 28 d. Their ginsenosides, phenolics, and antioxidant activity were analyzed. Ginseng aged at 80 °C for 14 d exhibited the highest amounts of total saponins and phenolics. It also showed markedly higher free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and ferrous ion chelating ability than the other aged ginsengs. The ginsenosides Rb1 , Rb3 , Rg3 , Re, Rg1 , and Rg2 were generated during aging. The Rg2 was the most abundant ginsenoside in aged ginseng, with samples treated at 80 °C for 14 d having the highest amount. These findings provide the first evidence that aging, particularly at 80 °C for 14 d, could increase the bioactive compounds, indicating that this heating process may be useful in enhancing the biological activity of ginseng. PRACTICALAPPLICATION: Ginseng has long been recognized for its various health…
20566734	Molecular adaptations to aerobic exercise training in skeletal muscle of older women.	aging	2010-11-??	BACKGROUND: We have recently shown that 12 weeks of progressive aerobic exercise training improves whole-muscle size and function in older women. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate molecular markers that may be associated with muscle hypertrophy after aerobic training in aging skeletal muscle.    METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training on a cycle ergometer in nine older women (70 ± 2 years) to determine basal levels of messenger RNA and protein content of select myogenic, proteolytic, and mitochondrial factors.    RESULTS: The training program increased (p < .05) aerobic capacity 30 ± 9%, whole-muscle cross-sectional area 11 ± 2%, and whole-muscle force production 29 ± 8%. Basal messenger RNA levels of FOXO3A, myostatin, HSP70, and MRF4 were lower (p < .05) after aerobic training. FOXO3A, FOXO3A phosphorylation, and HSP70 protein content were unaltered after training. Mitochondrial protein COX IV was elevated (p < .05…
6973469	CMRO2 and CBF by the oxygen-15 inhalation technique. Results in normal volunteers and cerebrovascular patients.	aging	1981-??-??	The oxygen-15 inhalation technique has been applied to the quantitation of regional CBF, CMRO2 and OER with positron emission tomography. The introduction of corrections for gamma-ray attenuation, and for recirculation, has allowed us to obtain values for CBF, CMRO2 and OER in close agreement with values obtained using other techniques. In 27 normal volunteers mean CMRO2 shows values ranging from 4.98 to 3.79 ml/100/min, depending on the region evaluated. Mean CBF values range from 55.3 to 38.8 ml/100ml/min. Mean OER is more constant, ranging from 0.56 to 0.49, with a mean of 0.53 +/- 0.04, thus reflecting the close matching between metabolism and blood supply. We have further identified corrections for cerebral blood volume, which is measurable, and for water partition coefficient, which remains uncertain. In preliminary studies these corrections decrease the OER over the physiological range of flow by 10%, with a 15% lower CMRO2. The reproducibility of the results and the effects of …
29979108	An epigenetic pacemaker is detected via a fast conditional expectation maximization algorithm.	aging	2018-??-??	AIM: DNA methylation has proven to be a remarkably accurate biomarker for human age, allowing the prediction of chronological age to within a couple of years. Recently, we proposed that the Universal PaceMaker (UPM), a flexible paradigm for modeling evolution, could be applied to epigenetic aging. Nevertheless, application to real data was restricted to small datasets for technical limitations.    MATERIALS & METHODS: We partition the set of variables into to two subsets and optimize the likelihood function on each set separately. This yields an extremely efficient Conditional Expectation Maximization algorithm, alternating between the two sets while increasing the overall likelihood.    RESULTS: Using the technique, we could reanalyze datasets of larger magnitude and show significant advantage to the UPM approach.    CONCLUSION: The UPM more faithfully models epigenetic aging than the time linear approach while methylated sites accelerate and decelerate jointly.
16107709	Cooperation of the Cockayne syndrome group B protein and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in the response to oxidative stress.	aging	2005-09-??	Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized as a segmental premature-aging syndrome. The CS group B (CSB) protein has previously been implicated in transcription-coupled repair, transcriptional elongation, and restoration of RNA synthesis after DNA damage. Recently, evidence for a role of CSB in base excision repair of oxidative DNA lesions has accumulated. In our search to understand the molecular function of CSB in this process, we identify a physical and functional interaction between CSB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 is a nuclear enzyme that protects the integrity of the genome by responding to oxidative DNA damage and facilitating DNA repair. PARP-1 binds to single-strand DNA breaks which activate the catalytic ability of PARP-1 to add polymers of ADP-ribose to various proteins. We find that CSB is present at sites of activated PARP-1 after oxidative stress, identify CSB as a new substrate of PARP-1, and demonstrate that poly(ADP-ribosyl)at…
15941712	Alpha-synuclein alters proteasome function, protein synthesis, and stationary phase viability.	aging	2005-08-26	Alpha-synuclein appears to play a role in mediating neurotoxicity in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as synucleinopathies. Most of these disorders are associated with aging and a probable impairment of the proteasome-proteolytic pathway, although the relationship between aging, proteasome inhibition, and alpha-synuclein toxicity has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggest that yeast may provide a useful system for studying the biology and toxicity of alpha-synuclein in mitotic cells, recapitulating many features observed in the various synucleinopathy disorders. Additional studies indicate that the stationary phase model of aging in yeast provides a useful system for understanding the biochemistry and regulation of aging in post-mitotic cells. In the present study we examined the effect of wild type and mutant alpha-synuclein (A30P) on multiple aspects of proteasome homeostasis, protein synthesis, as well as the ability of cells to survive st…
25310220	A behavioral mechanism of how increases in leg strength improve old adults' gait speed.	aging	2014-??-??	We examined a behavioral mechanism of how increases in leg strength improve healthy old adults' gait speed. Leg press strength training improved maximal leg press load 40% (p = 0.001) and isometric strength in 5 group of leg muscles 32% (p = 0.001) in a randomly allocated intervention group of healthy old adults (age 74, n = 15) but not in no-exercise control group (age 74, n = 8). Gait speed increased similarly in the training (9.9%) and control (8.6%) groups (time main effect, p = 0.001). However, in the training group only, in line with the concept of biomechanical plasticity of aging gait, hip extensors and ankle plantarflexors became the only significant predictors of self-selected and maximal gait speed. The study provides the first behavioral evidence regarding a mechanism of how increases in leg strength improve healthy old adults' gait speed.
2658088	Oxidative hemoglobin denaturation and RBC destruction: the effect of heme on red cell membranes.	aging	1989-04-??	In this article, we have reviewed evidence to indicate that hemoglobin denaturation can cause sufficient membrane damage to contribute to red cell destruction. We have attempted to explain how hemoglobin denaturation may affect red cell membrane properties at the molecular level. Current information is consistent with the possibility that hemin, in addition to Heinz bodies, is an important factor contributing to red cell membrane damage following hemoglobin denaturation. The initial step in hemin-induced membrane damage appears to involve the oxidation of membrane protein sulfhydryl groups as well as lipids. Structural and functional membrane properties are likely to be altered. Further studies on the role of hemin in the process of red cell aging and in the pathophysiology of red cell disorders characterized by hemoglobin oxidation should yield new information regarding the role of hemin in these conditions.
29032489	Away from the Islands: Diaspora's Effects on Native Hawaiian Elders and Families in California.	aging	2017-12-??	Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawai'i, were once a healthy and hardy people. But today they are affected by varying social and health disparities that have led to poor social and health outcomes. Most of the research on Hawaiians in general and Native Hawaiian elders in particular has been conducted in Hawai'i, even though the Hawaiian Diaspora has resulted in 45% of this population residing in North America and Alaska. This qualitative study used key informant interviews and focus group methods to examine reasons for migration and perspectives on aging and caregiving in a sample of Native Hawaiian elders and family caregivers residing in Southern California. Findings identified three general themes: discrimination was a factor in their migration from Hawai'i; similarly to non-Hawaiians, they are concerned about challenges associated with aging and caregiving; and Native Hawaiian cultural traditions and values continue to shape their caregiving and service preferences.
21674282	Working memory in the oldest-old: evidence from output serial position curves.	aging	2011-11-??	In the present study, we examined adult age differences in short-term and working memory performance in middle-aged (45-64 years), young-old (65-74 years), old-old (75-89 years), and oldest-old adults (90 years and over) in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study. Previous research suggests that measures of working memory are more sensitive to age effects than are simple tests of short-term memory Bopp and Verhaeghen (Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences 60:223-233, 2005), Myerson, Emery, White, and Hale, (Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition 10:20-27, 2003). To test this hypothesis, we examined output serial position curves of recall data from three span tasks: forward and backward digit span and size judgment span. Participants' recall patterns in the size judgment span task revealed that the two oldest groups of adults showed the largest decreases in recall performance across output serial positions, but did not differ significantly from each other. Correlation analyses indicat…
7087415	Voice onset time in normal-aged population.	aging	1982-03-??	Evidence suggests that the fine motor coordinations required to maintain the articulatory-laryngeal adjustments represented by measures of voice onset time (VOT) should change as a function of normal aging. This descriptive study obtained measures of VOT in healthy elderly subjects as a basis for extending the model of temporal speech control to the later years. Three groups of 10 subjects each were used. Group I was composed of subjects 25-39 years old. Groups 2 and 3 included subjects aged 65-74, and over 75, respectively. Subjects produced 30 tokens of three stimulus words, beat, pete, bead, following a carrier phrase. Wide-band spectrograms were prepared and measured, and the VOT data analyzed statistically. The following conclusions were drawn with respect to mean group age. The means of the VOTs did not differ significantly across subject groups. Standard deviations in the means did differ significantly, variability increased with age, both within subjects and between groups. The…
3878247	Discrepancy in the expression of autoantibodies in healthy aged individuals.	aging	1985-05-??	Sera from 50 healthy old subjects and from 51 young controls were tested by ELISA assays for a panel of autoantibodies, including IgM RF, anti-DNA, anti-F(ab')2, antithyroglobulin, anti-human albumin, anti-human hemoglobin, anti-secretory component from human IgA, and anti-gliadin. In vitro production of anti-DNA as well as anti-F(ab')2 antibodies were measured after stimulation of PBMC by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in 12 healthy elderly subjects and 11 young controls. Sera from elderly donors contained threefold higher amounts of IgM RF than young controls (P less than 0.001). On the contrary, the levels of anti-DNA as well as anti-F(ab')2 antibodies were similar in both groups (P less than 0.3 for the two determinations). Anti-DNA and anti-F(ab')2 antibodies were also measured in supernates of PWM-stimulated glass nonadherent PBMC cultures from both old and young healthy donors without finding any significant difference between the two groups. Additional ELISA tests were also performed i…
23813527	The influence of training status, age, and muscle fiber type on cycling efficiency and endurance performance.	aging	2013-09-01	The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of age, training status, and muscle fiber-type distribution on cycling efficiency. Forty men were recruited into one of four groups: young and old trained cyclists, and young and old untrained individuals. All participants completed an incremental ramp test to measure their peak O2 uptake, maximal heart rate, and maximal minute power output; a submaximal test of cycling gross efficiency (GE) at a series of absolute and relative work rates; and, in trained participants only, a 1-h cycling time trial. Finally, all participants underwent a muscle biopsy of their right vastus lateralis muscle. At relative work rates, a general linear model found significant main effects of age and training status on GE (P < 0.01). The percentage of type I muscle fibers was higher in the trained groups (P < 0.01), with no difference between age groups. There was no relationship between fiber type and cycling efficiency at any work rate or cadence combina…
28935148	Effect of physical activity and age on plasma copper, zinc, iron, and magnesium concentration in physically active healthy males.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVES: The concentration of nutritionally important minerals in circulation is under tight homeostatic control, however, physical activity and aging influence their body stores and nutritional requirement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of both physical activity and age on plasma concentrations of copper, zinc, iron, and magnesium.    METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling was used for selection of study participants (N = 360) belonging to three physical activity groups: sedentary, moderately active, and highly active on the basis of their physical activity levels as 1.53, 1.8, and 2.3, respectively. They were also divided into six different age groups (18-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, and 41-45 y). We assessed nutritional status by determining their body composition using bioelectrical impedance method and measuring intake levels. Fasting blood samples were taken to separate plasma for analysis of copper, zinc, magnesium, and iron.    RESULTS: There was a major …
22583111	Design of an interactive digital nutritional education package for elderly people.	aging	2012-12-??	Designing a system for the elderly is crucial, as aging is associated with physiological changes that may impair perception, cognition and other social aspects; therefore, many aspects need consideration, especially in interface design. This study was conducted to develop a digital nutritional education package (WE Sihat) by following appropriate guidelines for elderly people to achieve better design interface and interaction. Touch-screen technology was used as a platform for user interaction. The nutritional content was based on previous nutrition studies and a lifestyle education package on healthy aging, which contains four modules. The questionnaires were distributed to 31 Malay subjects aged 60-76 years old, containing an evaluation about the overall content, graphics, design layout, colour, font size, audio/video, user-perceived satisfaction and acceptance levels. The findings showed positive feedback and acceptance. Most subjects agreed that the digital nutritional education pa…
24142218	The association between the functional incapacity of the older adult and the family caregiver's burden.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To identify the association between the older adult's functional capacity and the caregiver's burden.    METHOD: A cross-sectional, quantitative study, undertaken in a municipality in the north of the Brazilian state of Paraná, with 178 older adults with functional incapacity, and their caregivers. The Functional Independence Measure was used for evaluating the older adults' functional capacity, and the Zarit Burden Interview was used for evaluating the caregiver burden, with the results being analyzed quantitatively. The majority of the older adults were females, widowed, with a mean age of 79.9 years old, and needing assistance for up to 50% of the daily living tasks. The majority of the caregivers were females, daughters, married, and had a mean age of 56.7 years old.    RESULT: The majority of the caregivers reported moderate burden; the men presented higher probabilities of lower burden than the women; and the more independent the older adult was, the higher the probabi…
23289887	Co-relationships between glandular salivary flow rates and dental caries.	aging	2014-09-??	OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the relationship of age, gender, ethnicity and salivary flow rates on dental caries in an adult population using data collected from the Oral Health San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (OH: SALSA).    BACKGROUND: Saliva is essential to maintain a healthy oral environment and diminished output can result in dental caries. Although gender and age play a role in the quantity of saliva, little is known about the interaction of age, gender and ethnicity on dental caries and salivary flow rates.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the 1147 participants in the OH: SALSA were analysed. The dependent variables were the number of teeth with untreated coronal caries, number of teeth with root caries and the number of coronal and root surfaces with untreated caries. The independent variables were stimulated and unstimulated glandular salivary flow rates along with the age, sex and ethnicity (e.g. European or Mexican ancestry) of the participants. …
23399343	Association between elder abuse and use of ED: findings from the Chicago Health and Aging Project.	aging	2013-04-??	PURPOSE: This study aims to quantify the relationship between overall elder abuse and specific subtypes of elder abuse and rate of emergency department (ED) utilization in a community-dwelling population.    METHODS: A population-based study is conducted in Chicago of community-dwelling older adults who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Of the 6674 participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, 106 participants were reported to a social services agency for suspected elder abuse. The primary predictor was elder abuse reported to a social services agency. The outcome of interest was the annual rate of ED utilization obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Poisson regression models were used to assess these longitudinal relationships.    RESULTS: The average annual rate of ED visits for those without elder abuse was 0.7(1.4) and, for those with reported elder abuse, was 2.1(3.2). After adjusting for sociodemographics, socioeconomic variables…
28438051	Similarity of female central (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism and postmenopause.	aging	2017-08-??	OBJECTIVES: Central (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism in women could be a cause of persistent amenorrhea and hypoestrogenemia as observed in postmenopause. This study aimed to compare the clinical, hormonal and biochemical features in women with non-physiological (central hypogonadism) and physiological (postmenopause) hypoestrogenemia.    METHODS: A total of 161 young women, median age 24.9 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21.2; 30.5) with central hypogonadism (with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, n = 76, and with hypopituitarism, n = 85), 53 healthy young women, median age 23.9 years (IQR 23.1; 28.0) and 50 healthy postmenopausal women, median age 56.0 years (IQR 53.1; 58.5), were examined. Psychoemotional, neurovegetative and urogenital symptoms, sex steroid levels, parameters of lipid and mineral metabolism were evaluated.    RESULTS: In young women with central hypogonadism, the frequencies of psychoemotional, neurovegetative and urogenital complaints differed significantly …
2539109	The effect of in vitro and in vivo cellular aging on the active calcium transport in human inside-out red cell membrane vesicles.	aging	1989-03-15	Modelling of the in vivo and in vitro aging processes in the human red cell has stressed the following features of the active calcium uptake by inside-out vesicles: 1) it is higher in the outdated, in vitro aged, than in the fresh red cell (p less than 0.0005), and in the densest, in vivo aged fraction than in the lightest, young fraction (p = 0.08); 2) it increases following stimulation by excess calmodulin to values that are not significantly different; 3) it decreases to the same value in the absence of endogenous calmodulin and inhibitor, with and without exogenous calmodulin; 4) it is the target of a non-competitive inhibition, that is stronger in the fresh than in the outdated red cell. We conclude that the aging process does not involve neither membrane Ca-ATPase nor calmodulin, but rather the interaction of the calcium pump with the inhibitor of Ca-ATPase.
24023728	Inhibitory effect of metformin and pyridoxamine in the formation of early, intermediate and advanced glycation end-products.	aging	2013-??-??	BACKGROUND: Non-enzymatic glycation is the addition of free carbonyl group of reducing sugar to the free amino groups of proteins, resulting in the formation of a Schiff base and an Amadori product. Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) is one of the carbonyl species which reacts rapidly with the free amino groups of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The highly reactive dihydroxyacetone phosphate is a derivative of dihydroxyacetone (DHA), and a product of glycolysis, having potential glycating effects to form AGEs. The formation of AGEs results in the generation of free radicals which play an important role in the pathophysiology of aging and diabetic complications. While the formation of DHA-AGEs has been demonstrated previously, no extensive studies have been performed to assess the inhibition of AGE inhibitors at all the three stages of glycation (early, intermediate and late) using metformin (MF) and pyridoxamine (PM) as a novel inhibitor.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:…

22860480	Promoting awareness of LGBT issues in aging in a baccalaureate nursing program.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	It is estimated that up to 10 percent of the American population is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) and that up to 7 million members of this population are elderly. Both the Institute of Medicine and Healthy People 2020 have addressed the health disparities that affect elderly members of the LGBT community. Nurses are well positioned to bridge health disparities and provide culturally sensitive care across the lifespan, but compared with that of other disciplines, the nursing literature is lacking in content addressing LGBT health. Eliminating health disparities in the care of LGBT elders should be a priority in nursing education.The authors review the issues LGBT elders face and recommend how content related to LGBT aging can be integrated into nursing curricula.
26362110	The effect of oral collagen peptide supplementation on skin moisture and the dermal collagen network: evidence from an ex vivo model and randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.	aging	2015-12-??	BACKGROUND: Skin dryness and an accelerated fragmentation of the collagen network in the dermis are hallmarks of skin aging. Nutrition is a key factor influencing skin health and consequently its appearance. A wide range of dietary supplements is offered to improve skin health. Collagen peptides are used as a bioactive ingredient in nutricosmetic products and have been shown in preclinical studies to improve skin barrier function, to induce the synthesis of collagen and hyaluronic acid, and to promote fibroblast growth and migration. Our aim was to investigate the effect of oral supplementation with specific collagen peptides on skin hydration and the dermal collagen network in a clinical setting.    METHODS: Two placebo-controlled clinical trials were run to assess the effect of a daily oral supplementation with collagen peptides on skin hydration by corneometry, on collagen density by high-resolution ultrasound and on collagen fragmentation by reflectance confocal microscopy. Human s…
24821287	Decline in cognitive function and elder mistreatment: findings from the Chicago Health and Aging Project.	aging	2014-06-??	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between decline in cognitive function and elder mistreatment (EM).    METHODS: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) is an epidemiologic study conducted in a geographically defined community (N = 6,159). We identified 143 CHAP participants who had longitudinal cognitive data and EM reported to social services agency. The primary predictor was cognitive function, which was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (Perceptual Speed), and both immediate and delayed recall of the East Boston Memory Test (Episodic Memory). An index of global cognitive function scores was derived by averaging z scores of all tests. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of cognitive function domains and risk for EM.    RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, every one-point decline in global cognitive function (odds ratio [OR]: 1.57 [1.21-2.03]), MMSE (OR:…
11869426	Spatial organization of EEG activity from alertness to sleep stage 2 in old and younger subjects.	aging	2002-03-??	In order to elucidate brain mechanisms that contribute to the increased tendency for vigilance dysregulation in the elderly, we examined the spatial organization of brain electric activity [electroencephalogram (EEG)] during decreasing vigilance from alertness to onset of sleep stage 2, comparing 7 old and 10 younger, healthy subjects (60-79 and 18-41 years old, respectively). Two features were analyzed: (1) change of location of the brain electric source gravity centers of the EEG frequency bands, and (2) magnitude of fluctuation of these locations over time. Multichannel EEG was analyzed into source gravity center localizations for seven EEG frequency bands, using fast Fourier transform (FFT) Dipole Approximation (first principal component-single source modeling in the frequency domain). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed: source localizations were more anterior in old than younger subjects for beta-1 and more superior for all three beta bands; from alertness to sle…
24732522	Virtual reality as allocentric/egocentric technology for the assessment of cognitive decline in the elderly.	aging	2014-??-??	Wayfinding ability has a high adaptive value, allowing humans to efficiently explore an environment in order to have a goal-oriented activity. This is done thanks to the capacity of individuals to actively acquire knowledge during interaction. Recently, different studies examined the wayfinding performances of older adults in Virtual Reality. While these studies underlined a greater difficulty with the wayfinding task in the elderly subjects, the effects of age on specific aspects of navigational tasks are less well specified. More, a recent study (Konishi &amp; Bohbot, 2013) suggested that older people who use spatial navigational strategies (navigation is achieved by orientating oneself in relation to an allocentic landmark map) in their everyday lives may have increased gray matter in the hippocampus and enhance their probability of healthy and successful aging. To evaluate this hypothesis we tested 176 subjects (from 20 to 89 years old) in wayfinding ability by using an interactive…
7603087	Oxidation state of glutathione and membrane proteins in human red cells of different age.	aging	1995-01-31	In this study the oxidation state of glutathione and membrane proteins was analyzed in red cells of different age in basal conditions. Red cells of different age were prepared by centrifugation and separated according to their density by two procedures: on self-forming gradients of autologous plasma (Murphy's procedure) and on discontinuous Stractan gradients. The efficiency of the two procedures in the isolation of senescent cells was compared. The results indicate that, despite the evidence that total cell GSH decreases with aging, its concentration, evaluated in the cell preparations of different ages, remains constant throughout the red cell life, when correlated with cell water content. Glutathione disulfide concentration increases with aging. The oxidation state of membrane proteins does not seem to change during the red cell life span.
865141	Changes in albumin uptake during the lifespan of human fibroblasts in vitro.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	It has been suggested that a deterioration of cell membrane functions in cell populations with a limited lifespan in vitro could explain the loss of division potential either through changes in permeability of in cell attachment. We analyzed membrane function measuring the uptake of iodinated human serum albumin (125ISA) at different passages during the lifespan in vitro of human adult lung fibroblasts. Monolayers were incubated with 100microng/ml 125ISA. One and sixty minutes later, cultures were washed and the cell bound radioactivity was determined; these values correspond respectively to adsorption and net uptake. Our results show a significant increased uptake of albumin by aging cells. The changes in cell permeability, however, are apparent only late during the life span. Old cultures were also more susceptible to the stimulatory action of polyornithine (PLO) on protein uptake. Results obtained with PLO on young cells showed that the cell takes up more albumin when there is membr…
25884638	Structural effects of protein aging: terminal marking by deamidation in human triosephosphate isomerase.	aging	2015-??-??	Deamidation, the loss of the ammonium group of asparagine and glutamine to form aspartic and glutamic acid, is one of the most commonly occurring post-translational modifications in proteins. Since deamidation rates are encoded in the protein structure, it has been proposed that they can serve as molecular clocks for the timing of biological processes such as protein turnover, development and aging. Despite the importance of this process, there is a lack of detailed structural information explaining the effects of deamidation on the structure of proteins. Here, we studied the effects of deamidation on human triosephosphate isomerase (HsTIM), an enzyme for which deamidation of N15 and N71 has been long recognized as the signal for terminal marking of the protein. Deamidation was mimicked by site directed mutagenesis; thus, three mutants of HsTIM (N15D, N71D and N15D/N71D) were characterized. The results show that the N71D mutant resembles, structurally and functionally, the wild type en…
23999504	Simultaneous ultraviolet B-induced photo-oxidation of tryptophan/tyrosine and racemization of neighboring aspartyl residues in peptides.	aging	2013-12-??	Although proteins consist exclusively of l-amino acids, it is well known that d-isomers of aspartyl (Asp) residues occur at specific sites in lens crystallins of elderly people with cataracts. The presence of d-isomers is thought to result from the racemization of Asp residues in the crystallins during aging. It has been reported that this racemization progresses owing to UV-B exposure; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown because Asp is not a photosensitive residue because there is no aromatic group in its chemical structure. In this study, we synthesized peptides in which the residue neighboring the Asp was the photosensitive residue tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr). After exposing these peptides to UV-B, we used RP-HPLC to confirm that racemization of Asp residues occurred in peptides in which a Trp or Tyr residue was inserted near the Asp; simultaneously, several varieties of photoproducts derived from Trp and Tyr were detected by mass spectroscopy. Promotion of the …
11744339	Underreporting of energy intake in an elderly German population.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVES: Within the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population in Giessen, Germany (GISELA), the underreporters of energy intake (EI) were identified and characterized.    METHODS: EI was assessed in 238 female and 105 male participants of the GISELA study (age range = 60-89 y) by means of a 3-day estimated dietary record developed especially for this study. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry after an overnight fast. EI was expressed as a multiple of RMR and subjects with an EI:RMR ratio below 1.073 were classified as underreporters.    RESULTS: Mean EI:RMR was 1.62 +/- 0.46 in females and 1.53 +/- 0.46 in males; 7.6% of the females and 16.2% of the males were identified as underreporters. They showed lower levels of education and significantly greater body weight, body mass index, and fat mass than the adequate reporters. Further, underreporters stated more often than adequate reporters that they want to lose weight. Exce…
30157786	Eye damage due to cosmetic ultrasound treatment: a case report.	aging	2018-08-29	BACKGROUND: Rejuvenation of aging eyelids is one of cosmetic changes to the individual to create the appearance of youth. Tightening treatment of eyelid by ultrasonic heat could possibly develop acute eye injury, including acute increase of IOP, cataract and rarely myopia.    CASE PRESENTATION: A case report of rejuvenation tightening treatment caused eye injury with 6 months' follow-up. All examinations were performed at a university teaching hospital. A healthy 32-year-old Asian woman had pain, photophobia and blurred vision in the right eye after rejuvenation tightening eye brow treatment. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mmHg in the right eye. Tyndall phenomena were observed. Visual acuity of the right eye dropped to 20/200 (from 20/20), with best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) 20/20. An iris pigment detachment was found.

28763469	End-of-life care for immigrants in Germany. An epidemiological appraisal of Berlin.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Since the late 1950's, a steadily increasing immigrant population in Germany is resulting in a subpopulation of aging immigrants. The German health care system needs to adjust its services-linguistically, culturally, and medically-for this subpopulation of patients. Immigrants make up over 20% of the population in Germany, yet the majority receive inadequate medical care. As many of the labor immigrants of the 1960s and 1970s are in need of hospice and palliative care (HPC), little is known about this specialized care for immigrants. This epidemiological study presents utilization of HPC facilities in Berlin with a focus on different immigrant groups.    METHODS: A validated questionnaire was used to collect data from patients at 34 HPC institutions in Berlin over 20 months. All newly admitted patients were recruited. Anonymized data were coded and analyzed by using SPSS and compared with the population statistics of Berlin.    RESULTS: 4118 questionnaires were completed an…
12353665	Access of reproductive steroids to target tissues.	aging	2002-09-??	The access of reproductive steroids to their target cells varies considerably between tissues, and is influenced to a great extent by their interactions with plasma steroid-binding proteins, and with SHBG and CBG in particular. An increased awareness of how SHBG and CBG function within the blood circulation, and within extravascular compartments of steroid-responsive target tissues, needs to be incorporated into the design and evaluation of therapies involving the administration of both natural and synthetic steroids, which influence female reproduction and healthy aging.
10208255	Intra-individual variation of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in prepubescent children.	aging	1999-04-??	Estimates of the average intra-individual biological variability for plasma lipids and lipoproteins differs substantially among published studies. Moreover, this topic does not appear to have received consideration in exercise and health literature with normal, healthy children as subjects. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine the short-term, day-to-day variability of the lipid-lipoprotein profile from 19 children [mean (SD), 11.5 (0.8) years] from 3 separate venous blood samples. Intra-individual standard deviations, variances and coefficients of variance were determined for total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL-C sub-fractions HDL2 and HDL3, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The intra-individual variation for TC and LDL-C was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP 1991) cut-off points. The main finding was that all of the m…
7025629	Erythrocyte shape transformation associated with calcium accumulation.	lifespan	1981-07-??	Calcium accumulation in erythrocytes leads to a disco-spheroechinocyte shape transformation with a loss of cellular deformability resulting in a decreased lifespan in the peripheral circulation. This review discusses the role of calcium in the morphologic alteration of erythrocytes which appears to involve modifications of the inner membrane cytoskeletal proteins that regulate cell shape and membrane deformability. It is hypothesized that calcium interacts with the cytoskeletal proteins to alter their physical state or spatial arrangement such that there is a contractile response of the internal lipid bilayer which causes the echinocytic shape.
15479034	Sensory and analytical study of rose sparkling wines manufactured by second fermentation in the bottle.	aging	2004-10-20	The sensory and analytical characteristics of five rose sparkling wines manufactured by the traditional method have been determined. Moreover, the changes that take place in the nitrogen and volatile fraction of the wines during the second fermentation and the aging with the yeasts have been studied. Each of these wines was made from a single industrial rose base wine of the Garnacha Tinta variety, with five selected yeasts strains. The base wine had a low content in free amino acids, 16 mg/L, and the yeast consumed more peptides than free amino acids during second fermentation. From the application of the two-way analysis of variance, yeast strain, and aging time factors to the data of volatile compounds, it has been found that most of the differences between these sparkling wines are due to the aging time. It has been verified that these rose sparkling wines have foam of good quality and that the grape variety Garnacha Tinta is suitable for the production of rose sparkling wines.
9637785	The regulation of cyclin D1 expression in senescent human fibroblasts.	aging	1998-06-15	To clarify the molecular mechanisms of cyclin D1 expression during in vitro cellular aging, we investigated the binding of nuclear protein factors to the cyclin D1 gene promoter domain in young and senescent normal human fibroblasts. The cyclin D1 promoter binding activities of nuclear protein factors from young and senescent cells were examined by the gel mobility shift assay. Our findings revealed that (i) the binding of a specific nuclear factor to the enhancer element was very weak in senescent cells; (ii) the binding of a specific nuclear factor to the CRE, which is independent of cell growth, was unchanged between young and senescent cells; (iii) nuclear factors from senescent cells did not bind to the presumptive silencer element; (iv) the binding of specific factors to the Inr (transcription initiation region) and E2F increased with growth stimulation in young cells and was weakly detectable in senescent cells; and (v) the binding of Sp1 to its promoter element occurred only in…
23816621	Lysosome-mediated processing of chromatin in senescence.	aging	2013-07-08	Cellular senescence is a stable proliferation arrest, a potent tumor suppressor mechanism, and a likely contributor to tissue aging. Cellular senescence involves extensive cellular remodeling, including of chromatin structure. Autophagy and lysosomes are important for recycling of cellular constituents and cell remodeling. Here we show that an autophagy/lysosomal pathway processes chromatin in senescent cells. In senescent cells, lamin A/C-negative, but strongly γ-H2AX-positive and H3K27me3-positive, cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs) budded off nuclei, and this was associated with lamin B1 down-regulation and the loss of nuclear envelope integrity. In the cytoplasm, CCFs were targeted by the autophagy machinery. Senescent cells exhibited markers of lysosomal-mediated proteolytic processing of histones and were progressively depleted of total histone content in a lysosome-dependent manner. In vivo, depletion of histones correlated with nevus maturation, an established histopatholog…
20536836	HSPB1, actin filament dynamics, and aging cells.	aging	2010-06-??	Investigations into the possible roles of human HSPB1 in aging have focused on its role as a molecular chaperone protecting partially folded or unfolded proteins, particularly during oxidative stress. A thorough analysis of potential roles of HSPB1 in aging cells has been hampered by a limited knowledge of its functions in living cells. Most studies have employed cell-free extracts and purified proteins. For example, HSPB1 is known to bind actin in vitro, and this observation led to the hypothesis that HSPB1 regulates actin filament dynamics. In the study summarized herein, the role of HSPB1 in regulating actin filament dynamics was further investigated by using cultured human cells. These results show that HSPB1 and actin form a complex in vivo and that HSPB1 is important for cell motility. A model for HSPB1 as a regulator of actin filament dynamics is presented, and evidence from the literature on cytoskeletal alterations in aging cells is discussed.
7737191	Increased membrane-protein methylation in hereditary spherocytosis. A marker of cytoskeletal disarray.	aging	1995-03-15	Protein carboxyl methyltransferase of type II selectively recognizes L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues spontaneously occurring in proteins and peptide substrates. Membrane protein methylation levels increase with erythrocyte aging in circulation, in parallel with the spontaneous formation of abnormal aspartyl sites, due to protein intrinsic instability. We found that enzymic methyl esterification of erythrocyte membrane proteins in hereditary spherocytosis, a model of cytoskeletal disarray, is significantly increased compared to normal red blood cells. This cannot be explained by an increase in mean age of spherocytes, which are on the contrary significantly younger than control cells. No differences in cytosolic methyltransferase specific activity, as well as in the intracellular concentrations of the methyl donor adenosylmethionine and/or of the methylation inhibitor adenosylhomocysteine were observed. We identified bands 2.1, 4.1 and 4.2 as the main targets for increased methyla…
20216556	Transcobalamin C776G genotype modifies the association between vitamin B12 and homocysteine in older Hispanics.	aging	2010-05-??	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A common polymorphism, C776G, in the plasma B12 transport protein transcobalamin (TC), encodes for either proline or arginine at codon 259. This polymorphism may affect the affinity of TC for B12 and subsequent delivery of B12 to tissues.    SUBJECTS/METHODS: TC genotype and its associations with indicators of B12 status, including total B12, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, were evaluated in a cohort of elderly Latinos (N=554, age 60-93 years) from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA).    RESULTS: The distribution of TC genotypes was 41.3% homozygous reference (776CC) and 11.6% homozygous variant (776GG). No differences between the homozygous genotypes were observed in total B12, holoTC, methylmalonic acid or homocysteine. The holoTC/total B12 ratio was lower in the 776GG group compared with the 776CC group (P=0.04). Significant interactions of TC genotype with total B12 (P=0.04) and with holoTC (P< or =0.03) were ob…
28825967	Dietary acid load and renal function have varying effects on blood acid-base status and exercise performance across age and sex.	aging	2017-12-??	Diet composition influences acid-base status of the body. This may become more relevant as renal functional capacity declines with aging. We examined the effects of low (LD) versus high dietary acid load (HD) on blood acid-base status and exercise performance. Participants included 22 adolescents, 33 young adults (YA), and 33 elderly (EL), who followed a 7-day LD and HD in a randomized order. At the end of both diet periods the subjects performed a cycle ergometer test (3 × 10 min at 35%, 55%, 75%, and (except EL) until exhaustion at 100% of maximal oxygen uptake). At the beginning of and after the diet periods, blood samples were collected at rest and after all workloads. Oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and heart rate (HR) were monitored during cycling. In YA and EL, bicarbonate (HCO) and base excess (BE) decreased over the HD period, and HCO, BE, and pH were lower at rest after HD compared with LD. In YA and EL women, HCO and BE were lower at submaximal workloads aft…
2056779	Evidence for membrane protein oxidation during in vivo aging of human erythrocytes.	aging	1991-03-??	Oxidative lesions to membrane proteins were studied in human erythrocytes of different age and were evaluated on ghost membrane preparations by assaying thiol and methionine sulphoxide groups, and in situ on intact cells, after treating erythrocytes with the fluorochrome N-(7-dimethyl-amino-4-methyl-coumarinyl) maleimide (DACM). DACM reacts with thiol groups and the amount of this reagent bound by membrane proteins was quantified after SDS-PAGE separation. Results obtained show that during aging of normal cells the oxidative state of membrane proteins increases: this was better shown by the assay of methionine sulphoxide residues rather than by the thiol titration, when studies were carried out on ghost membranes. After separation of individual membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE, decreased accessibility of DACM to thiol groups of band 3 and of the main proteins of the membrane skeleton was evident in senescent erythrocytes. These results show that during aging, band 3 and membrane skeleton …
2632284	Polyamine metabolism and cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts during senescence in culture.	aging	1989-??-??	Aging of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts in culture is accompanied by specific changes of polyamine metabolism including: (a) a fivefold decrease of serum-induced activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1 EC 4.1.1.17); (b) a six to tenfold increase of polyamine catabolism; and (c) a reduction of putrescine uptake. These changes apparently led to a significant reduction of putrescine accumulation in senescent cells following serum stimulation. Since the induction of ODC is a mid-G1 event, the change of polyamine metabolism may be related to changes of expression of other cell-cycle-dependent genes during cellular aging. In addition to ODC gene, we have examined the expression of two early G1 genes, c-erbB and c-myc, and one late G1/S gene thymidine kinase, at mRNA levels, in both young and old IMR-90 cells. We have also compared the enzyme activities of two late G1/S genes, thymidine kinase and thymidylate synthetase, in young and old cells following serum stimulation. We did not obser…
7213901	The effect of changing extracellular osmolality on water transport in the human red blood cell as measured by the cell water residence time and the activation energy of water transport.	aging	1981-01-22	A pulse NMR technique employing low extracellular Mn2+ concentrations has been used in following the effect of variations in extracellular osmolality on water transport through the human red blood cell membrane. We report results including the effect of osmolality on the cell water lifetime (tau a) and, for the first time, the effect on the proton spin-spin relaxation of the intracellular water (T2a) and the activation energy for the water transport process. Current results are encouraging in correlating the effects seen in this study with suspected membrane functional changes occurring in both in vivo and in vitro aging and during in vitro preservation attempts.
18304769	Zinc supplementation boosts the stress response in the elderly: Hsp70 status is linked to zinc availability in peripheral lymphocytes.	aging	2008-05-??	Chaperones and zinc are indispensable for proper immune function. All the zinc status, the immune function and the stress response decline during aging. Here we studied the effect of nutritional zinc and zinc homeostasis on the stress response in healthy old subjects recruited during the ZincAge European Union project that either underwent or not a 48-day zinc supplementation. Inducible Hsp70 levels were determined at basal conditions as well as after heat shock in the CD3+ and CD3- subset of lymphocytes by a two-color FACS analysis. Short term zinc supplementation resulted in a marked increase in both basal as well as stress-induced Hsp70 levels in lymphocytes from healthy elderly donors with a higher impact on CD3+ cells. Heat inducibility showed a strong correlation with basal Hsp70 level, and both basal as well as stress-induced Hsp70 highly correlated with intracellular zinc availability. In conclusion, short term oral supplementation with zinc safely and efficiently induces the s…
15050286	Effects of a reduced oxygen tension culture system on human T cell clones as a function of in vitro age.	lifespan	2004-04-??	Oxidative DNA damage has been suggested to contribute to the decline in T cell clone (TCC) function with increased age in vitro. To test this hypothesis the effect of a reduced oxygen tension culture system (6% O(2)) on TCCs was examined. Specifically, the effects of the altered culture conditions on DNA damage levels, in vitro lifespan and proliferative capacity were assessed in five independently derived human CD4+ TCCs. DNA damage levels over the entire lifespan were significantly lowered by reducing oxygen tension. Lifespan (total population doublings (PDs) achieved) and proliferative capacity (PDs/week) were reduced for all clones under reduced oxygen tension when compared to standard culture conditions. This observed tendency warrants further investigation using a greater number of clones from donors of all age groups before definitive conclusions regarding the effect of low oxygen tension on the lifespan and proliferative capacity of TCC can be made. However, these results may s…
24243654	Quantification of aortic stiffness using MR elastography and its comparison to MRI-based pulse wave velocity.	aging	2015-01-??	PURPOSE: To determine the correlation in abdominal aortic stiffness obtained using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) (μ(MRE)) and MRI-based pulse wave velocity (PWV) shear stiffness (μ(PWV)) estimates in normal volunteers of varying age, and also to determine the correlation between μ(MRE) and μ(PWV).    MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo aortic MRE and MRI were performed on 21 healthy volunteers with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years to obtain wave and velocity data along the long axis of the abdominal aorta. The MRE wave images were analyzed to obtain mean stiffness and the phase contrast images were analyzed to obtain PWV measurements and indirectly estimate stiffness values from the Moens-Korteweg equation.    RESULTS: Both μ(MRE) and μ(PWV) measurements increased with age, demonstrating linear correlations with R(2) values of 0.81 and 0.67, respectively. Significant difference (P ≤ 0.001) in mean μ(MRE) and μ(PWV) between young and old healthy volunteers was also observed. Furtherm…
12417187	The influence of inert packaging on the shelf ageing of gamma-irradiation sterilised ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.	aging	2003-01-??	Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is used for wear applications in total hip prostheses and total knee prostheses. Sterilisation of these prostheses is commonly by gamma-irradiation. This process creates reactive free radicals in the UHMWPE, greatly increasing its susceptibility to oxidative degradation. This study has investigated the influence of air and vacuum packaging on the properties of gamma-irradiated UHMWPE (GUR1050) following 3 years of shelf ageing. The findings indicate that vacuum packaging minimises oxidative degradation reactions that occur for UHMWPE during shelf ageing. However, gamma-irradiation of vacuum-packaged UHMWPE promotes a degree of cross-linking. It is proposed that this may enhance the wear performance of UHMWPE. Accelerated ageing studies indicate that 3 years of shelf ageing would also seem to reduce the susceptibility of gamma-irradiated UHMWPE to oxidative degradation upon removal from its vacuum packaging.
17317627	Phosphorylation of HuR by Chk2 regulates SIRT1 expression.	longevity	2007-02-23	The RNA binding protein HuR regulates the stability of many target mRNAs. Here, we report that HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. Unexpectedly, oxidative stress triggered the dissociation of the [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] complex, in turn promoting SIRT1 mRNA decay, reducing SIRT1 abundance, and lowering cell survival. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase Chk2 was activated by H(2)O(2), interacted with HuR, and was predicted to phosphorylate HuR at residues S88, S100, and T118. Mutation of these residues revealed a complex pattern of HuR binding, with S100 appearing to be important for [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] dissociation after H(2)O(2). Our findings demonstrate that HuR regulates SIRT1 expression, underscore functional links between the two stress-response proteins, and implicate Chk2 in these processes.
17616172	Deamidation alters the structure and decreases the stability of human lens betaA3-crystallin.	aging	2007-07-31	According to the World Health Organization, cataracts account for half of the blindness in the world, with the majority occurring in developing countries. A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye due to light scattering of precipitated lens proteins or aberrant cellular debris. The major proteins in the lens are crystallins, and they are extensively deamidated during aging and cataracts. Deamidation has been detected at the domain and monomer interfaces of several crystallins during aging. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of two potential deamidation sites at the predicted interface of the betaA3-crystallin dimer on its structure and stability. The glutamine residues at the reported in vivo deamidation sites of Q180 in the C-terminal domain and at the homologous site Q85 in the N-terminal domain were substituted with glutamic acid residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that there were subtle diffe…
26748253	mir-24 activity propagates stress-induced senescence by down regulating DNA topoisomerase 1.	aging	2016-03-??	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding executor RNAs. Their function as key modulators of cellular senescence has been widely recognized recently. By cross-comparing several human aging models we previously identified dozens of miRNAs being differentially regulated during aging. Here the functions of two miRNAs, mir-24 and mir-424, were investigated in an oxidative stress-induced fibroblast premature senescence model. Using pre-miRNA precursors, miRNAs were overexpressed in cells undergoing premature senescence induced by oxidative stress. More senescent cells were observed in mir-24 transfected cells. p53 was upregulated in mir-24 overexpressing cells, but downregulated in mir-424 overexpressing cells. DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1), an enzyme controlling DNA topology, was identified as a target of mir-24, whose expression was induced by oxidative stress. Knocking down TOP1 induced cellular senescence. These results suggest that mir-24 activity propagates stress-induced senesc…
17086878	Postoperative host responses in elderly patients after gastrointestinal surgery.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The age-associated dysregulation of hemodynamic, metabolic and immune responses contributes to the high incidence of complications after major abdominal surgery.    METHODOLOGY: Ninety-five patients who underwent gastric resection (n=51) and colorectal resection (n=44) were divided according to age into Groups A (n=45, less than 70 years old), B (n=30, 70-79 years) and C (n=20, over 80 years). Flow cytometric analysis of CD4+ lymphocytes for interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4 production determined the Th1/2 balance. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry, and hemodynamics were studied using pulse dye densitometry.    RESULTS: Surgical procedures, operating time, blood loss and morbidity did not significantly differ among the three groups. The cardiac index (CI) in group A and B increased significantly over preoperative levels until POD 3, but there were no significant perioperative changes in the CI levels of group C. Resting energy expendit…
29716599	Proprioceptive impairments in high fall risk older adults: the effect of mechanical calf vibration on postural balance.	aging	2018-05-02	BACKGROUND: Impairments in proprioceptive mechanism with aging has been observed and associated with fall risk. The purpose of the current study was to assess proprioceptive deficits among high fall risk individuals in comparison with healthy participants, when postural performance was disturbed using low-frequency mechanical gastrocnemius vibratory stimulation.    METHODS: Three groups of participants were recruited: healthy young (n = 10; age = 23 ± 2 years), healthy elders (n = 10; age = 73 ± 3 years), and high fall risk elders (n = 10; age = 84 ± 9 years). Eyes-open and eyes-closed upright standing balance performance was measured with no vibration, and 30 and 40 Hz vibration of both calves. Vibration-induced changes in balance behaviors, compared to baseline (no vibratory stimulation) were compared between three groups using multivariable repeated measures analysis of variance models.    RESULTS: Overall, similar results were observed for two vibration frequencies. However, change…
12560492	Functional consequences of mutations in the conserved SF2 motifs and post-translational phosphorylation of the CSB protein.	aging	2003-02-01	The rare inherited human genetic disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by developmental abnormalities, UV sensitivity and premature aging. The cellular and molecular phenotypes of CS include increased sensitivity to UV-induced and oxidative DNA lesions. Two genes are involved: CSA and CSB. The CS group B (CSB) protein has roles in transcription, transcription-coupled repair, and base excision repair. It is a DNA stimulated ATPase and remodels chromatin in vitro. Here, we have analyzed wild-type (wt) and motif II, V and VI mutant CSB proteins. We find that the mutant proteins display different degrees of ATPase activity deficiency, and in contrast to the in vivo complementation studies, the motif II mutant is more defective than motif V and VI CSB mutants. Furthermore, CSB wt ATPase activity was studied with different biologically important DNA cofactors: DNA with different secondary structures and damaged DNA. The results indicate that the state of DNA secondary structure af…
15247085	Mechanisms of hormesis through mild heat stress on human cells.	aging	2004-06-??	In a series of experimental studies, it was shown that repetitive mild heat stress has antiaging hormetic effects on growth and various other cellular and biochemical characteristics of human skin fibroblasts undergoing aging in vitro. We have reported the hormetic effects of repeated challenge at the levels of maintenance of stress protein profile; reduction in the accumulation of oxidatively and glycoxidatively damaged proteins; stimulation of the proteasomal activities for the degradation of abnormal proteins; improved cellular resistance to ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and ultraviolet-B rays; and enhanced levels of various antioxidant enzymes. Detailed analysis of the signal transduction pathways to determine alterations in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation states of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases as a measure of cellular responsiveness to mild and severe heat stress is in progress. Furthermore, comparative studies using nonaging immortal cell lines, such as SV40-transformed …
26189299	Protective properties of ginsenoside Rb1 against UV-B radiation-induced oxidative stress in human dermal keratinocytes.	aging	2015-06-??	Ginsenosides, also known as ginseng saponins, are responsible for most pharmacological effect of ginseng. Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) exerts a variety of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antistress, anti-aging and anti-neurodegenerative activities. The aim of the present work was to assess the skin anti-photoaging properties of Rb1 in human dermal keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The anti-photoaging activity was evaluated by analyzing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as cell viability for HaCaT cells under UV-B irradiation. Rb1 was able to suppress the ROS levels which were elevated under UV-B irradiation, and unable to influence cellular survival in UV-B-irradiated HaCaT cells. Rb1 diminished the enhancement of MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity in conditioned medium, which corresponded with the decreased MMP-2 protein levels in both conditioned medium and cellular lysate prepared from UV-B-irradiated HaCaT cultures. Rb1 cou…
18387321	Presence of cytosolic peroxiredoxin 2 in the erythrocyte membrane of patients with hereditary spherocytosis.	aging	????-??-??	We studied 82 Portuguese individuals, 57 with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and 25 unaffected controls. We performed standardized diagnosis tests, including electrophoretic membrane protein analysis to identify and quantify protein deficiencies underlying HS. Membrane bound hemoglobin (MBH) and band 3 profiles were determined as oxidative stress and aging markers. A protein of about 22 kDa, present in 21 of 57 HS patients, but not in controls, was identified as peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), by mass-spectroscopy and by immunoblotting. Human erythrocyte Prx2 is a peroxiredoxin with thiol-specific antioxidant activity. The presence of Prx2 in erythrocyte membranes was linked to higher levels of oxidative stress, as reflected by significantly increased MBH in those HS patients. No relation with HS clinical severity was observed and Prx2 was detected in all types of membrane protein abnormalities. Prx2 membrane linkage is associated with a higher oxidative stress susceptibility of HS erythrocytes…
28629117	Alpha- and Gamma-Tocopherol and Telomere Length in 5768 US Men and Women: A NHANES Study.	aging	2017-06-13	Antioxidants have a number of potential health benefits. The present investigation was designed to determine the relationship between serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels (powerful antioxidants), and leukocyte telomere length (a biomarker of biological aging). A cross-sectional design was employed to study 5768 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). DNA was obtained via blood samples. Telomere length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Serum concentrations of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that for each one-year increase in age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter ( = 410.4,  < 0.0001). After adjusting for differences in the demographic covariates, for each µg/dL higher level of gamma-tocopherol, telomeres were 0.33 base pairs shorter ( = 7.1,  = 0.0126). Telomeres were approximately 1 year shorter (15.6 base pairs) for each increme…
11481283	Oxidative stress--induced single-strand breaks in chromosomal telomeres of human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro.	aging	2001-08-??	PURPOSE: To demonstrate that chronic hyperoxia induces single-stranded breaks in chromosomal telomeres as a measure of oxidative DNA damage in cultured RPE cells.    METHODS: RPE340 cells were cultured in 40% and 20% (control) O(2). DNA damage was assessed by mean terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length, and the S1 nuclease assay was used to determine the frequency of single-strand breaks in telomeric DNA. The degree of oxidative stress in cells was estimated by flow cytometric analysis of reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI)-induced 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence and Northern blot analysis of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA induction.    RESULTS: The mean TRF length of cells grown in 40% O(2) shortened at a faster rate than those grown in 20% O(2). The S1 nuclease assay showed that the accelerated mean TRF length shortening was due to an increased accumulation of single-stranded breaks in telomeric DNA. The degree of ROI production and HO-1 mRNA induction was gr…
9271367	Simultaneous assessment of conformation and aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.	aging	1997-08-??	Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to study conformation and aggregation of the synthetic beta-amyloid peptide, residues 1-40 (betaA4), as a function of concentration and sample aging. All mass spectra showed a major envelope of peaks corresponding to charge states of 7-3 of the monomeric form of betaA4. In addition, weaker envelopes of peaks corresponding to charge states of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric betaA4 species were seen under gentle ionization conditions. The average charge state of the envelope associated with the monomeric form decreased by ca. 0.5 z as samples were aged, indicating that the relatively open form (likely random coil) of the peptide was modified into the more compact form (likely beta-sheet) as a function of sample aging. The aggregate forms became weaker and ultimately were absent both in the more dilute solutions and in aged aliquots of the concentrated sample. These aggregates were interpreted as assemblies of the random coil form. We i…
19566987	Evaluation of hardness and colour change of soft liners after accelerated ageing.	longevity	2009-07-??	INTRODUCTION: Soft liners have been developed to offer comfort to denture wearers. However, this comfort is compromised when there is a change in the properties of the material, causing colour change, solubility, absorption and hardening. These characteristics can compromise the longevity of soft liners.    AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of ageing on both the hardness and colour change of two soft liners following accelerated ageing.    METHODS: Two denture liners, one resin based (Trusoft, Bosworth, Illinois, USA) and one silicone based (Ufi Gel P, Voco GMBH, Cuxhaven, Germany), were tested in this study for both hardness (using the Shore A scale) and colour change (using the CIE L*a*b* colour scale), initially and after 1008 hours (6 weeks) of accelerated ageing. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t-test with the Welch correction.    RESULTS: These indicated that both materials increased in hardness and underwent colour change aft…
11257459	EGF receptor crosstalks with cytokine receptors leading to the activation of c-Jun kinase in response to UV irradiation in human keratinocytes.	aging	2001-02-??	Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes photoageing through induction of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMP), which are upregulated by activator protein-1 (AP-1) (Jun/Fos). The c-Jun kinase activity proves to be critically important in the regulation of AP-1 activity. Our previous studies showed that UV irradiation activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytokine receptors leading to the activation of c-Jun kinase in cultured human skin keratinocytes in vitro and in human skin in vivo. However, the mechanism of UV-induced cell surface receptor activation and the crosstalk among growth factor receptor and cytokine receptors were not fully investigated. This study showed that UV (30 mJ/cm(2))-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in a manner similar to EGF (100 ng/ml), or IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) in cultured human keratinocytes. In all cases, EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was completely inhibited by pretreatment of PD153035 (100 nM, 1 h). Also observed was that UV induced auto…
3922590	Intestinal lactase activity and calcium absorption in the aging female with osteoporosis.	aging	1985-01-??	In 11 postmenopausal women with histologically proven osteoporosis and normal lactose tolerance, a direct correlation between calcium absorption and intestinal lactase activity was observed. The results suggest that varying degrees of relative deficiencies in intestinal lactase might contribute to the graded decrease in calcium absorption which characterizes the aging female population.
1590296	Data and patterns of transverse dentofacial structure of 6- to 15-year-old children: a posteroanterior cephalometric study.	aging	1992-05-??	The aims of the present cross-sectional investigation were to provide normative data of selected dentofacial posteroanterior cephalometric measures and to describe the patterns of transverse dentofacial structure. The material comprised the P-A cephalograms of 588 Austrian schoolchildren (157 girls and 431 boys, who were 6 to 15 years old). All subjects were healthy, presented various types of occlusions, and did not receive orthodontic or orthopedic therapy. In studying the P-A cephalograms, 8 linear and 2 angular variables, as well as 10 ratios were used. The results of the study revealed that all skeletal widths and all ratios representing relations between the various breadths of the facial skeleton and the interorbital width demonstrated an increase when the measurements at the initial and final ages of 6 and 15 years, respectively, were compared. However, the maxillary intermolar width during the period from 9 to 12 years did not present any increase, and the mandibular intermola…
19135972	Age-related differences in oxidative protein-damage in young and senescent fibroblasts.	aging	2009-03-01	Aging is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidized proteins and cross-linked modified protein material. The intracellular formation and accumulation of highly oxidized and cross-linked proteins, the so-called lipofuscin, is a typical sign of senescence. However, little is known whether the lipofuscin accumulation during aging is related to environmental conditions, as oxidative stress, and whether the accumulation of oxidized proteins and lipofuscin is preferentially taking place in the cytosol or the nucleus and finally, what is the role of lysosomes in this process. Therefore, we investigated human skin fibroblasts in an early stage of proliferation ("young cells") and in a late stage ("senescent cells"). Such cells were compared for the amount of protein carbonyls and lipofuscin and their distribution within the cytosol and the nucleus. Furthermore, cells were exposed to single and repeated doses of hydrogen peroxide and paraquat, measuring the same set of parameters. In addition t…
16601529	Factors influencing food intake in patients with heart failure: a comparison with healthy elders.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Promoting adequate nutritional intake of patients with heart failure (HF) is an essential component of comprehensive management. This goal can be hampered by decreased appetite, as well as psychological, social, and HF-related factors that can affect food intake. Factors related to aging may also affect food intake in older patients. The purpose of this study was to compare patients with HF to healthy elders regarding the extent to which they perceived how appetite and hunger, emotional and social, and illness factors affected the amount of food they ate in the previous week.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with HF were recruited from 3 Midwestern HF clinics. As part of a larger study examining nutrition in HF, patients filled out the Food Eating Experiences and Diet (FEED) questionnaire, an instrument designed to assess factors affecting appetite and hunger. Patients were asked to rate their hunger and appetite on a visual analog scale.…
28856553	Improving Naming Abilities Among Healthy Young-Old Adults Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.	aging	2018-02-??	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive tool to facilitate brain plasticity and enhance language abilities. Our study aims to search for a potential beneficial influence of tDCS on a cognitive linguistic task of naming which found to decline during aging. A group of fifteen healthy old adults [Formula: see text] were tested in naming 50 pictures of objects. Each subject participated in two sessions spanning on a one week period. One session included active tDCS stimulation and the other sham-placebo like stimulation. Subjects were blinded to stimulation type. During the active stimulation a bilateral protocol of anodal tDCS to the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) combined with cathodal tDCS to the right IFG was delivered. Half of participants received active stimulation at the first session and sham at the second and half received the stimulations at the opposite order. Naming reaction time was measured at baseline, after active tDCS stimulation and after sham.…
23110488	Advancing the field of elder abuse: future directions and policy implications.	aging	2012-11-??	Elder abuse, sometimes called elder mistreatment or elder maltreatment, includes psychological, physical, and sexual abuse; neglect (caregiver neglect and self-neglect); and financial exploitation. Evidence suggests that one in 10 older adults experiences some form of elder abuse, but only one in 25 cases is reported to social services agencies. At the same time, elder abuse is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Despite these findings, there is a great paucity in research, practice, and policy addressing the pervasive issues of elder abuse. Through my experiences as a American Political Sciences Association Congressional Policy Fellow and Health and Aging Policy Fellow working with the Administration on Community Living (ACL) (previously known as the Administration on Aging) for the last 2 years, I will describe the major functions of the ACL and highlight two major pieces of federal legislation: The Older Americans Act and the Elder Justice Act. I will also…
15127395	Quantifying the effect of resin type and sterilization method on the degradation of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene after 4 years of real-time shelf aging.	aging	2004-06-01	Alternative sterilization methods including ethylene oxide, gas plasma, and gamma-radiation in an inert environment were implemented in the late 1990s, to limit oxidative degradation of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (PE). There was also a simultaneous transition to PE resins that did not contain calcium stearate. Shelf storage duration of PE inserts following gamma-irradiation in air has been correlated to poor clinical performance and increased wear. This study aimed to determine how sterilization method and resin type influenced degradation of PE after 4 years of real-time shelf aging. It was hypothesized that gamma-irradiation and stearate containing resins would incur significantly more degradation than nonradiated, stearate-free resins. Gamma-irradiated PE samples in air and nitrogen had a significantly increased density and oxidation index, compared to nonirradiated PE after 4 years of shelf aging. Alternative sterilization methods such as ethylene oxide and gas plasma …
29214828	Dose-Response Association Between Physical Activity and Cognitive Function in a National Sample of Older Adults.	aging	2018-??-??	PURPOSE: Previous research demonstrates a favorable effect of physical activity on cognitive function among older adults. The potential dose-response relationship between physical activity and cognitive function in this population is less understood, which was the purpose of this study.    SETTING: Data from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were employed.    PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2157 older adults aged 60 to 85 years.    MEASURES: Cognitive function was assessed from the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-min-month (MET-min-month = days × duration × MET level), was assessed via self-report, with 5 MVPA categories evaluated: (1) <2000 MVPA MET-min-month, (2) 2000 to 3999 MVPA MET-min-month, (3) 4000 to 5999 MVPA MET-min-month, (4) 6000 to 7999 MVPA MET-min-month, and (5) 8000+ MVPA MET-min-month.    ANALYSIS: Weighted multivariable linear regression.    RESULTS…
15483806	Knee-simulator testing of conventional and cross-linked polyethylene tibial inserts.	aging	2004-10-??	We compared the resistance to delamination and to adhesive/abrasive wear of conventional and highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial inserts of a cruciate-retaining total knee design using a knee simulator. Both groups were tested after aggressive, accelerated aging, and 1 set of conventional inserts was studied without aging. Aging oxidized the conventional, but not the highly cross-linked, inserts. The simulated normal gait testing lasted for 5 and 10 million cycles for the conventional and highly cross-linked inserts, respectively. Aged conventional inserts showed delaminations, whereas none were observed in the unaged conventional and aged cross-linked inserts. Wear rates measured by the gravimetric method were 9 +/- 2 mm3, 10 +/- 4 mm3, and 1 +/- 0 mm3 per million cycles; by the metrologic method, they were 8 +/- 1 mm3, 9 +/- 2 mm3, and 3 +/- 0 mm3 for the unaged conventional, aged conventional, and aged highly crosslinked inserts, respectively. In the test model used, oxidation l…
22690665	The finger of an angel: memory return with epigenetic manipulation.	aging	2012-06-??	Scientists have been trying to crack the memory code for hundreds of years; however, centuries later, even the simplest elements of memory formation are still not fully understood. Recent studies in epigenetics indicate neuronal activity can induce transient reprogramming of epigenetic codes required for long-term memory consolidation. This suggests epigenetics as a basic mechanism in the regulation of long-term memory; and highlights the possibility that epigenetic modifications, as well as environmental factors, can change certain gene expression of brain neurons to restore the ability to remember, even with an aging brain or innate mental deficits. This article is an overview of basic knowledge and current research on epigenetic regulation of long-term memory, and prospects for future research.
18026912	Human embryonic stem cells: mechanisms to escape replicative senescence?	aging	2007-12-??	Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are unique in that they can proliferate indefinitely in culture in an undifferentiated state as well as differentiate into any somatic cells. Undifferentiated hESCs do not appear to undergo senescence and remain nontransformed over multiple passages. Culture hESCs maintain telomere length and exhibit high telomerase activity after prolonged in vitro culture. The ability of hESCs to bypass senescence is lost as hESCs differentiate into fully differentiated somatic cells. This loss of immortality upon differentiation may be due to a variety aging related factors such as reduction in telomere length, alteration of telomerase activity, changes in cell cycle regulation and decrease in DNA repair ability. Absence of such aging factors as well as the lack of genomic, mitochondrial and epigenetic changes, may contribute to the lack of senescence in hESCs. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in determining changes in these aspects in prolonged hE…
23567991	Elder abuse as a risk factor for hospitalization in older persons.	aging	2013-05-27	IMPORTANCE: Elder abuse is associated with increased mortality risk. However, the relationship between elder abuse and health care services utilization remains unclear.    OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between overall elder abuse and specific subtypes of elder abuse and rate of hospitalization in a community-dwelling population of older adults.    DESIGN: Prospective population-based study.    SETTING: Chicago Health and Aging Project.    PARTICIPANTS: Of the 6674 community-dwelling older adults who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, 106 were identified by social services agencies for elder abuse.    MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary predictor was elder abuse (reported and confirmed) reported to social services agency. The outcome of interest was the annual rate of hospitalization obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Poisson regression models were used to assess these longitudinal relationships.    RESULTS: The unadjusted mean …
30200270	Identification of Oxidative Stress in Red Blood Cells with Nanoscale Chemical Resolution by Infrared Nanospectroscopy.	lifespan	2018-08-30	During their lifespan, Red blood cells (RBC), due to their inability to self-replicate, undergo an ageing degradation phenomenon. This pathway, both in vitro and in vivo, consists of a series of chemical and morphological modifications, which include deviation from the biconcave cellular shape, oxidative stress, membrane peroxidation, lipid content decrease and uncoupling of the membrane-skeleton from the lipid bilayer. Here, we use the capabilities of atomic force microscopy based infrared nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR) to study and correlate, with nanoscale resolution, the morphological and chemical modifications that occur during the natural degradation of RBCs at the subcellular level. By using the tip of an AFM to detect the photothermal expansion of RBCs, it is possible to obtain nearly two orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution IR spectra, and absorbance images than can be obtained on diffraction-limited commercial Fourier-transform Infrared (FT-IR) microscopes. Using this app…
25104461	HuR and post-transcriptional regulation in vascular aging.	aging	2014-08-??	HuR (ELAV11 (embryonic lethal, abnormal vision)-like 1), a ubiquitously expressed member of the ELAV-like RNA-binding protein family, has been shown to regulate the stability and translation of mRNAs that encode factors regulating cellular senescence, thereby impacting on aging. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of HuR's role in vascular cell senescence and vascular aging.
18177228	Development of a wearable surveillance system using gait analysis.	aging	2007-12-??	An aging society is a reality in developed countries. An aging population requires more healthcare workers and facilities. To reduce this social problem, it is worthwhile to develop a wearable computer for elders or patients to watch over them. In this study, we developed a wearable computer, in which accelerometers were installed to detect variations of posture, falls, and gait disability. The advantages of this system include a designated database server in each patient's home, scalability and flexibility to adapt to patient's needs, and full patient access to their own information. As a first step, we adopted this system for healthy young volunteers with or without impediments to validate the system. The results show that this system can successfully detect variations in posture and falls. We also succeeded in real-time automatic gait analysis by using the Hampering Index. The present study gives useful knowledge for the development of a wearable computer to support the care of elde…
9482112	Solar ultraviolet light activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases and the ternary complex factor in human normal keratinocytes.	aging	1998-02-05	Exposure to ultraviolet radiation of solar light is responsible for inflammation, premature skin aging and is the main cause of human skin carcinogenesis. While the noxious consequences of U.V. exposure are known, the molecular events triggered by this radiation are poorly understood. We observed that U.V.-A and U.V.-B irradiation of human keratinocytes induces the activation of tyrosine kinase pathways leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. We also observed a stimulation of the Stress Activated Protein kinases (SAPKs), p38 and JNK, and an activation of the transcription factors AP-1 in response to U.V.-A and U.V.-B radiation. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrated that physiological U.V. doses are able to activate the Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, which could explain the activation of the Ternary Complex Factor. Thus, in human keratinocytes, solar U.V. light activates multiple signalling pathways that could be involved in skin infl…
21520703	Endogenous antioxidants and radical scavengers.	aging	2010-??-??	All living organisms are constantly exposed to oxidant agents deriving from both endogenous and exogenous sources capable to modify biomolecules and induce damages. Free radicals generated by oxidative stress exert an important role in the development of tissue damage and aging. Reactive species (RS) derived from oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) pertain to free radicals family and are constituted by various forms of activated oxygen or nitrogen. RS are continuosly produced during normal physiological events but can be removed by antioxidant defence mechanism: the imbalance between RS and antioxidant defence mechanism leads to modifications in cellular membrane or intracellular molecules. In this chapter only endogenous antioxidant molecules will be critically discussed, such as Glutathione, Alpha-lipoic acid, Coenzyme Q, Ferritin, Uric acid, Bilirubin, Metallothioneine, L-carnitine and Melatonin.
11598021	Werner syndrome protein interacts with human flap endonuclease 1 and stimulates its cleavage activity.	aging	2001-10-15	Werner syndrome (WS) is a human premature aging disorder characterized by chromosomal instability. The cellular defects of WS presumably reflect compromised or aberrant function of a DNA metabolic pathway that under normal circumstances confers stability to the genome. We report a novel interaction of the WRN gene product with the human 5' flap endonuclease/5'-3' exonuclease (FEN-1), a DNA structure-specific nuclease implicated in DNA replication, recombination and repair. WS protein (WRN) dramatically stimulates the rate of FEN-1 cleavage of a 5' flap DNA substrate. The WRN-FEN-1 functional interaction is independent of WRN catalytic function and mediated by a 144 amino acid domain of WRN that shares homology with RecQ DNA helicases. A physical interaction between WRN and FEN-1 is demonstrated by their co-immunoprecipitation from HeLa cell lysate and affinity pull-down experiments using a recombinant C-terminal fragment of WRN. The underlying defect of WS is discussed in light of the …
22997287	Lipid component contributions to the surface activity of meibomian lipids.	aging	2012-10-17	PURPOSE: Meibomian lipid films have very complex physical properties that enable them to be compressed and expanded without collapsing. These properties can be attributed to the self assembly of the individual components, mainly wax and cholesteryl esters (WE and CE). Here, the surface pressure properties of WEs and CEs films have been compared to evaluate their contributions to meibomian lipid films.    METHODS: Films of different WEs and CEs were spread on a Langmuir trough and their surface pressure area profiles were compared with a particular emphasis on the effects caused by the degree of saturation of the alkyl/alkene chains.    RESULTS: Fully saturated WEs and CEs formed unstable films that collapsed upon compression. Very unsaturated waxes and CEs tended to have two distinct phases, one that reflects interaction with the aqueous subphase, while the second appeared to be with the multilayered bulk of the lipid film. With aging of the films, the WEs tended to move off the surfac…
20526772	Increased cation conductance in human erythrocytes artificially aged by glycation.	aging	2010-06-??	Excessive glucose concentrations foster glycation and thus premature aging of erythrocytes. The present study explored whether glycation-induced erythrocyte aging is paralleled by features of suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell membrane scrambling with subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface and cell shrinkage. Both are triggered by increases of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), which may result from activation of Ca(2+) permeable cation channels. Glycation was accomplished by exposure to high glucose concentrations (40 and 100 mM), phosphatidylserine exposure estimated from annexin binding, cell shrinkage from decrease of forward scatter, and [Ca(2+)](i) from Fluo3-fluorescence in analysis via fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cation channel activity was determined by means of whole-cell patch clamp. Glycation of total membrane proteins, immunoprecipitated TRPC3/6/7, and immunoprecipitated L-type Ca(2+) channel prote…
19471118	At concentrations that inhibit mTOR, resveratrol suppresses cellular senescence.	aging	2009-06-15	Here we demonstrated that, at cytostatic, near-toxic concentrations, resveratrol inhibited S6 phosphorylation and prevented the senescence morphology in human cells. Using a sensitive functional assay, we found that resveratrol partially prevented loss of the proliferative potential associated with cellular senescence. Resveratrol was less effective than rapamycin, because aging-suppression by resveratrol was limited by its toxicity at high concentrations. We discuss whether concentrations of resveratrol that inhibit mTOR (target of rapamycin) and suppress cellular senescence are clinically achievable and whether partial inhibition of mTOR by resveratrol might be sufficient to affect organismal aging.
6392816	Research design and analysis of data procedures for predicting body density.	aging	1984-12-??	Statistical methods used to develop body composition prediction equations were examined. Equations published in the 1960s and early 1970s have been called "population-specific" equations because they were developed on homogeneous samples. A major limitation of population-specific equations was a low ratio of subjects per variable, which reduces validity. The more recent method has been to develop "generalized" equations with large samples varying greatly in age and body fatness. The statistical models used for generalized equations were nonlinear regression analysis to account for the quadratic relation between body density and skinfold fat. Age was used as an independent variable to adjust for aging. Generalized equations exhibit accuracy consistent with population-specific equations and increase the generalizability of prediction. Future body composition research should focus on the cross-validation of published equations to define the limits of equation accuracy.
28177713	Effects of exogenous vitamins A, C, and E and NADH supplementation on proliferation, cytokines release, and cell redox status of lymphocytes from healthy aged subjects.	aging	2017-06-??	Aging is an inevitable biological event that is associated with immune alterations. These alterations are related to increased cellular oxidative stress and micronutrient deficiency. Antioxidant supplementation could improve these age-related abnormalities. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro effects of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) on T cell proliferation, cytokine release, and cell redox status in the elderly compared with young adults. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated using a density gradient of Histopaque. They were cultured in vitro and stimulated with concanavalin A in the presence or absence of vitamins. Cell proliferation was determined by conducting MTT assays, and based on interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 secretions. Cell oxidant/antioxidant balance was assessed by assaying reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde, carbonyl protein levels, and catalase activity. The present study demonstrated that T-lympho…
18651263	Pictorial superiority effects in oldest-old people.	aging	2008-10-??	We examined memory for pictures and words in middle-age (45-59 years), young-old (60-74 years), old-old (75-89 years), and the oldest-old adults (90-97 years) in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study. Stimulus items were presented and retention was tested in a blocked order where half of the participants studied 16 simple line drawings and the other half studied matching words during acquisition. Free recall and recognition followed. In the next acquisition/test block a new set of items was used where the stimulus format was changed relative to the first block. Results yielded pictorial superiority effects in both retention measures for all age groups. Follow-up analyses of clustering in free recall revealed that a greater number of categories were accessed (which reflects participants' retrieval plan) and more items were recalled per category (which reflects participants' encoding strategy) when pictures served as stimuli compared to words. Cognitive status and working memory span were co…
20211115	Modeling the time-dependent water wave stability of human hair.	aging	????-??-??	The viscoelastic bending recovery of human hair is described by a hydro-rheologically complex, two-phase model, where the humidity dependence of the pertinent parameters as well as the effects of physical aging are known. Model calculations are conducted to assess the consequences of the time- and humidity-dependent bending recovery of human hair for the formation and the stability of the water wave. It is shown that a hair fiber that has been set in bending will achieve at 65% RH a recovery of about 50% after about ten times its storage time prior to release, if it is a non-aging material. However, aging drastically slows the recovery process so that it approaches an apparent "equilibrium," final recovery value of about 60%. The values of final recovery decrease linearly with water content, vanishing as expected at maximum water content, where the hair fiber is above its glass transition. The calculations further show that damage to the elastic modulus, attributed to the intermediate …
12236388	The 2030 problem: caring for aging baby boomers.	aging	2002-08-??	OBJECTIVE: To assess the coming challenges of caring for large numbers of frail elderly as the Baby Boom generation ages.    STUDY SETTING: A review of economic and demographic data as well as simulations of projected socioeconomic and demographic patterns in the year 2030 form the basis of a review of the challenges related to caring for seniors that need to be faced by society.    STUDY DESIGN: A series of analyses are used to consider the challenges related to caring for elders in the year 2030: (1) measures of macroeconomic burden are developed and analyzed, (2) the literatures on trends in disability, payment approaches for long-term care, healthy aging, and cultural views of aging are analyzed and synthesized, and (3) simulations of future income and assets patterns of the Baby Boom generation are developed.    PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The economic burden of aging in 2030 should be no greater than the economic burden associated with raising large numbers of baby boom children in the 1…
23252344	Perceptions and attitudes towards exercise among Chinese elders - the implications of culturally based self-management strategies for effective health-related help seeking and person-centred care.	aging	2015-04-??	BACKGROUND: Encouraging the uptake of physical activity among a culturally diverse elderly population presents a challenge for health-care providers across the world. Little is known about the health-care needs of these populations, for example the increasingly ageing group of Chinese elders in many parts of the world who are now facing later life and increasing challenges to their health.    OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore behaviours and attitudes towards exercise among older Chinese immigrants in the UK to provide insights into the health of Chinese populations in the UK and elsewhere.    DESIGN: A Grounded Theory approach using purposive and theoretical sampling with in-depth semi-structured interviews.    SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Chinese elders were recruited from Chinese communities in the North West of England. Thirty-three participants were interviewed face-to-face and audio-recorded.    RESULTS: Participants self-managed exercise based on cultural perceptions of health …
25627146	Does cyclic stress play a role in highly crosslinked polyethylene oxidation?	aging	2015-03-??	BACKGROUND: Minimizing the impact of oxidation on ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene components is important for preserving their mechanical integrity while in vivo. Among the strategies to reduce oxidation in modern first-generation highly crosslinked polyethylenes (HXLPEs), postirradiation remelting was considered to afford the greatest stability. However, recent studies have documented measurable oxidation in remelted HXLPE retrievals. Biologic prooxidants and physiologic loading have been proposed as potential mechanisms.    QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In our pilot study, we asked: (1) Does cyclic stress induced by wear or (2) by cyclic compression loading increase oxidation and crystallinity of remelted HXLPE? (3) Does oxidative aging reduce the wear resistance of remelted HXLPE?    METHODS: Remelted and annealed HXLPE prisms (n = 1 per test condition) were tested in a wear simulator for 500,000 cycles. After wear testing, some samples were subjected to accelerated aging and then wea…
3015985	Increased level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in aging human lung fibroblasts.	aging	1986-08-??	Regulation of the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in cellular aging was studied using the IMR-90 diploid human lung fibroblasts. The level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase present in cell extracts was monitored by 1) photoactivated incorporation of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP into the 47,000- and 54,000-dalton regulatory subunits of the type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases, respectively; 2) cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of histone II AS catalyzed by the catalytic subunit of the kinase; and 3) fractionation and analysis of the type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. Our results showed an approximately two- to threefold increase in the level of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a somewhat smaller increase in the type II kinase in extracts of the "old" IMR-90 cells (population doubling greater than 48) as compared to that of the "young" cells (PDL 22-27). The timing of the increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase co…
21080014	Lignin-derived oak phenolics: a theoretical examination of additional potential health benefits of red wine.	aging	2011-08-??	Lignin-derived phenolic compounds can be extracted from oak barrels during the aging of red wine, and it is hypothesized that these compounds may contribute to the health benefits of red wine by their antioxidant, radical-scavenging, or chemopreventive activities. Density functional calculations (B3LYP/6-311++G) support the radical-scavenging abilities of the oak phenolics. Sinapaldehyde, syringaldehyde, syringol, and syringylacetone all have bond dissociation energies that are lower than resveratrol and comparable to the flavonoid catechin. Molecular docking studies of the oak phenolics with known resveratrol protein targets also show that these compounds dock favorably to the protein targets. Thus, lignin-derived oak phenolics, although found in small concentrations, may contribute to the beneficial antioxidant, chemopreventive, and cardioprotective effects of red wine.
23905995	Modulation of Rack-1/PKCβII signalling by soluble AβPPα in SH-SY5Y cells.	aging	2013-09-??	The soluble amyloid β precursor protein α (sAβPPα) released after α-secretase cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) has several functions including modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity; it has been suggested that some of these effects are mediated by activation of NF-κB via induction of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We have recently described the presence of several consensus binding sites of c-Rel transcription factor in the promoter region of the GNB2L1 gene, coding for the Receptor for Activated C Kinase -1 (RACK-1). We investigated whether sAβPPα could influence the expression of RACK-1 through NF-κB involvement. Our data demonstrate that sAβPPα regulates RACK-1 gene expression through PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway, inducing c-Rel nuclear translocation and NF-κB activation. Since RACK-1 is the scaffold of protein kinase C βII (PKCβII), we turned our attention to this kinase in order to evaluate whether sAβPPα could also influence PKCβII signalling dem…
16376328	Measurement of testosterone and its sub-fractions in Canada.	aging	2006-02-??	Interest in measuring bioactive testosterone in aging males has increased considerably in the last 5 years in Canada. Emerging andropause clinics have submerged our laboratories with requests for bioavailable testosterone (BAT) testing in replacement or addition to the traditional total testosterone (TT) and direct free testosterone (FT) assays. Beginning with a brief explanation of the bioavailability concept of Pardridge, this review examines the technical characteristics of various approaches currently available to measure TT and its sub-fractions. First, limitations in the measurement of TT, SHBG, and particularly direct (analog) FT assays are extracted from the scientific literature and recent external and internal QC reports. It is concluded that the free direct T assay is useless in the clinical context of andropause. The impact of the observed limitations of TT and SHBG measurements on calculated FT and BAT or BAT obtained by precipitation with ammonium sulfate is then discusse…
7440928	Psychological characteristics of Japanese aged: a comparison of sentence completion test responses of older and younger adults.	aging	1980-11-??	The psychological characteristics of 199 older Japanese adults were compared to those of 224 Japanese university students by means of a 20-item sentence completion procedure. Older Japanese adults were found to have positive images of their family, while the younger adults were more positive with respect to their friends. Older adults displayed more positive self-perceptions with respect to their present self; the young were more negative with respect to their past self-images and more positive with respect to their future self-images. With respect to present self, women displayed more positive self-perceptions consistently; men displayed more negative self-perceptions. Both age groups tended to view the aging process as a negative one, although their attitudes toward the aged were relatively positive. Young adults indicated that happiness was obtained through personal or social achievements, a result comparable to that found in American students. Older Japanese adults found pleasure i…
23295625	Fluoride gastrointestinal absorption from Na2FPO3/CaCO3- and NaF/SiO2-based toothpastes.	aging	2013-??-??	Depending on toothpaste formulation, part of the fluoride is insoluble and would not be totally absorbable in the gastrointestinal tract, thus changing dental fluorosis risk estimation. This hypothesis was tested with formulations with either all fluoride in a soluble form (NaF/SiO2-based toothpaste, 1,100 µg F/g as labeled, 1,129.7 ± 49.4 µg F/g soluble fluoride as analyzed) or with around 20% of insoluble fluoride (Na2FPO3/CaCO3-based toothpaste, 1,450 µg F/g as labeled, 1,122.4 ± 76.4 µg F/g soluble fluoride as analyzed). Toothpastes were evaluated either fresh or after accelerated aging, which increased insoluble fluoride to 40% in the Na2FPO3/CaCO3-based toothpaste. In a blind, crossover clinical trial conducted in five legs, 20 adult volunteers ingested 49.5 µg of total fluoride/kg body weight from each formulation or purified water (control). Whole saliva and urine were collected as bioavailability indicators, and pharmacokinetics parameters calculated showed significantly (p < …
17945283	Gender differences in nighttime plasma arginine vasopressin and delayed compensatory urine output in the elderly population after desmopressin.	aging	2007-12-??	PURPOSE: Monosymptomatic polyuric nocturia is a consequence of aging. We investigated physiological differences between nonpolyuric and polyuric nocturia in the elderly population in relation to urine production regulation in young volunteers with special reference to gender.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a study in 37 elderly healthy volunteers 65 years or older and 30 young healthy volunteers 20 to 40 years old who were hospitalized for 48 hours. Before admittance and during hospitalization fluid intake was standardized. The first 24 hours were at baseline conditions. On night 2 participants were given a single oral dose of desmopressin (0.4 mg). During 48 hours urine and blood samples were taken at predetermined time points to measure urine output and plasma arginine vasopressin levels.    RESULTS: Elderly individuals with nocturnal polyuria had an inverted rhythm in urine output, which was restored after a single dose of desmopressin. There was an age related change in the…
21087144	The p53/p21(WAF/CIP) pathway mediates oxidative stress and senescence in dyskeratosis congenita cells with telomerase insufficiency.	aging	2011-03-15	Telomere attrition is a natural process that occurs due to inadequate telomere maintenance. Once at a critically short threshold, telomeres signal growth arrest, leading to senescence. Telomeres can be elongated by the enzyme telomerase, which adds de novo telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Mutations in genes for telomere binding proteins or components of telomerase give rise to the premature aging disorder dyskeratosis congenita (DC), which is characterized by extremely short telomeres and an aging phenotype. The current study demonstrates that DC cells signal a DNA damage response through p53 and its downstream mediator, p21(WAF/CIP), which is accompanied by an elevation in steady-state levels of superoxide and percent glutathione disulfide, both indicators of oxidative stress. Poor proliferation of DC cells can be partially overcome by reducing O(2) tension from 21% to 4%. Further, restoring telomerase activity or inhibiting p53 or p21(WAF/CIP) significantly mitigated grow…
22052189	A set of miRNAs participates in the cellular senescence program in human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	2012-04-??	Here we show that replicative senescence in normal human diploid IMR90 fibroblasts is accompanied by altered expression of a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) (senescence-associated miRNAs), with 14 and 10 miRNAs being either up or downregulated (>2-fold), respectively, in senescent with respect to young cells. The expression of most of these miRNAs was also deregulated upon senescence induced by DNA damage (etoposide) or mild oxidative stress (diethylmaleate). Four downregulated miRNAs were part of miRNA family-17, recently associated to human cell and tissue aging. Moreover, eight upregulated and six downregulated miRNAs mapped in specific chromosomal clusters, suggesting common transcriptional regulation. Upon adoptive overexpression, seven upregulated miRNAs induced the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci and senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (P<0.05), which was accompanied, in the case of five of them, by reduced cell proliferation. Finally, miR-210, miR-3…
12588589	An evaluation of a low-intensity intervention to introduce medical students to healthy older people.	aging	2003-03-??	This is a report of a controlled, prospective, longitudinal trial of an intervention to affect medical students' attitudes toward aging. Members of the Class of 2002 at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine were assigned a senior mentor (a community-dwelling older person) upon matriculation into medical school. Students were required to perform a structured interview with the mentor once per semester for the first 2 preclinical years and to discuss these interviews in small groups mediated by geriatrics faculty. Members of the Class of 2001 were controls. Attitudes toward aging were determined using the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD) attitude scale in August 1998 and again at the end of the second year of medical school. Initial mean ASD scores were not significantly different for the two groups. Although both classes experienced improvements in their ASD scores from Time 0 to Time 1, the improvement for the class of 2002 was significantly greater than that for the class of…
25378451	Do the definitions of elder mistreatment subtypes matter? Findings from the PINE Study.	aging	2014-11-??	BACKGROUND: Elder mistreatment (EM) is a pervasive public health issue and is associated with morbidity and premature mortality. This study aimed to examine how the prevalence of EM and its subtypes vary using different definitions among U.S. Chinese older adults.    METHODS: The Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago is a population-based epidemiological survey of 3,159 U.S. Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area that is guided by a community-based participatory research approach. Participants answered questions regarding psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, caregiver neglect, and financial exploitation. Definitional approaches for EM and its subtypes were constructed from least restrictive to most restrictive.    RESULTS: Using different definitional criteria, the prevalence of psychological abuse was 1.1%-9.8%, physical abuse was 1.1%, sexual abuse was 0.2%, caregiver neglect was 4.6%-11.1%, and financial exploitation was 8.8%-9.3%. Overall, EM varied from 13…
25441422	Acceleration of heat shock-induced collagen breakdown in human dermal fibroblasts with knockdown of NF-E2-related factor 2.	aging	2015-08-??	Heat shock increases skin temperature during sun exposure and some evidence indicates that it may be involved in skin aging. The antioxidant response mediated by the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a critically important cellular defense mechanism that serves to limit skin aging. We investigated the effects of heat shock on collagenase expression when the antioxidant defense system was downregulated by knockdown of Nrf2. GSH and collagenases were analyzed, and the expression of inducible Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 was measured. HS68 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA against Nrf2. Heat shock induced the downregulation of Nrf2 in both the cytosol and nucleus and reduced the expression of HO-1, GSH, and NQO1. In addition, heat-exposed Nrf2-knockdown cells showed significantly increased levels of collagenase protein and decreased levels of procollagen. Our data suggest that Nrf2 plays an important role in protection against heat shock-induced collagen breakd…
25337918	Greater BOLD variability in older compared with younger adults during audiovisual speech perception.	aging	2014-??-??	Older adults exhibit decreased performance and increased trial-to-trial variability on a range of cognitive tasks, including speech perception. We used blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) to search for neural correlates of these behavioral phenomena. We compared brain responses to simple speech stimuli (audiovisual syllables) in 24 healthy older adults (53 to 70 years old) and 14 younger adults (23 to 39 years old) using two independent analysis strategies: region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-wise whole-brain analysis. While mean response amplitudes were moderately greater in younger adults, older adults had much greater within-subject variability. The greatly increased variability in older adults was observed for both individual voxels in the whole-brain analysis and for ROIs in the left superior temporal sulcus, the left auditory cortex, and the left visual cortex. Increased variability in older adults could not be attributed to differences i…
26733672	From cradle to grave: tracking socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in a cohort of 11 868 men and women born in Uppsala, Sweden, 1915-1929.	lifespan	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Ample evidence has shown that early-life social conditions are associated with mortality later in life. However, little attention has been given to the strength of these effects across specific age intervals from birth to old age. In this paper, we study the effect of the family's socioeconomic position and mother's marital status at birth on all-cause mortality at different age intervals in a Swedish cohort of 11 868 individuals followed across their lifespan.    METHODS: Using the Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, we fitted Cox regression models to estimate age-varying HRs of all-cause mortality according to mother's marital status and family's socioeconomic position.    RESULTS: Mother's marital status and family's socioeconomic position at birth were associated with higher mortality rates throughout life (HR 1.18 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.26) for unmarried mothers; 1.19 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.25) for low socioeconomic position). While the effect of family's socioeconomic…
22529335	ATM-dependent phosphorylation of SNEVhPrp19/hPso4 is involved in extending cellular life span and suppression of apoptosis.	aging	2012-04-??	Defective DNA repair is widely acknowledged to negatively impact on healthy aging, since mutations in DNA repair factors lead to accelerated and premature aging. However, the opposite, namely if improved DNA repair will also increase the life or health span is less clear, and only few studies have tested if overexpression of DNA repair factors modulates life and health span in cells or organisms. Recently, we identified and characterized SNEVhPrp19/hPso4, a protein that plays a role in DNA repair and pre-mRNA splicing, and observed a doubling of the replicative life span upon ectopic overexpression, accompanied by lower basal DNA damage and apoptosis levels as well as an increased resistance to oxidative stress. Here we find that SNEVhPrp19/hPso4 is phosphorylated at S149 in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM)-dependent manner in response to oxidative stress and DNA double strand break inducing agents. By overexpressing wild-type SNEVhPrp19/hPso4 and a phosphorylation-defici…
12470833	Age-related increase of protein glycation in peripheral blood lymphocytes is restricted to preferential target proteins.	aging	????-??-??	Advanced glycation end products (AGE) have been analyzed in aging human peripheral blood lymphocytes since protein glycation and glycoxidation are believed to contribute to the intracellular age-related accumulation of damaged proteins, a process that has been associated with the cellular functional deficits that occur with age. The appearance of AGE in cell lysates was monitored with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-AGE antibody raised against glycated RNAse. When lymphocyte cytosolic extracts from old donors (86-91 years old) were compared with those from young donors (20-25 years old), a small but significant 40% increase of protein glycation was observed. In both age groups, further analysis of the pattern of glycated proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by western blotting with the same anti-AGE antibody, showed that the protein silver stain and the immunoblot patterns were not superimposable indicating that glycoxidative modifications are tar…
28595429	Expanding palliative care's reach in the community via the elder service agency network.	aging	2017-08-??	Over the past two decades, palliative care has established itself as a promising approach to address the complex needs of individuals with advanced illness. Palliative care is well-established in US hospitals and has recently begun to expand outside of the hospital setting to meet the needs of non-hospitalized individuals. Experts have called for the development of innovative community-based models that facilitate delivery of palliative care to this target population. Elder service agencies are important partners that researchers should collaborate with to develop new and promising models. Millions of older adults receive aging network services in the U.S., highlighting the potential reach of these models. Recent health care reform efforts provide support for community-based initiatives, where coordination of care and services, delivered via health and social service agencies, is highly prioritized. This article describes the rationale for developing such approaches, including efforts …
865143	Macromolecular synthesis in human fibroblasts at 37 degrees and 42 degrees C during aging in vitro.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	A normal strain of human skin fibroblasts was pulse labelled at 42 degrees and 37 degrees C during intervals of the in vitro lifespan with 3H-thymidine, 3H-uridine and 14C-phenylalanine, precursors of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, respectively. No increased heat lability could be detected in the relative profiles of precursor incorporation at the two temperatures until terminal stages of passage when a minor increase in heat lability appeared in RNA and protein synthesis. Early passage cells, grown in the presence of the substrate analogues, p-fluorophenylalanine or 5-fluorouracil, showed a moderate increase in relative heat lability but comparable patterns were not evident in drug-free cultures, even at terminal stages of passage. Although the results indicate that defects exist in enzyme pathways for macromolecular synthesis at terminal stages of growth and in the presence of analogues, they do not support the hypothesis that such defects are causal to the onset of cellular aging i…
17855140	Is there a relationship between spontaneous GH secretion, anthropometric parameters and exercise capacity in healthy men over 50 years?	aging	2008-04-??	BACKGROUND: The use of growth hormone (GH) in deficient adults has already been demonstrated to result in several benefits regarding metabolic parameters, body composition and quality of life. Due to the similarities between GH deficiency in adults and the aging process, the concept of somatopause has emerged.    OBJECTIVES: Correlate the GH secretion profile in healthy men older than 50 years with anthropometric parameters and exercise capacity.    PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy male were selected, with a mean age of 57.9+/-4.2 years (range 50-66). After hospital admission, body mass index (BMI), body composition (fat mass) and abdominal circumference, 24-h GH profile, GH peak and basal IGF-I were evaluated, and all the patients underwent a treadmill stress testing to estimate exercise capacity with the Bruce protocol, with evaluation of the maximum oxygen peak, maximum heart rate and METs. All the results are shown as mean+/-Std deviation: BMI -26.5+/-4.9kg/m2, percent fat…
29543816	Body position and motor imagery strategy effects on imagining gait in healthy adults: Results from a cross-sectional study.	aging	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND: Assessment of changes in higher levels of gait control with aging is important to better understand age-related gait instability, with the perspective to improve the screening of individuals at risk for falls. The comparison between actual Timed Up and Go test (aTUG) and its imagined version (iTUG) is a simple clinical way to assess age-related changes in gait control. The modulations of iTUG performances by body positions and motor imagery (MI) strategies with normal aging have not been evaluated yet. This study aims 1) to compare the aTUG time with the iTUG time under different body positions (i.e., sitting, standing or supine) in healthy young and middle age, and older adults, and 2) to examine the associations of body positions and MI strategies (i.e., egocentric versus allocentric) with the time needed to complete the iTUG and the delta TUG time (i.e., relative difference between aTUG and iTUG) while taking into consideration clinical characteristics of participants.  …
26011017	Education modifies the type of subjective memory complaints in older people.	aging	2016-02-??	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between the level of education and the profile of subjective memory complaints (SMC).    METHODS: Participants were healthy volunteers aged >50 years old, from a community-based sample. Educational attainment was self-reported, and participants were subsequently assembled in four groups, according to the highest grade achieved in school. Additionally, they were questioned about their own memory abilities using an SMC scale (total score 0-21) and assessed for the presence of depressive symptoms.    RESULTS: A total of 841 participants aged 50-92 years old were included. The mean total score on the SMC scale was 5.3 ± 3.2, and 80.4% of the subjects reported at least one minor complaint about their memory. There was no correlation between total SMC score and higher educational level, even after accounting for the presence of depressive symptoms. However, regarding specific SMC, the use of notes to avoid forgetting was more fre…
12068997	Oropharyngeal swallow in younger and older women: videofluoroscopic analysis.	aging	2002-06-??	Much of the initial research on normal swallowing has been conducted in young men. Recently, there has been increasing interest in determining whether there are differences between the sexes in swallowing function and in the effects of aging on swallowing in both sexes. This investigation examined the swallowing ability of 8 healthy young women between the ages of 21 and 29 and 8 healthy older women between the ages of 80 and 93 during two swallows each of 1 ml and 10 ml liquid boluses. Videofluoroscopic studies of these swallows were reviewed in slow motion and real time to confirm the absence of swallowing disorders. Kinematic analysis of each swallow was completed. Data on range of motion of pharyngeal structures and coordination characteristics of the oropharyngeal swallow were taken from this kinematic analysis. Position of the larynx at rest and length of neck were compared between the two groups. Data from this study were compared with previously published data on younger and ol…
29580255	Total energy expenditure in adults aged 65 years and over measured using doubly-labelled water: international data availability and opportunities for data sharing.	lifespan	2018-??-26	BACKGROUND: Increasing population lifespan necessitates a greater understanding of nutritional needs in older adults (65 year and over). A synthesis of total energy expenditure in the older population has not been undertaken and is needed to inform nutritional requirements. We aimed to establish the extent of the international evidence for total energy expenditure (TEE) using doubly-labelled water (DLW) in older adults (65 years and over), report challenges in obtaining primary data, and make recommendations for future data sharing.    METHODS: Four databases were searched to identify eligible studies; original research of any study design where participant level TEE was measured using DLW in participants aged ≥65 years. Once studies were identified for inclusion, authors were contacted where data were not publicly available.    RESULTS: Screening was undertaken of 1223 records; the review of 317 full text papers excluded 170 records. Corresponding or first authors of 147 eligible stud…
171539	Familial hyper-alpha-lipoproteinemia: studies in eighteen kindreds.	longevity	1975-11-??	A newly recognized familial hyperlipoproteinemia, familial hyper-alpha-lipoproteinemia, is described in 18 kindreds. Affected probands and relatives had distinctive elevations of alpha-lipoprotein cholesterol (C-HDL), slight elevations of total cholesterol, no elevation of LDL and VLDL cholesterol, and normal triglyceride levels. The proband and at least one additional first degree relative had distinctive elevations of C-HDL in 16 of 18 kindreds. Simple segregation analysis involving 84 offspring of 22 hyper-alpha X normal-alpha matings from these 16 kindreds revealed a ratio of hyper-alpha to normal of 37:47, a ratio not significantly different from 1:1 (chi 2(1) = 1.2), the ratio consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. Despite the suggestion of a major gene effect by this analysis, evaluation of the C-HDL distribution in kindred members failed to reveal bimodality, and familial correlation analysis revealed no parent-offspring correlation. The present data suggest that an e…
23824260	The relative roles of DNA damage induced by UVA irradiation in human cells.	aging	2013-08-??	UVA light (320-400 nm) represents approximately 95% of the total solar UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. UVA light induces oxidative stress and the formation of DNA photoproducts in skin cells. These photoproducts such as pyrimidine dimers (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, CPDs, and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts, 6-4PPs) are removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER). In this repair pathway, the XPA protein is recruited to the damage removal site; therefore, cells deficient in this protein are unable to repair the photoproducts. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of oxidative stress and the formation of DNA photoproducts in UVA-induced cell death. In fact, similar levels of oxidative stress and oxidised bases were detected in XP-A and NER-proficient cells exposed to UVA light. Interestingly, CPDs were detected in both cell lines; however, 6-4PPs were detected only in DNA repair-deficient cells. XP-A cells were also observed to be significan…
17526591	Tether extrusion from red blood cells: integral proteins unbinding from cytoskeleton.	aging	2007-08-15	We investigate the mechanical strength of adhesion and the dynamics of detachment of the membrane from the cytoskeleton of red blood cells (RBCs). Using hydrodynamical flows, we extract membrane tethers from RBCs locally attached to the tip of a microneedle. We monitor their extrusion and retraction dynamics versus flow velocity (i.e., extrusion force) over successive extrusion-retraction cycles. Membrane tether extrusion is carried out on healthy RBCs and ATP-depleted or -inhibited RBCs. For healthy RBCs, extrusion is slow, constant in velocity, and reproducible through several extrusion-retraction cycles. For ATP-depleted or -inhibited cells, extrusion dynamics exhibit an aging phenomenon through extrusion-retraction cycles: because the extruded membrane is not able to retract properly onto the cell body, each subsequent extrusion exhibits a loss of resistance to tether growth over the tether length extruded at the previous cycle. In contrast, the additionally extruded tether length …
28295567	Melatonin reverses H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -induced senescence in SH-SY5Y cells by enhancing autophagy via sirtuin 1 deacetylation of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB.	aging	2017-08-??	Autophagy, a degradation mechanism that plays a major role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and diminishes in aging, is considered an aging characteristic. Melatonin is an important hormone that plays a wide range of physiological functions, including the anti-aging effect, potentially via the regulation of the Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) pathway. The deacetylation ability of SIRT1 is important for controlling the function of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB). Apart from inflammation, NF-ĸB can regulate autophagy by inhibiting Beclin1, an initiator of autophagy. Although numerous studies have revealed the role of melatonin in regulating autophagy, very limited experiments have shown that melatonin can increase autophagic activity via SIRT1 in a senescent model. This study focuses on the effect of melatonin on autophagy via the deacetylation activity of SIRT1 on RelA/p65, a subunit of NF-ĸB, to determine whether melatonin can attenuate the aging condition. …
25356776	Aging of plasma-polymerized allylamine nanofilms and the maintenance of their cell adhesion capacity.	aging	2014-11-25	The long-term stability and γ-sterilisability of bioactive layers is the precondition for the application of implants. Thus, aging processes of a microwave deposited, plasma polymerized allylamine nanofilm (PPAAm) with positively charged amino groups were evaluated concerning physicochemical characteristics and cell adhesion capacity over the course of one year. XPS, FT-IR, surface free energy, and water contact angle measurements elucidated not only the oxidation of the PPAAm film due to atmospheric oxygen reacting with surface free radicals but also the influence of atmospheric moisture during sample storage in ambient air. Surprisingly, within 7 days 70% of the primary amino groups are lost and mostly converted into amides. A positive zeta-potential was verified for half a year and longer. Increasing polar surface groups and a water contact angle shift from 60° to 40° are further indications of altered surface properties. Nevertheless, MG-63 human osteoblastic cells adhered and spre…
19786795	Early puberty in internationally adopted girls: hormonal and clinical markers of puberty in 276 girls examined biannually over two years.	aging	2009-??-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retrospective studies have indicated that internationally adopted girls are at high risk of developing precocious puberty. Hypothetically, this could be due to selection bias. The aim of this study was to determine age at reaching pubertal milestones in healthy internationally adopted girls in a prospective, clinical study.    METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study including 276 randomly recruited internationally adopted girls. At baseline, age ranged from 4 to 13 years. Participants were followed with biannual examinations over a period of 2 years. Examinations included height, weight, Tanner staging, blood sampling and bone age assessment. Age distribution at entering pubertal stages B2-B5 (breast development), PH1-PH5 (pubic hair development) and menarche was estimated by probit analysis. Data were compared to a reference population of Danish-born girls, studied cross-sectionally.    RESULTS: Mean age at B2+ was 9.5 years (95% prediction interval 7.1-12.0 years) a…
20303378	Humor attenuates the cortisol awakening response in healthy older men.	aging	2010-05-??	This study examined the impact of an important factor contributing to successful aging, humor, on post-awakening cortisol levels among a group of 45 older men whose ages ranged from 64 years to 86 years (mean=73.6 years). Four saliva samples were collected from the participants for 2 days immediately after waking and every 15 min thereafter for three times. Cortisol data of the 2 days were aggregated for analysis. Two separate indices of cortisol awakening response reflecting the mean level of secretion and the rise from immediately to 45 min post-awakening, AUC(G) and AUC(I), were computed using the trapezoid formula. The relation of these two indices to humor (operationalized as coping) was examined in a multiple regression analysis while controlling for the effect of age, socioeconomic status, and self-esteem. Results indicated that higher humor scores were associated with lower AUC(G) but had no relation with AUC(I). Findings of the present study suggest that the hypothalamic-pitui…
26158356	The association of the sebum excretion rate with melasma, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, and rhytides.	aging	2015-06-16	BACKGROUND: Rosacea and melasma are two common skin conditions in dermatology. Both conditions have a predilection for the centrofacial region where the sebaceous gland density is the highest. However it is not known if sebaceous function has an association with these conditions.    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the relationship between facial glabellar wrinkle severity and facial sebum excretion rate for individuals with rosacea, melasma, both conditions, and in those with rhytides. Secondly, the purpose of this study was to utilize high resolution 3D facial modeling and measurement technology to obtain information regarding glabellar rhytid count and severity.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 subjects participated in the study. Subjects were divided into four groups based on facial features: rosacea-only, melasma-only, rosacea and melasma, rhytides-only. A high resolution facial photograph was taken followed by measurement of facial sebum excretion rate (SER).    RES…
29405429	Age-related differences in the functional properties of lips compared with skin.	aging	2018-08-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lips can easily become dry and rough and their biggest problems are drying and chapping. The cause of those problems is considered to be that the stratum corneum (SC) moisture is small and its barrier function is low. However, those problems decrease in subjects as they approach 40 years of age, after which problems due to their shape and color increase. The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between SC properties of the lips during aging and to clarify the cause(s) of lip problems.    METHODS: One hundred and 38 Japanese female subjects with normal skin ranging in age from 16 to 78 years were enrolled in the study. The capacitance and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values, viscoelasticity, and color of their lips were measured and compared with their cheeks.    RESULTS: The capacitance values for the lip and the cheek increased and TEWL values for both areas decreased with age. TEWL values for the lip decreased until ~30 years of age and this is …
21748449	Significance of nonrespiratory airflow during swallowing.	aging	2012-06-??	This study was designed to further our understanding of a potentially significant clinical event of negative nasal airflow near the end of the respiratory pause (inhibition) to accommodate swallowing. This negative flow, referred to as "SNIF," or swallow noninspiratory flow, occurs at the onset of airway reestablishment at the conclusion of the oropharyngeal swallow. Using simultaneous digital video fluoroscopic and nasal respiratory airflow recordings on 82 healthy adults (21-97 years old), the objectives of this study were to determine (1) the frequency of occurrence of SNIF during a 5-ml natural cup-drinking task, (2) differences in SNIF occurrence by age group, and (3) the temporal relationship between SNIF and other swallowing events. Results revealed that for most participants SNIF was observed in both swallowing trials. There was a statistically significant difference in SNIF occurrence by age category, with SNIF observed less frequently in the oldest participants. The peak onse…
19029251	Human UBN1 is an ortholog of yeast Hpc2p and has an essential role in the HIRA/ASF1a chromatin-remodeling pathway in senescent cells.	aging	2009-02-??	Cellular senescence is an irreversible proliferation arrest, tumor suppression process and likely contributor to tissue aging. Senescence is often characterized by domains of facultative heterochromatin, called senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which repress expression of proliferation-promoting genes. Given its likely contribution to tumor suppression and tissue aging, it is essential to identify all components of the SAHF assembly pathway. Formation of SAHF in human cells is driven by a complex of histone chaperones, namely, HIRA and ASF1a. In yeast, the complex orthologous to HIRA/ASF1a contains two additional proteins, Hpc2p and Hir3p. Using a sophisticated approach to search for remote orthologs conserved in multiple species through evolution, we identified the HIRA-associated proteins, UBN1 and UBN2, as candidate human orthologs of Hpc2p. We show that the Hpc2-related domain of UBN1, UBN2, and Hpc2p is an evolutionarily conserved HIRA/Hir-binding domain, which di…
29803837	Older Age Reduces Upper Esophageal Sphincter and Esophageal Body Responses to Simulated Slow and Ultraslow Reflux Events and Post-Reflux Residue.	aging	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear how age affects airway protective mechanisms. We investigated the effects of aging on upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and esophageal body pressure responses to slow and ultraslow simulated reflux events and post-reflux residue.    METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 11 elderly (74 ± 9 years old) and 11 young (28 ± 7 years old) healthy volunteers. Participants were placed in a supine position and evaluated by concurrent high-resolution impedance manometry and an esophageal infusion technique. Potential conditions of gastroesophageal reflux were simulated, via infusion of 0.1 N HCl and saline. UES and esophageal pressure responses were measured during the following: slow infusion (1 mL/s) for 60 seconds, 60 seconds of postinfusion dwell period, ultraslow infusion (0.05 mL/s) for 60 seconds, and 60 seconds of a postinfusion dwell period. All infusions were repeated 3 times. We used the UES high-pressure zone contractile integral (UES-CI) to det…
17460217	Glyoxal-induced premature senescence in human fibroblasts.	aging	2007-04-??	Mild stress-induced hormesis is an effective strategy to intervene in the aging process. Repeated exposure of human skin fibroblasts to 41 degrees C heat shock for 1 h twice a week is an example of mild stress that has many hormetic effects, including improved resistance to other stressors. We are now developing an experimental model system of sugar-induced premature senescence, which can be useful to test the hormetic and antiaging effects of other stresses. Our present studies show that early-passage human skin fibroblasts treated with 1 mM glyoxal for 72 h undergo premature senescence in terms of enlarged cell size, inhibition of cell division, slowing down of cell growth, a decrease in the number of DNA synthesizing cells, and increased resistance to apoptosis.
29073175	Dissociation between behavior and motor cortical excitability before and during ballistic wrist flexion and extension in young and old adults.	aging	2017-??-??	PURPOSE: Aging is associated with slow reactive movement generation and poor termination.    OBJECTIVE: We examined the hypothesis that the build-up of excitability in the primary motor cortex in the agonist muscle to generate ballistic wrist flexion and extension and in the antagonist to stop the movement, is lower and slower in old compared with young adults.    METHODS: We measured the size of the motor potentials evoked (MEP) produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), background integrated EMG (iEMG), and the MEP:iEMG ratio in healthy young (23 y, n = 14) and old adults' (73 y, n = 14) wrist flexors and extensors as they rapidly flexed or extended the wrist in response to an auditory cue. TMS was delivered at 80% of resting motor threshold randomly in 20 ms increments between 130 and 430 ms after the tone.    RESULTS: Even though old compared to young adults executed the two wrist movements with ~23% longer movement duration and ~15% longer reaction time (both p < 0.05), …
24322608	Aerobic exercise training increases plasma Klotho levels and reduces arterial stiffness in postmenopausal women.	aging	2014-02-??	The Klotho gene is a suppressor of the aging phenomena, and the secretion as well as the circulation of Klotho proteins decrease with aging. Although habitual exercise has antiaging effects (e.g., a decrease in arterial stiffness), the relationship between Klotho and habitual exercise remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of habitual exercise on Klotho, with a particular focus on arterial stiffness. First, we examined the correlation between plasma Klotho concentration and arterial stiffness (carotid artery compliance and β-stiffness index) or aerobic exercise capacity [oxygen uptake at ventilatory threshold (VT)] in 69 healthy, postmenopausal women (50-76 years old) by conducting a cross-sectional study. Second, we tested the effects of aerobic exercise training on plasma Klotho concentrations and arterial stiffness. A total of 19 healthy, postmenopausal women (50-76 years old) were divided into two groups: control group and exercise group. The exercise gro…
17448466	Analysis of betaB1-crystallin unfolding equilibrium by spin and fluorescence labeling: evidence of a dimeric intermediate.	aging	2007-05-15	A central step in understanding lens aging is to characterize the thermodynamic stability of its proteins and determine the consequences of changes in the primary sequence on their folding equilibria. For this purpose, destabilized mutations were introduced in betaB1-crystallin targeting the domain interface within the fold of a subunit. Global unfolding was monitored by tryptophan fluorescence while concomitant structural changes at the dimer interface were monitored by fluorescence and spin labels. Both spectral probes report explicit evidence of multi-state unfolding equilibrium. The biphasic nature of the unfolding curves was more pronounced at higher protein concentration. Distinct shifts in the midpoint of the second transition reflect the population of a dimeric intermediate. This intermediate may be a critical determinant for the life-long stability of the beta-crystallins and has important consequences on interactions with alpha-crystallin.
25387160	How Sedentary are Older People? A Systematic Review of the Amount of Sedentary Behavior.	aging	2015-07-??	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sedentary behavior (SB), defined as sitting (nonexercising), reclining, and lying down (posture), or by low energy expenditure, is a public health risk independent to physical activity. The objective of this systematic literature review was to synthesize the available evidence on amount of SB reported by and measured in older adults.    DATA SOURCE: Studies published between 1981 and 2014 were identified from electronic databases and manual searching. Large-scale population studies/surveys reporting the amount of SB (objective/ subjective) in older adults aged ≥ 60 years of age were included. Appraisal and synthesis was completed using MOOSE guidelines.    RESULTS: 349,698 adults aged ≥ 60 within 22 studies (10 countries and 1 EU-wide) were included. Objective measurement of SB shows that older adults spend an average of 9.4 hr a day sedentary, equating to 65-80% of their waking day. Self-report of SB is lower, with average weighted self-reports being 5.3 hr dail…
9464213	Effect of aging on cholecystokinin-induced panic.	aging	1998-02-??	OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic surveys have found that the incidence and prevalence of panic disorder decline in later life. The goal of this study was to determine whether aging has an effect on healthy subjects' responses to the panicogenic agent cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4).    METHOD: The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design: 40 subjects 20-35 years old and 40 subjects 65 years old or older were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of either 50 micrograms of CCK-4 or normal saline.    RESULTS: When given CCK-4, older subjects had significantly fewer and less intense symptoms of panic, shorter duration of symptoms, and less of an increase in heart rate than did younger subjects.    CONCLUSIONS: This study found an age-related change in responsiveness to CCK-4. Further research to delineate the mechanism of this change is warranted.
10872774	Degradation of mechanical behavior in UHMWPE after natural and accelerated aging.	aging	2000-07-??	Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is known to degrade during natural (shelf) aging following gamma irradiation in air, but the mechanical signature of degradation remains poorly understood. Accelerated aging methods have been developed to reproduce the natural aging process as well as to precondition total joint replacement components prior to joint simulator wear testing. In this study, we compared the mechanical behavior of naturally (shelf) aged and accelerated aged tibial inserts using a previously validated miniature specimen testing technique known as the small punch test. Tibial inserts made-of GUR 1120 and sterilized with 25 to 40 kGy of gamma radiation (in air) in 1988, 1993, and 1997 were obtained; a subset of the 1997 implants were subjected to 4 weeks of accelerated aging in air at 80 degrees C. To determine the spatial variation of mechanical properties within each insert, miniature disk shaped specimens were machined from the surface and subsurface regions…
23683351	The RECQL4 protein, deficient in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is active on telomeric D-loops containing DNA metabolism blocking lesions.	aging	2013-07-??	Telomeres are critical for cell survival and functional integrity. Oxidative DNA damage induces telomeric instability and cellular senescence that are associated with normal aging and segmental premature aging disorders such as Werner Syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome, caused by mutations in WRN and RECQL4 helicases respectively. Characterizing the metabolic roles of RECQL4 and WRN in telomere maintenance is crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of their associated disorders. We have previously shown that WRN and RECQL4 display a preference in vitro to unwind telomeric DNA substrates containing the oxidative lesion 8-oxoguanine. Here, we show that RECQL4 helicase has a preferential activity in vitro on telomeric substrates containing thymine glycol, a critical lesion that blocks DNA metabolism, and can be modestly stimulated further on a D-loop structure by TRF2, a telomeric shelterin protein. Unlike that reported for telomeric D-loops containing 8-oxoguanine, RECQL4 does not …
27496922	Association of socioeconomic status and cognitive functioning change among elderly Chinese people.	longevity	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: the inverse association between high socioeconomic status and impaired cognitive functioning in old age has been widely studied. However, it is still inconclusive whether higher socioeconomic status slows the rate of cognitive decline over ageing, especially in non-Western populations. We examined this association using a large population-based longitudinal survey of older Chinese persons.    METHODS: the sample came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) (from the years 2002 to 2011, N = 15,798 at baseline, aged 65-105). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) based on face-to-face interviews was used to assess cognitive functioning. Socioeconomic status was assessed using educational attainment and household income per capita. Latent growth curve and selection model considering the attrition during the follow-up were utilised to assess the effect of socioeconomic status on the rate of change in cognitive functioning.    RESULTS: at b…
24406253	Cockayne Syndrome group B protein stimulates NEIL2 DNA glycosylase activity.	aging	2014-01-??	Cockayne Syndrome is a segmental premature aging syndrome, which can be caused by loss of function of the CSB protein. CSB is essential for genome maintenance and has numerous interaction partners with established roles in different DNA repair pathways including transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. Here, we describe a new interaction partner for CSB, the DNA glycosylase NEIL2. Using both cell extracts and recombinant proteins, CSB and NEIL2 were found to physically interact independently of DNA. We further found that CSB is able to stimulate NEIL2 glycosylase activity on a 5-hydroxyl uracil lesion in a DNA bubble structure substrate in vitro. A novel 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyA) specific incision activity of NEIL2 was also stimulated by CSB. To further elucidate the biological role of the interaction, immunofluorescence studies were performed, showing an increase in cytoplasmic CSB and NEIL2 co-localization after oxidative stress. Addi…
28366000	Comparison between Malolactic Fermentation Container and Barrel Toasting Effects on Phenolic, Volatile, and Sensory Profiles of Red Wines.	aging	2017-04-26	Ellagitannin and anthocyanin profiles, woody volatile composition, and sensory properties of wines in which malolactic fermentation (MLF) took place in barrels or stainless steel tanks, have been compared after 12 months of barrel aging. Three different barrel toastings were evaluated. Barrel-fermented wines generally presented 1.2-fold higher total phenolics, whereas tank-fermented wines exhibited 1.1- and 1.2-fold greater total proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin contents, respectively. Concerning ellagitannin composition, the barrel toasting effect seemed to be more important than differences due to MLF container. Certain woody and fruity volatiles varied significantly (p < 0.05) depending on whether MLF occurred in barrels or tanks. Barrel-fermented wines were preferred in the mouth, whereas olfactory preference depended on barrel toasting. This is the first study that evaluates the impact of oak wood during MLF on ellagitannin wine composition, as well as the barrel toasting effect o…
2014146	Oxidative stress in newborn erythrocytes.	aging	1991-02-??	Phenylhydrazine (PHZ) exposure is used to study in vitro red cell aging mechanisms dependent on Hb oxidation. The effect of PHZ on normal neonatal red blood cells was studied in unseparated blood and after separation into light and heavy cells. PHZ caused more extensive morphologic changes in neonatal than in adult red blood cells. PHZ exposure of neonatal cells caused less reduced glutathione depletion than in adult cells. Although we found the same total amount of oxidized Hb in both cells, a well-defined oxidation product of Hb was demonstrated by Mössbauer spectra only in neonatal cells. This oxidation product was not methemoglobin but a trivalent, high-spin iron compound. All neonatal cell populations were more sensitive to PHZ than were adult ones, as demonstrated by the presence of Heinz bodies at low PHZ concentration, which did not affect adult cells. These studies demonstrate greater sensitivity of neonatal cells to PHZ in all density-separated populations.
26855826	High-gamma power changes after cognitive intervention: preliminary results from twenty-one senior adult subjects.	aging	2016-??-??	INTRODUCTION: Brain-imaging techniques have begun to be popular in evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive intervention training. Although gamma activities are rarely used as an index of training effects, they have several characteristics that suggest their potential suitability for this purpose. This pilot study examined whether cognitive training in elderly people affected the high-gamma activity associated with attentional processing and whether high-gamma power changes were related to changes in behavioral performance.    METHODS: We analyzed (MEG) magnetoencephalography data obtained from 35 healthy elderly subjects (60-75 years old) who had participated in our previous intervention study in which the subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three types of intervention groups: Group V trained in a vehicle with a newly developed onboard cognitive training program, Group P trained with a similar program but on a personal computer, and Group C was trained to solve a crossword …
10852460	Blood micronutrient and thyroid hormone concentrations in the oldest-old.	aging	2000-06-??	Several micronutrients are involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, but it is unclear whether their marginal deficits may contribute to the alterations in thyroid function observed in extreme aging. The relationships among blood concentrations of thyroid hormones and selenium, zinc, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol were studied in 44 healthy Northern Italian oldest-old subjects (age range, 90-107 yr), selected by the criteria of the SENIEUR protocol. Control groups included 44 healthy adult (age range, 20-65 yr) and 44 SENIEUR elderly (age range, 65-89 yr) subjects. Oldest-old subjects had higher TSH (P < 0.01) and lower free T3 (FT3)/freeT4 (FT4) ratio, zinc, and selenium serum values (P < 0.001) than adult and elderly control subjects. No significant difference was found for plasma retinol and a-tocopherol values. The associations between micronutrients and thyroid hormones were evaluated by multivariate analysis. In oldest-old subjects, plasma retinol was negatively associated with FT4 …
7295190	Lipoproteins in familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia.	longevity	????-??-??	Familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia is determined by a major gene and is characterized by high levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and longevity. To describe the plasma lipoproteins in this condition more completely, a kindred consisting of the proband, her affected father, add her two affected brothers was studied. Fasting plasmas were analyzed for lipoprotein lipids by combined preparative ultracentrifugal and precipitation methods. Levels of apolipoprotein A-1 and apolipoprotein A-11, the major apoproteins of high density lipoproteins, were assayed by radioimmunoassay. The flotation properties of very low density, low density and high density lipoprotein were determined by zonal ultracentrifugation, and the isolated high density lipoprotein subfractions were characterized according to their lipid and apoprotein compositions. Total cholesterol of all subjects was normal, but triglycerides were elevated (above the 90th percentile) in the two brothers. High density lipoprotei…
15389598	Down-regulation of p21WAF1 promotes apoptosis in senescent human fibroblasts: involvement of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and delay of cellular aging.	aging	2004-12-??	It has been suggested that genes which exercise checkpoint control during cell cycle traverse are equally important to the process of apoptotic cell death. In this study, we show that the key cell cycle regulatory gene p21(WAF1) is also involved in the execution of apoptosis. p21(WAF1) expression was down-regulated during NaBu-induced apoptosis of senescent normal diploid human 2BS fibroblasts. Conversely, when p21(WAF1) expression was actively suppressed in 2BS cells by a stably transfected antisense p21(WAF1) construct, apoptosis was accelerated and senescence was delayed, as shown by several markers of cell aging. Down-regulation of p21(WAF1) by antisense caused an increase in the phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb. Phosphorylation of pRb was further enhanced upon induction of apoptosis by NaBu. Our results suggest that p21(WAF1), acting through the phosphorylation of pRb, regulates whether 2BS cells cease to proliferate and become senescent but resistant to apoptosis, or wheth…
23681344	The relationship between geriatric depression and health-promoting behaviors among community-dwelling seniors.	aging	2013-06-??	BACKGROUND: People older than 65 years old account for about 10.9% of Taiwan's total population; it is also known that the older adults experience a higher incidence of depression. Public health nurses play an important role in promoting community health. Policymaking for community healthcare should reflect the relationship between health-promoting behavior and depression in community-dwelling seniors. Therefore, the encouragement of healthy aging requires strategic planning by those who provide health promotion services.    OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to elicit the health-promoting behaviors of community seniors and investigate the relationship between geriatric depression and health-promoting behaviors among seniors who live in rural communities.    METHODS: We used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and collected data using a demographic information datasheet, the Health Promotion for Seniors and Geriatric Depression Scale short forms.    RESULTS: The study included 427 pa…
8951236	Synthesis and 31P chemical shift identification of tripeptide active site models that represent human serum acetylcholinesterase covalently modified at serine by certain organophosphates.	aging	1996-12-??	Most organophosphorus (OP) insecticides impart their toxic action via inhibition of cholinesterases by reacting at an essential serine hydroxyl group. The inhibition process is dependent upon the reactivity, stereochemistry, leaving group, and the mechanism of phosphorylation and/or reactivation (or aging) inherent to the OP compound under consideration. Because a wide array of phosphorylated structures are possible following inhibition by an OP, a simple model system was sought to investigate the mechanistic details of these and related reactions. In the present study, the tripeptide N-CBZ-Glu-Ser(OH)-Ala-OEt (chosen as a truncated form of human serum cholinesterase) was chemically modified at the serine hydroxyl group by various O-methyl phosphate groups and the 31P NMR chemical shift recorded. Six tripeptides, representing (a) phosphorylation by dimethyl phosphorothionates (N-CBZ-Glu-Ser[O-P(S)(OMe)2]Ala-OEt; 5), (b) phosphorylation by dimethyl phosphates (N-CBZ-Glu-Ser[O-P(O)(OMe)2…
28247211	Data set of healthy old people assessed for three walking conditions using accelerometric and opto-electronic methods.	aging	2017-12-??	BACKGROUND: Gait patterns of healthy aging are needed to allow a comparison with pathological situations. However, little data is available.    OBJECTIVE: To present gait pattern of healthy older specially selected to be "healthy walkers".    METHOD: Fifty-seven older people benefited from a geriatric assessment including clinical and functional evaluations to include only those without gait disorders. Gait data were simultaneously recorded using a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the waist and four 3D position markers placed on the feet at the level of the heel and the toe. Volunteers walked at comfortable self-selected speed (CW), fast self-selected speed (FW), and finally in dual task walking condition (DTW). The extracted gait parameters were: gait speed, stride length, stride frequency, regularity and symmetry, swing, stance and double support time and ratio and minimum toe clearance. Gait speed and stride length were normalized to the right leg length.    RESULTS: Fifty-seven ol…
8504166	Expression and alternative splicing of fibronectin mRNA in human diploid endothelial cells during aging in vitro.	aging	1993-05-28	Different mRNAs for fibronectin arise from the variable processing of a single primary transcript. We used ribonuclease protection assay to investigate the changes occurring in fibronectin expression and the alternative splicing of mRNA precursor during aging in vitro of human diploid endothelial cells. Senescent endothelial cells release more protein and contain 4-5-fold more fibronectin mRNA than young cells. The pattern of alternative splicing of fibronectin mRNA, with the EDA and the CS1 segments largely included (35% and 77%, respectively) and the EDB segment undetectable, correlates well with previous studies at the protein level both in vitro and in vivo. No changes in the splicing pattern of fibronectin mRNA precursor were detected during endothelial cellular senescence. The increased expression of fibronectin in senescent cells may be a result of the activity of interleukin-1 alpha, which is overexpressed in senescent endothelial cells. It could be also important in vivo durin…
10520969	Saliva, salivary micro-organisms, and oral health in the home-dwelling old elderly--a five-year longitudinal study.	aging	1999-10-??	High scores of chair-side salivary microbial tests have been found to be related to an increased prevalence and incidence of coronal and root caries. Many elderly face an increased risk of the growth of oral microbes, and previous studies have reported high salivary microbial counts in elderly populations. The aim of this follow-up study was to compare, at five-year intervals, stimulated salivary flow rates with the numbers of selected salivary micro-organisms (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and yeasts) in a group of home-dwelling elderly in Helsinki. A further aim was to study the influence of baseline microbial counts on five-year root caries increments and rates of tooth loss. The baseline study population was comprised of 270 subjects who were all participants in the population-based Helsinki Aging Study. Salivary flow rates and microbial conditions were determined as part of their dental examination at the Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki, in 1990-1991. Of these …
17226061	Postural differences in hemodynamics and diastolic function in healthy older men.	aging	2007-04-??	The shift from upright to supine posture increases stroke volume in healthy young adults, primarily through increased end-diastolic volume. Aging is associated with increased ventricular stiffness and impaired diastolic function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the stroke volume change between the upright and supine posture was blunted in healthy older men and whether the early mitral inflow response to this postural change was reduced by aging. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging were used to assess stroke volume and left ventricular function during upright and supine posture in 10 young and 12 older healthy men. Cardiac output was greater in the supine versus upright condition in both groups. In young men supine posture was associated with a large increment in stroke volume (63.1 +/- 7.2 upright to 98.6 +/- 11.7 ml supine; P < 0.05) and a decrease in heart rate. In older men, the stroke volume increment was smaller (63.9 +/- 3.6 upright to 82…
28874721	Aging-related changes in the diversity of women's skin microbiomes associated with oral bacteria.	aging	2017-??-05	Skin aging is associated with changes in cutaneous physiology including interactions with a skin microbial community. A striking alteration and diversification in the skin microbiome with aging was observed between two different age groups of 37 healthy Japanese women, i.e. younger adults of 21-37 years old and older adults of 60-76 years old, using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The analyses revealed that the alpha diversity/species richness was significantly higher in the older than the younger group for the cheek and forehead microbiomes, while the beta diversity in the overall structure significantly differed particularly for the forearm and scalp microbiomes between the two age groups. Taxonomic profiling showed a striking reduction in the relative abundance of the majority skin genus Propionibacterium in the cheek, forearm and forehead microbiomes of the older adults, and identified 38 species including many oral bacteria that significantly differentiated the two age groups …
23049256	Cell-penetrating superoxide dismutase attenuates oxidative stress-induced senescence by regulating the p53-p21(Cip1) pathway and restores osteoblastic differentiation in human dental pulp stem cells.	aging	2012-??-??	BACKGROUND: Human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have potential applications in tissue regeneration because of their convenient cell harvesting procedures and multipotent capacity. However, the tissue regenerative potential of DPSCs is known to be negatively regulated by aging in long-term culture and under oxidative stress. With an aim of reducing cellular senescence and oxidative stress in DPSCs, an intracellular delivery system for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was developed. We conjugated SOD1 with a cell-penetrating peptide known as low-molecular weight protamine (LMWP), and investigated the effect of LMWP-SOD1 conjugates on hydrogen peroxide-induced cellular senescence and osteoblastic differentiation.    RESULTS: LMWP-SOD1 significantly attenuated enlarged and flattened cell morphology and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Under the same conditions, LMWP-SOD1 abolished activation of the cell cycle regulator proteins, p53 and p21(Cip1), induced by hydrogen…
1270716	Menu planning in the Nutrition Program for the Elderly. Modified Nutrient Standard Menu method.	aging	1976-06-??	A nutrient standard menu (NSM) planning method was developed for use in planning menus which provided one-third the Recommended Dietary Allowances for persons sixty years of age or older for nine indicator nutrients and calories, while restricting fat to less than 40 per cent of total calories. To eliminate manual calculations and make it easy for individuals untrained in dietetics or nutrition to use NSM planning, the nutrient composition of over a thousand commonly used menu items was listed in a menu planning manual in nutrient units which were one-tenth of the nutrient standard for the meal. Menus from third-party sources were monitored by selecting similar nutritionally analyzed menu items in the manual and adjusting the nutrient composition to conform to the portions actually served. Ten site managers of the Administration on Aging (AoA) evaluated the planning/monitoring method. The members of the group, on the average, were fifty-six years of age, had 1.6 years of education beyo…
24034698	The Chinese version of the world health organization quality of life instrument-older adults module (WHOQOL-OLD): psychometric evaluation.	aging	2013-09-16	BACKGROUND: Under the circumstance of global population aging, the issue on how to facilitate the quality of life (QOL) for older people brings us grand challenge. On the way to solve this problem, it is inextricable to measure QOL for older people accurately at onset. This study is aimed at evaluating the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module (WHOQOL-OLD).    METHODS: We received 1005 valid WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires from 1050 respondents who were 60 and older by quota sampling method. To calculate the test-retest correlation coefficient we re-interviewed 101 participants from the community. Psychometric properties were evaluated from the aspect of feasibility, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, content validity, construct validity and discriminant validity.    RESULTS: Missing item responses took up 0.0%-2.7% in the scale. The WHOQOL-OLD showed satisfactory reliability wit…
19038485	Access to healthcare services makes a difference in healthy longevity among older Chinese adults.	longevity, aging	2009-01-??	The positive impact of access to healthcare on health and survival among older adults is well-documented in Western societies. However, whether the pattern still holds in developing countries where healthcare coverage is more limited is largely unknown. China, a developing country with the largest population in the world, has been transforming its antiquated healthcare system during the past few decades in response to rapid population aging. Yet, in recent years the lack of access to healthcare has been identified as the top concern by most citizens in China. We used the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey and the community-level data sources from the National Bureau of Statistics of China to examine the impact of current as well as childhood access to healthcare services on subsequent three-year survival and healthy survival at old ages from 2002 to 2005 under a multilevel context. Healthy survival was measured by a cumulative deficit index calculated from thirty-nine variab…
15731343	Oxidative damage in telomeric DNA disrupts recognition by TRF1 and TRF2.	aging	2005-??-??	The ends of linear chromosomes are capped by protein-DNA complexes termed telomeres. Telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2) bind specifically to duplex telomeric DNA and are critical components of functional telomeres. Consequences of telomere dysfunction include genomic instability, cellular apoptosis or senescence and organismal aging. Mild oxidative stress induces increased erosion and loss of telomeric DNA in human fibroblasts. We performed binding assays to determine whether oxidative DNA damage in telomeric DNA alters the binding activity of TRF1 and TRF2 proteins. Here, we report that a single 8-oxo-guanine lesion in a defined telomeric substrate reduced the percentage of bound TRF1 and TRF2 proteins by at least 50%, compared with undamaged telomeric DNA. More dramatic effects on TRF1 and TRF2 binding were observed with multiple 8-oxo-guanine lesions in the tandem telomeric repeats. Binding was likewise disrupted when certain intermediates of base excision repai…
23240041	Identification of novel interacting partners of Sirtuin6.	aging	2012-??-??	SIRT6 is a member of the Sirtuin family of histone deacetylases that has been implicated in inflammatory, aging and metabolic pathways. Some of its actions have been suggested to be via physical interaction with NFκB and HIF1α and transcriptional regulation through its histone deacetylase activity. Our previous studies have investigated the histone deacetylase activity of SIRT6 and explored its ability to regulate the transcriptional responses to an inflammatory stimulus such as TNFα. In order to develop a greater understanding of SIRT6 function we have sought to identify SIRT6 interacting proteins by both yeast-2-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies. We report a number of interacting partners which strengthen previous findings that SIRT6 functions in base excision repair (BER), and novel interactors which suggest a role in nucleosome and chromatin remodeling, the cell cycle and NFκB biology.
25931172	Nutrition behavior of the middle-aged and elderly: Compliance with dietary recommendations of the food pyramid.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND & AIMS: During the aging process, human physiology changes noticeably, mostly to the disadvantage of the individual. A healthy lifestyle that includes sufficient physical activity as well as a balanced and diverse diet contributes to healthy aging. One key factor that elderly people need to be aware of is compliance with nutritional recommendations. There is very little data concerning eating patterns, consumption behavior, and compliance with food guides (food pyramid) and nutritional recommendations among the Swiss, particularly for the middle-aged and elderly. The objective of this study was to gather new and representative information about these issues, concentrating on people aged 50+ and living in Switzerland.    METHODS: A questionnaire in online and written form was distributed to a representative sample of middle-aged and elderly people living in Switzerland.    RESULTS: In total, 632 people returned the survey. Of those respondents, 71% knew the Swiss Food Pyramid…
26725043	Work ability and associated factors of Brazilian technical-administrative workers in education.	aging	2016-01-02	BACKGROUND: Studies about work ability have grown in importance owing to the worldwide aging of active populations. Research has shown that measuring work ability has a predictive value in cases of long-term sickness absence and early retirement. Our goal was to analyze the work ability and associated factors of civil servants from a higher education institution in Brazil. The participants in this cross-sectional study were 600 technical-administrative workers at a public university. Work ability was measured using the work ability index.    RESULTS: The participants were as follows: 51.8% male; mean age of 45 years (SD = ±11); married or in a stable union (61.5%); holding a graduate degree (56.7%); having only one job (83.3%), working 40 h a week or less (78.6%); not working evenings (79.8%); and having direct contact with the public (58.3%). The prevalence of reduced work ability was 13.9%. The following factors were found to be associated with reduced work ability: age 50 years old …
23366704	Electromyographic study in 5 muscles during an isometric fatiguing protocol.	aging	2012-??-??	In this study, 12 healthy men aging 22.8 ± 2.2 years old were submitted to a protocol of isometric resistance to fatigue contemplating elbow flexion on three different angles: 45°, 90° and 135°. The objective was to study electromyographic median frequency (MDF) in the following muscles: i) Biceps Brachialis Long Head (BBL), Brachioradialis (BRD), Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS), Triceps Brachialis Long Head (TBL), and Extensor Digitorum (ED). It was verified that, for all muscles, including the muscles that act in opposition to the contraction, fatigue presence was verified by the decrease of MDF value.
15575275	Lead phosphate minerals: solubility and dissolution by model and natural ligands.	aging	2004-11-01	Due to their relatively low solubility, lead-phosphate minerals may control Pb solution levels at a low value in natural environments. We reportthe solubility of Pb from two lead-orthophosphate mineral suspensions (beta-Pb9(PO4)6 and PbHPO4) after aging for 3 years. Lead (Pb2+) activity in the aged suspensions was compared to the activity calculated using the Ksp values of various Pb-PO4 minerals reported in the literature. We also determine the time-dependent dissolution of the aged lead-phosphate minerals by organic and inorganic ligands containing S-functional groups (cysteine, methionine, and thiosulfate) and by a soil extracted humic acid. We find the activity of Pb2+ in the aged lead-phosphate suspensions to be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than predicted by the Ksp values reported in the literature. Disagreement between measured and Ksp-calculated activities has been reported in other investigations of Pb-PO4 minerals; we compiled some of the data and present them together with…
16485520	Effects of strength training and nutritional counseling on metabolic health indicators in aging women.	aging	2005-12-??	PURPOSE: Effects of strength training (ST) and nutritional counseling (NC) on metabolic health indicators were examined in 50 aging women.    METHODS: Subjects performed ST for 21 weeks. NC was given to obtain sufficient energy and protein intake, and recommended intake of fat and fiber.    RESULTS: NC increased intake of protein and polyunsaturated fat by 4.5% and 10.7% and decreased intake of saturated fat by 18.3%. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), total and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and triacylglycerols (TAG) decreased, and serum HDL-C increased in all subjects after ST. Respectively, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum insulin concentration decreased in all subjects. NC contributed to the decreases in levels of serum LDL-C after the first half of ST and serum TC and HDL-C ratio during both ST periods. Changes in serum TAG concentrations correlated positively with intake of carbohydrates, and negatively with monounsaturated fat…
21695420	Copper ability to induce premature senescence in human fibroblasts.	longevity	2012-08-??	Human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) exposed to subcytotoxic concentrations of oxidative or stressful agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide, or ethanol, undergo stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). This condition is characterized by the appearance of replicative senescence biomarkers such as irreversible growth arrest, increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA β-gal) activity, altered cell morphology, and overexpression of several senescence-associated genes. Copper is an essential trace element known to accumulate with ageing and to be involved in the pathogenesis of some age-related disorders. Past studies using either yeast or human cellular models of ageing provided evidence in favor of the role of intracellular copper as a longevity modulator. In the present study, copper ability to cause the appearance of senescent features in HDFs was assessed. WI-38 fibroblasts exposed to a subcytotoxic concentration of copper sulfate presented inhibition of …
24265834	Age-related decline in associative learning in healthy Chinese adults.	aging	2013-??-??	Paired associates learning (PAL) has been widely used in aging-related research, suggesting an age-related decline in associative learning. However, there are several cognitive processes (attention, spatial and recognition memory, strategy, and associative learning) involved in PAL. It is unclear which component contributes to the decline in PAL performance associated with age effects. The present study determines whether age effects on associative learning are independent of other cognitive processes involved in PAL. Using a validated computerized cognitive program (CANTAB), we examined cognitive performance of associative learning, spatial and recognition memory, attention and strategy use in 184 Singaporean Chinese adults aged from 21 to 80 years old. Linear regression revealed significant age-related decline in associative learning, spatial and recognition memory, and the level of strategy use. This age-related decline in associative learning remains even after adjusting for attent…
21212314	Autophagic activity and aging in human odontoblasts.	aging	2011-04-??	Odontoblasts are long-lived post-mitotic cells in the dental pulp, whose function is to form and maintain dentin. The survival mechanisms that preserve the viability of terminally differentiated odontoblasts during the life of a healthy tooth have not been described. In the present study, we characterized the autophagic-lysosomal system of human odontoblasts with transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, to analyze the mechanisms that maintain the functional viability of these dentinogenic cells. Odontoblasts were found to develop an autophagic-lysosomal system organized mainly by large autophagic vacuoles that are acid-phosphatase-positive to various degrees. These vacuoles expressed the autophagosomal and lysosomal markers LC3 and LAMP2, respectively, in an age-related pattern indicating the organization of a dynamic autophagic machinery. Progressive accumulation of lipofuscin within lysosomes indicates reduced lysosomal activity as a function of odontoblast aging. Ou…
25635946	Social priming improves cognitive control in elderly adults--evidence from the Simon task.	aging	2015-??-??	We examined whether social priming of cognitive states affects the inhibitory process in elderly adults, as aging is related to deficits in inhibitory control. Forty-eight elderly adults and 45 young adults were assigned to three groups and performed a cognitive control task (Simon task), which was followed by 3 different manipulations of social priming (i.e., thinking about an 82 year-old person): 1) negative--characterized by poor cognitive abilities, 2) neutral--characterized by acts irrelevant to cognitive abilities, and 3) positive--excellent cognitive abilities. After the manipulation, the Simon task was performed again. Results showed improvement in cognitive control effects in seniors after the positive manipulation, indicated by a significant decrease in the magnitude of the Simon and interference effects, but not after the neutral and negative manipulations. Furthermore, a healthy pattern of sequential effect (Gratton) that was absent before the manipulation in all 3 groups a…
17413134	Physical activity and the risk of dementia in oldest old.	aging	2007-04-??	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the protective role of physical activity (PA) against cognitive impairment (CI) in the oldest old (age >/= 85).    METHOD: Prospective data on 66 optimally healthy, oldest old adults (mean age 88.5) were analyzed using survival analysis.    RESULTS: In all, 12 men and 11 women reported exercising > 4 hours per week, and 38 participants developed CI (mean onset age 93; mean follow-up 4.7 years). The effect of exercise was modified by gender. In more active women (> 4 hours/week), the risk of CI was reduced by 88% (95% confidence interval 0.03, 0.41) compared to those less active. Less active women had 2 times the incidence rate of CI compared to less active men and almost 5 times the rate compared to active women.    DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the beneficial effects of exercise on healthy brain aging even in the oldest old and emphasizes the importance of increasing PA in older women.
16690127	Differential regulation of interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) splice variants.	aging	2007-02-??	IRAK family proteins play critical roles in regulating innate immunity. There are three differentially spliced variants of IRAK1, namely 1, 1b, and 1c. We and others have previously identified that the full length IRAK1 underwent covalent modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination upon lipopolysaccharide challenge. In this report, we observed that IRAK1 could also undergo sumoylation which was responsible for its translocation into the nucleus. In contrast, IRAK1c remained stable and did not undergo modification upon various challenges. Furthermore, we showed that IRAK1c solely localized in the cytoplasm. IRAK1 was absent and IRAK1c was the primary form in human brains. The absence of full length IRAK1 and presence of IRAK1c may keep brain tissue in a resting non-inflammatory state. Intriguingly, the full length IRAK1 form was consistently detected in brain tissues obtained from aged humans, suggesting that differential splicing of IRAK1 may correlate with the aging proce…
9326820	Does growing old increase the risk for depression?	aging	1997-10-??	OBJECTIVE: Most research examining age as a risk factor for depression has been based on cross-sectional data. To investigate the effect of aging on rates of depression prospectively, the authors used two waves of data from a panel study of community residents 50 years old and older.    METHOD: Data on symptoms of major depressive episodes were examined for the 1994 and 1995 cohorts of the Alameda County Study. The authors examined age, gender, marital status, education, financial strain, chronic medical conditions, functional impairment, cognitive problems, life events, neighborhood problems, social isolation, and social support. Depression was measured with 12 items covering DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes.    RESULTS: Point prevalence of major depressive episodes was 8.7% in 1994 and 9.0% in 1995. Among the subjects 60 years old and older, there was a tendency toward higher prevalence in 1995. The highest prevalence rates in 1994 and in 1995 were among those…
12045841	Effects of aerobic exercise training on heart rate variability during wakefulness and sleep and cardiorespiratory responses of young and middle-aged healthy men.	aging	2002-06-??	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic physical training (APT) on heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiorespiratory responses at peak condition and ventilatory anaerobic threshold. Ten young (Y: median = 21 years) and seven middle-aged (MA = 53 years) healthy sedentary men were studied. Dynamic exercise tests were performed on a cycloergometer using a continuous ramp protocol (12 to 20 W/min) until exhaustion. A dynamic 24-h electrocardiogram was analyzed by time (TD) (standard deviation of mean R-R intervals) and frequency domain (FD) methods. The power spectral components were expressed as absolute (a) and normalized units (nu) at low (LF) and high (HF) frequencies and as the LF/HF ratio. Control (C) condition: HRV in TD (Y: 108, MA: 96 ms; P<0.05) and FD - LFa, HFa - was significantly higher in young (1030; 2589 ms2/Hz) than in middle-aged men (357; 342 ms2/Hz) only during sleep (P<0.05); post-training effects: resting bradycardia (P<0.05) in the aw…
11521947	Hyaluronan affects protein and collagen synthesis by in vitro human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2001-08-??	Given the importance of hyaluronan (HA) for the homeostasis of connective tissues during embryogenesis and aging and its role in tissue repair, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of exogenous HA on the synthesis of total protein, collagen and HA by in vitro human dermal fibroblasts. With differences between different cell strains, HA, at concentrations between 0.5 and 1 microM, induced a significant decrease in total protein synthesised and secreted into the medium compared to controls (P < 0.05), and particularly in collagen (-40%; P < 0.05). The ratios between collagen types I and III and between collagen types V and I were normal. Pulse and chase experiments showed that protein degradation was normal. The presence of exogenous HA did not affect HA synthesis. Data strongly indicate that a relatively high concentration of HA in the extracellular space, such as during development and in the first phases of tissue repair, would partially limit the deposition of the e…
25041334	Skin photoprotection and consumption of coffee and polyphenols in healthy middle-aged Japanese females.	aging	2015-04-??	BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species are known to mediate skin photoaging, which results in the formation of pigmented spots and wrinkles. Coffee is the largest source of polyphenols, which supplies a large number of antioxidants in one's daily life. However, little is known about how much coffee and polyphenol consumption influences skin health. In this study, a cross-sectional survey of the diet, environmental factors, and skin conditions was conducted in healthy Japanese females to explore the influence of coffee and polyphenol consumption on skin conditions.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-smoking, healthy female subjects with moderate sun exposure in their daily lives were recruited for this study (n = 131, age range: 30-60 years old) and recorded their food and beverage intake and life circumstances using questionnaires. The skin water content, transepidermal water loss, and elasticity were measured on the cheek of each subject using non-invasive methods: a Corneometer, a Tewameter,…
28011195	Protective role of klotho protein on epithelial cells upon co-culture with activated or senescent monocytes.	aging	2017-01-15	Monocytes ensure proper functioning and maintenance of epithelial cells, while good condition of monocytes is a key factor of these interactions. Although, it was shown that in some circumstances, a population of altered monocytes may appear, there is no data regarding their effect on epithelial cells. In this study, using direct co-culture model with LPS-activated and Dox-induced senescent THP-1 monocytes, we reported for the first time ROS-induced DNA damage, reduced metabolic activity, proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest followed by p16-, p21- and p27-mediated DNA damage response pathways activation, premature senescence and apoptosis induction in HeLa cells. Also, we show that klotho protein possessing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory characteristics reduced cytotoxic and genotoxic events by inhibition of insulin/IGF-IR and downregulation of TRF1 and TRF2 proteins. Therefore, klotho protein could be considered as a protective factor against changes caused by altered mono…
25156086	Sonographic appearances of cervical lymph nodes in healthy young Japanese adults: Association with age, sex, and body mass index.	aging	2015-06-??	PURPOSE: We investigated whether there was any association between age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) and nodal morphology and vascular pattern in healthy young Japanese adults.    METHODS: Three neck regions in 100 healthy subjects, 19-40 years old, were examined by gray-scale and color Doppler sonography. Vascular pattern was classified into three groups: avascular, hilar, or scattered. A linear mixed-effect model was used to identify associations of age, sex, or BMI with the short-axis diameter and the short-to-long axis diameter ratio (S/L). A cumulative link mixed model was used to identify any association between age, sex, BMI, and vascular pattern.    RESULTS: In the upper cervical region, a decrease in the short-axis diameter was statistically significantly associated with aging (p = 0.04), and an increase in the short-axis diameter was significantly associated with greater BMI (p < 0.001). An increase in short-axis diameter was significantly associated with female sex (p = 0.…
15247747	Is there a clinical relevance of partial androgen deficiency of the aging male?	aging	2004-08-??	PURPOSE: Aging in men is characterized by a progressive, generally moderate decrease in plasma testosterone (T) levels and T substitution is increasingly prescribed. However, the association of partial androgen deficiency of the aging male with clinical symptoms and the ideal screening test are controversial. We investigate the association between various T measures and clinical and biochemical parameters of the aging male.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the association between total (TT), calculated free (FTcalc) and bioavailable (BT) testosterone, and various clinical and biochemical parameters in 51 healthy community living male volunteers, 55 and 75 years old. The parameters included serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol and lipid profile after an overnight fast; questionnaires assessing clinical symptoms, erectile function and mood; bone mineral density and body composition.    RESULTS: TT correlated with FTcalc (r2 = 0.71, p <0.001) but not with BT (r…
26336817	Association between Elder Mistreatment and Suicidal Ideation among Community-Dwelling Chinese Older Adults in the USA.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND: Elder mistreatment and suicidal ideation are important public health concerns among aging populations. However, very few studies have been conducted to explore the association between elder mistreatment and suicidal ideation.    OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between elder mistreatment and suicidal ideation among Chinese older adults in the USA.    METHODS: Guided by a community-based participatory research approach, in this study we conducted in-person interviews with Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older in the Greater Chicago area from 2011 to 2013. Elder mistreatment was assessed by a 10-item instrument derived from the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (H-S/EAST) and the Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale (VASS). Suicidal ideation was assessed by the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Geriatric Mental State Examination-Version A (GMS-A).    RESULTS: Overall, 3,159 Chinese older adults participated in this study…
21234650	Phe27Cys polymorphism of the human delta opioid receptor predisposes cells to compromised calcium signaling.	aging	2011-05-??	A quarter of the human population with European background carries at least one allele of the OPRD1 gene that encodes the delta opioid receptor with cysteine at the amino acid position 27 (hδOR(Cys27)) instead of the evolutionary conserved phenylalanine (hδOR(Phe27)). The two variants have indistinguishable pharmacological properties but, importantly, hδOR(Cys27) differs from hδOR(Phe27) in having low maturation efficiency, lower stability at the cell surface and pronounced intracellular location. Both variants were previously shown to interact with the Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca²+ ATPase (SERCA) 2b in the early phase of their biosynthesis. We analyzed by pulse-chase assays, whether cellular signaling can affect hδOR(Cys27) maturation. Neither activation of the receptor by a δOR-specific agonist Leu-enkephalin, induction of intracellular calcium (Ca²+) release by ATP nor the direct stimulation of SERCA 2b by protein kinase C activation affected receptor maturation in HEK-293 cells…
30346973	Associations between sedentary time, physical activity and bone health among older people using compositional data analysis.	aging	2018-??-??	INTRODUCTION: Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in bone mass (BM), and being physical active is one of the main strategies to combat this continuous loss. Nonetheless, because daily time is limited, time spent on each movement behavior is co-dependent. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BM and movement behaviors in elderly people using compositional data analysis.    METHODS: We analyzed 871 older people [395 men (76.9±5.3y) and 476 women (76.7±4.7y)]. Time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was assessed using accelerometry. BM was determined by bone densitometry (DXA). The sample was divided according to sex and bone health indicators.    RESULTS: The combined effect of all movement behaviors (PA and SB) was significantly associated with whole body, leg and femoral region BM in the whole sample (p≤0.05), with leg and pelvic BM (p<0.05) in men and, with whole body,…
7115424	Effects of hydrocortisone and aspirin on protein synthesis and post-translational protein modification in cultured cells.	aging	1982-06-01	Arginyl-tRNA transferase is suggested to function as a post-translational modifier of proteins through the addition of arginine to the NH2-terminus of specific acceptor proteins. Both hydrocortisone and aspirin produced an age-dependent stimulation of protein synthesis in normal human fibroblasts (IMR90), while producing an inhibition of protein synthesis in SV40 virus-transformed IMR90 cells. The effect of aspirin was confined primarily to the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas hydrocortisone produced its effect at both cytoplasmic and nuclear levels. Neither hydrocortisone nor aspirin had a direct effect on arginyl-tRNA transferase activity in vitro; however, hydrocortisone resulted in a marked increase in the availability of chromosomal proteins subject to modification by arginyl-tRNA transferase. This stimulatory effect was attenuated by increasing culture age. The modified chromosomal proteins were found to be dissociated from native chromatin, suggesting that arginylation either tr…
22025204	Relevance of in-vitro tests of adhesive and composite dental materials. A review in 3 parts. Part 2: non-standardized tests of composite materials.	aging	2011-??-??	Summary The first part of this review examined ISO approval requirements and in vitro testing. In the second part, non-standardized test methods for composite materials are presented and discussed. Physical tests are primarily described. Analyses of surface gloss and alterations, as well as aging simulations of dental materials are presented. Again, the importance of laboratory tests in determining clinical outcomes is evaluated. Differences in the measurement protocols of the various testing institutes and how these differences can influence the results are also discussed. Because there is no standardization of test protocols, the values determined by different institutes cannot be directly compared. However, the ranking of the tested materials should be the same if a valid protocol is applied by different institutes. The modulus of elasticity, the expansion after water sorption, and the polishability of the material are all clinically relevant, whereas factors measured by other test …
1585197	Health status of the aged: medical profile of a group of functional elderly.	aging	1992-05-??	By studying a group of very elderly but generally functional people, we have compiled a medical profile that helps describe health-related characteristics of effective aging. We obtained functional, nutritional, and biochemical information regarding 61 men and women (mean age 86.8 years) attending a veterans' convention. Twenty-three out of 60 (38%) reported a fall in the previous year, with those who were less physically active falling more than the most active. Many of the men were thin or had lost weight, but at most 3 of the 25 male subjects were clinically malnourished. Many of the women were heavy but were otherwise healthy. Of the 36 women, 6 (17%) had an elevated level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Five of 58 (9%) had low vitamin B12 levels. Even in the older old who seem to be aging well, falling is relatively common, and screening for certain laboratory abnormalities has a reasonably high yield.
12093281	Deamidation in human gamma S-crystallin from cataractous lenses is influenced by surface exposure.	aging	2002-07-09	A major component of human nuclear cataracts is water-insoluble, high molecular weight protein. A significant component of this protein is disulfide bonded gamma S-crystallin that can be reduced to monomers by dithiothreitol. Analysis of this reduced gamma S-crystallin showed that deamidation of glutamine and asparagine residues is a principal modification. Deamidation is one of the modifications of lens crystallins associated with aging and cataractogenesis. One proposed hypothesis of cataractogenesis is that it develops in response to altered surface charges that cause conformational changes, which, in turn, permit formation of disulfide bonds and crystallin insolubility. This report, showing deamidation among the disulfide bonded gamma S-crystallins from cataractous lenses, supports this hypothesis.
2995426	SV40-transformed human fibroblasts: evidence for cellular aging in pre-crisis cells.	lifespan, aging	1985-10-??	Pre-crisis SV40-transformed human diploid fibroblast (HDF) cultures have a finite proliferative lifespan, but they do not enter a viable senescent state at end of lifespan. Little is known about either the mechanism for this finite lifespan in SV40-transformed HDF or its relationship to finite lifespan in normal HDF. Recently we proposed that in normal HDF the phenomena of finite lifespan and arrest in a viable senescent state depend on two separate processes: 1) an age-related decrease in the ability of the cells to recognize or respond to serum and/or other mitogens such that the cells become functionally mitogen-deprived at the end of lifespan; and 2) the ability of the cells to enter a viable, G1-arrested state whenever they experience mitogen deprivation. In this paper, data are presented that suggest that pre-crisis SV40-transformed HDF retain the first process described above, but lack the second process. It is shown that SV40-transformed HDF have a progressively decreasing abil…
20890289	Reduced histone biosynthesis and chromatin changes arising from a damage signal at telomeres.	aging	2010-10-??	During replicative aging of primary cells morphological transformations occur, the expression pattern is altered and chromatin changes globally. Here we show that chronic damage signals, probably caused by telomere processing, affect expression of histones and lead to their depletion. We investigated the abundance and cell cycle expression of histones and histone chaperones and found defects in histone biosynthesis during replicative aging. Simultaneously, epigenetic marks were redistributed across the phases of the cell cycle and the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery was activated. The age-dependent reprogramming affected telomeric chromatin itself, which was progressively destabilized, leading to a boost of the telomere-associated DDR with each successive cell cycle. We propose a mechanism in which changes in the structural and epigenetic integrity of telomeres affect core histones and their chaperones, enforcing a self-perpetuating pathway of global epigenetic changes that ultimat…
15648443	Collagen-like peptide exhibits a remarkable antiwrinkle effect on the skin when topically applied: in vivo study.	aging	2004-??-??	In this double-blind clinical study, we evaluated the effect of our newly developed synthetic collagen-like hexapeptide on wrinkles. Twenty healthy women volunteers, aged 40 to 62 years old, participated in the study Volunteers applied either a gel formula containing 3% of the collagen-like peptide and 1% of a booster molecule that stimulates general cell metabolism with no specific effect on wrinkles, or a placebo gel, on the eye zone area twice a day for 4 weeks. Control visits were performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Skin wrinkles were evaluated clinically and by silicon replica analysis followed by statistical treatment using the matched-pairs Student's t-test. The results showed that application of the collagen-like peptide on the skin significantly reduced the total surface of wrinkles and this effect was observed in 75% of the replicas. Similarly, the decrease in number and average depth of wrinkles was also significant and was observed in 65% and 75% of the rep…
11595405	Accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, and change of repair systems during in vitro cellular aging of cultured human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2001-11-01	Effects of in vitro cellular aging on the content of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, a typical oxidation product of DNA bases, were examined in cultured human skin fibroblasts. The 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine content in the DNA of TIG-3S cells established from skin tissues of a fetal donor increased immediately before the cessation of proliferation. TIG-114 and TIG-104 cells established from skin tissues of adult and aged donors, respectively, showed similar changes in 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine content during in vitro cellular aging. The accumulation of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in late-passage cells was dependent on the number of cell divisions, and not on the cultivation time. Increases in the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were observed prior to the increase in 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine content, while the catalase activity decreased gradually during in vitro cellular aging at late-passage. Furthermore, the activities of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine endonuclease and DNA poly…
20152798	IKKbeta specifically binds to P16 and phosphorylates Ser8 of P16.	aging	2010-03-12	In spite of its central roles in cell cycle progression, senescence, and aging, knowledge about the posttranslational regulation of P16 (also known as INK4A and MTS1) remains limited. While it has been reported that P16 could be phosphorylated at Ser7, Ser8, Ser140, and Ser152, the corresponding kinases have not been identified yet. Here we report that IKKbeta, a primary kinase for IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, is involved in P16 phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation and kinase assays showed that IKKbeta specifically binds to P16 and phosphorylates P16 at Ser8 in WI38 cells. Biochemical characterization of phosphomimetic Ser-->Glu P16 mutants demonstrated that phosphorylation at Ser8 of P16 brings about a significant loss of its cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4-inhibitory activity while P16 retains structurally and functionally intact upon phosphorylation at Ser7, Ser140, and Ser152. Our results reveal the novel role of IKKbeta in P16 phosphorylation and broaden our understanding of the …
14698805	Replicative senescence and the art of counting.	aging	????-??-??	The idea that aging is largely the result of (endogenous) stress appears to be at odds with the concept of biological 'clocks', which seem to programme and terminate cellular aging processes. Here, data are reviewed that show that telomeres, the major clock identified in human cells so far, do in fact measure stress and damage accumulation much more than simple mitotic time. Telomere shortening is significantly stress-dependent due to a telomere-specific damage repair deficiency. This identifies telomere-driven human cell replicative senescence as a stress response with high potential importance for human aging.
22808196	Increases in mitochondrial DNA content and 4977-bp deletion upon ATM/Chk2 checkpoint activation in HeLa cells.	aging	2012-??-??	Activation of the Mec1/Rad53 damage checkpoint pathway influences mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and point mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effects of this conserved checkpoint pathway on mitochondrial genomes in human cells remain largely unknown. Here, we report that knockdown of the human DNA helicase RRM3 enhances phosphorylation of the cell cycle arrest kinase Chk2, indicating activation of the checkpoint via the ATM/Chk2 pathway, and increases mtDNA content independently of TFAM, a regulator of mtDNA copy number. Cell-cycle arrest did not have a consistent effect on mtDNA level: knockdown of cell cycle regulators PLK1 (polo-like kinase), MCM2, or MCM3 gave rise, respectively, to decreased, increased, or almost unchanged mtDNA levels. Therefore, we concluded that the mtDNA content increase upon RRM3 knockdown is not a response to delay of cell cycle progression. Also, we observed that RRM3 knockdown increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); two ROS scav…
17937407	Examining the influence of short-term implantation on oxidative degradation in retrieved highly crosslinked polyethylene tibial components.	aging	2008-05-??	Concerns remain regarding the oxidative resistance of highly crosslinked polyethylene (PE). The study investigated the in vivo performance of Durasul highly crosslinked PE by comparing the oxidation index, density, and percent crystallinity in the weightbearing and nonweightbearing region of retrieved components with unused time zero tibial components. Retrieved and unused Sulene conventional PE tibial components were examined for comparison and the effects of shelf age, in vivo duration, and ex vivo duration were also investigated. The oxidation index was not significantly different between unused time zero and retrieved Durasul PE components. Regression analysis data supported these findings in that neither shelf age, in vivo duration, nor ex vivo duration was a significant predictor of oxidation index in the retrieved Durasul PE components. In contrast, the retrieved conventional PE components had significantly greater oxidation index, density, and percent crystallinity compared wit…
22678651	Walking for recreation and perceptions of the neighborhood environment in older Chinese urban dwellers.	aging	2013-02-??	Engagement in walking for recreation can contribute to healthy aging. Although there is growing evidence that the neighborhood environment can influence walking for recreation, the amount of such evidence in relation to older adults is scarce and limited to Western low-density urban locations. Asian urban environments are typified by distinctive environmental and cultural characteristics that may yield different patterns to those observed in Western countries. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine associations of perceived environmental attributes with overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation in Chinese elders (65+ years) residing in Hong Kong, an ultradense Asian metropolis. A sample of 484 elders was recruited from 32 neighborhoods stratified by socio-economic status and walkability (dwelling and intersection densities). Validated questionnaires measuring perceived neighborhood environment and weekly minutes of overall and within-neighborhood walking for …
30520439	The effect of aging and gender on plantar pressure distribution during the gait in elderly.	aging	2018-??-??	PURPOSE: The effect of age on structural foot characteristics as well as on the plantar pressure distribution has been shown previously. However, the number of studies focused also on gender gait differences of elderly is lacking. The purpose of this study was to compare dynamic gait characteristic in younger and older elderly and to investigate the gender differences as the life-long load and footwear choice differ in males and females.    METHODS: 61 healthy elderly participants were divided by age and gender into four groups: males 60-69, males 70-79, females 60-69 and females 70-79 years old. Plantar pressures were recorded during barefoot walking at naturally chosen speed using Emed-at (Novel GmbH, Germany). Three steps of the left foot of each participant were used for further analysis, furthermore, hallux angle, foot progression angle, and arch index were calculated by the Emed software from obtained foot- prints. To compare the differences between the analyzed groups, effect si…
17955544	Brain, skull, and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in adult posttraumatic stress disorder.	aging	2007-10-??	Children and adolescents with maltreatment-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit smaller intracranial tissue volume than controls. Linear relationships have also been observed between intracranial tissue volume and the age of maltreatment onset. The authors explored associations among adult PTSD, early trauma, and cerebral volumes in 99 combat veterans. A bone-based estimate of cranial volume was developed to adjust for variation in body size. Posttraumatic stress disorder was not associated with smaller cerebral tissue volume, but rather with smaller cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cranial volumes. These findings co-occurred with expected effects of alcoholism and aging on cerebral tissue and CSF volumes. The results point to early developmental divergences between groups with and without PTSD following adult trauma.
29256922	Sleep disturbance in mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review of recent findings.	aging	2018-??-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Research interest in sleep as a risk factor for dementia has grown, warranting an update in advances over the last 18 months, particularly in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage in which interventions may be best targeted.    RECENT FINDINGS: The current systematic review includes empiric research articles published since 2016 that have investigated sleep (excluding obstructive sleep apnea) in MCI. Published articles include case-control studies, those examining clinical correlates of sleep problems, sleep microarchitecture, neuroimaging studies and novel cerebrospinal and blood-based markers.    SUMMARY: Evidence accumulated since 2016 continues to demonstrate that people with MCI manifest sleep disturbance on self-report measures. Neurophysiologically, sleep disturbance in MCI appears to be associated with diminished sleep spindles, key processes involved in overnight memory consolidation. Those with both MCI and sleep disturbance appear to have more pronounc…
23832841	Accumulation of sensory difficulties predicts fear of falling in older women.	aging	2013-08-??	OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the accumulation of sensory difficulties predicts fear of falling (FOF), and whether the traits correlate with each other regardless of familial factors.    METHODS: Self-reported hearing, vision and balance difficulties, and FOF were assessed using structured questionnaires at the baseline and after a 3-year follow-up in 63- to 76-year-old women (n = 434).    RESULTS: Among the women without FOF at baseline (n = 245), 41% reported FOF at follow-up. Increasing numbers of sensory difficulties at baseline predicted higher incidence of FOF. The relationship between accumulated sensory difficulties and FOF was not mediated by familial factors.    DISCUSSION: The accumulation of multiple sensory difficulties may hinder older people from receiving compensatory information about body position and environment, thus jeopardizing a person's confidence in maintaining a balanced position. Regular screening of sensory functions followed by appropriate actions may preve…
28038898	Demographic and Systemic Hemodynamic Influences in Mechanisms of Cerebrovascular Regulation in Healthy Adults.	aging	2017-03-??	OBJECTIVES: A competent cerebrovascular regulation maintains an adequate cerebral blood flow by 3 major mechanisms: cerebral autoregulation (CA), vasomotor reactivity (VMR), namely to CO, and neurovascular coupling (NVC). However, most studies generalize their results based on a response to a single parameter. Using a full battery of neurovascular stress tests, our study aims to evaluate the relationships among grades of CA, VMR, and NVC, and how their interplay is influenced by demographic and systemic hemodynamic factors.    METHODS: Fifty-eight healthy adults were recruited to fit each decade age stratum from 20 to 80 years old with similar sex ratio. Arterial blood pressure (Finometer), cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries (transcranial Doppler), electrocardiogram, and end-tidal CO were monitored. We assessed CA by transfer function analysis, VMR at hypocapnia and hypercapnia (carbogen 5%), and NVC response during the N-Back Task. The Montreal Cognitive Asse…

The protective properties of ectoine, formerly described for only extremophilic microorganisms, can be transferred to human skin. Our present data show that the compatible solute ectoine protects the cellular membrane from damage caused by surfactants. Transepidermal water loss measurements in vivo suggest that the barrier function of the skin is strengthened after the topical application of an oil in water emulsion containing ectoine. Ectoine functions as a superior moisturizer with long-term efficacy. These findings indicating that ectoine is a strong water structure-forming solute are explained in silico by means of molecular dynamic simulations. Spherical clusters containing (1) water, (2) water with ectoine, and (3) water with glycerol are created as model systems. The stronger the water-binding activity of the solute, the greater the quantity of water molecules remaining in the cluster at high temperatures. Water clusters around ectoine molecules remain stable for a long period o…
15743671	The signals and pathways activating cellular senescence.	aging	2005-05-??	Cellular senescence is a program activated by normal cells in response to various types of stress. These include telomere uncapping, DNA damage, oxidative stress, oncogene activity and others. Senescence can occur following a period of cellular proliferation or in a rapid manner in response to acute stress. Once cells have entered senescence, they cease to divide and undergo a series of dramatic morphologic and metabolic changes. Cellular senescence is thought to play an important role in tumor suppression and to contribute to organismal aging, but a detailed description of its physiologic occurrence in vivo is lacking. Recent studies have provided important insights regarding the manner by which different stresses and stimuli activate the signaling pathways leading to senescence. These studies reveal that a population of growing cells may suffer from a combination of different physiologic stresses acting simultaneously. The signaling pathways activated by these stresses are funneled t…
16131135	Effect of accelerated autolysis of yeast on the composition and foaming properties of sparkling wines elaborated by a champenoise method.	aging	2005-09-07	Five mutants (obtained by UV mutagenesis) and the parent strain were selected to produce sparkling wines following the traditional or champenoise method. The wines were aged with the yeast for 9 months, with samples being taken each month for analytical and sensory determinations. The wines elaborated with mutant strain IFI473I demonstrated an accelerated release of protein, amino acids, and polysaccharides. An analysis of the secreted polysaccharides revealed that mannose was the major sugar present. The effects of the products released by yeasts on the foaming properties of the wines were determined by both sensory and instrumental analysis. In all cases, the wines elaborated with mutant strain IFI473I showed improved foaming properties as compared to wines fermented without this strain. Similar results were obtained at a decreased aging time of 6 months, thereby confirming the capacity of IFI473I strain to carry out an accelerated autolysis. These results demonstrate that mutant str…
24705557	Geometry is a major determinant of flow reversal in proximal aorta.	aging	2014-05-15	The aim of this study is to quantify aortic backward flow (BF) using phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR) and to study its associations with age, indexes of arterial stiffness, and geometry. Although PC-CMR blood flow studies showed a simultaneous presence of BF and forward flow (FF) in the ascending aorta (AA), the relationship between aortic flows and aging as well as arterial stiffness and geometry in healthy volunteers has never been reported. We studied 96 healthy subjects [47 women, 39 ± 15 yr old (19-79 yr)]. Aortic stiffness [arch pulse wave velocity (PWVAO), AA distensibility], geometry (AA diameter and arch length), and parameters related to AA BF and FF (volumes, peaks, and onset times) were estimated from CMR. Applanation tonometry carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWVCF), carotid augmentation index, and time to return of the reflected pressure wave were assessed. Whereas FF parameters remained unchanged, BF onset time shortened significantly (R(2) =…
28073999	Everyday Support to Aging Parents: Links to Middle-Aged Children's Diurnal Cortisol and Daily Mood.	aging	2018-??-13	Purpose of the Study: Middle-aged adults are often called upon to support aging parents. However, providing support to an aging parent with health problems and disability may be a stressful experience. This study asked whether giving everyday support to parents in the context of health problems and disability has implications for middle-aged children's diurnal cortisol and daily mood.    Design and Methods: During four consecutive days, 148 middle-aged adults (mean age = 55) reported the support they gave to their parents and provided saliva 4 times a day (wake, 30 min post-wake, lunchtime, and bedtime). Multilevel models estimated within-person differences in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), cortisol awakening response and area under the curve with respect to ground (AUC-G) as a function of giving same-day and previous-day support. We examined whether these associations are exacerbated when a parent has health problems or activities of daily living (ADL) needs.    Result…
11426935	Heat-induced proteasomic degradation of HSF1 in serum-starved human fibroblasts aging in vitro.	aging	2001-07-15	The exposure of human fibroblasts (HF) aging in vitro to heat shock resulted in an attenuated expression of the heat shock-inducible HSP70. When late passage cells were cultured in the continuous presence of serum, we observed a reduced accumulation of the cytoplasmic polyadenylated HSP70 mRNA. The levels of HSF1 activation and nuclear HSP70 mRNA were comparable to those of early passage cells (M. A. Bonelli et al., Exp. Cell Res. 252, 20-32, 1999). When late passage cells were serum-starved overnight, we observed a reduced activation of HSF1 and a decreased level of HSP70 mRNA during heat shock. However, at 37 degrees C the levels of HSF1 differed little between late passage HF and early passage cells, irrespective of the presence of serum. Interestingly, during heat shock a marked decrease in the level and, consequently, in the binding activity of HSF1 was noted only in serum-starved, late passage HF. The decrease in the level of HSF1 was counteracted by back addition of serum to the…
27109895	Dynamics of human acetylcholinesterase bound to non-covalent and covalent inhibitors shedding light on changes to the water network structure.	aging	2016-??-14	We investigated the effects of non-covalent reversible and covalent irreversible inhibitors on human acetylcholinesterase and human butyrylcholinesterase. Remarkably a non-covalent inhibitor, Huperzine A, has almost no effect on the molecular dynamics of the protein, whereas the covalently binding nerve agent soman renders the molecular structure stiffer in its aged form. The modified movements were studied by incoherent neutron scattering on different time scales and they indicate a stabilization and stiffening of aged human acetylcholinesterase. It is not straightforward to understand the forces leading to this strong effect. In addition to the specific interactions of the adduct within the protein, some indications point towards an extensive water structure change for the aged conjugate as water Bragg peaks appeared at cryogenic temperature despite an identical initial hydration state for all samples. Such a change associated to an apparent increase in free water volume upon aging s…
1435766	Retardation of cell aging by lipid peroxidation.	aging	1992-09-22	Different concentrations of Fe2+/vitamin C mixtures were used as initiators of lipid peroxidation in diploid fibroblasts from cultured human embryonic lung. Malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in the cell cultures was correlated directly with the concentrations of Fe2+ and vitamin C. Lipid peroxidation was associated with an increase in life-span, decrease in the population doubling time and increase in cellular DNA synthesis. The effects of lipid peroxidation varied inversely with the MDA level. These data showed that low levels of lipid peroxidation retarded several biological properties of cultured cells that are associated with cell aging.
21820037	A new human dyskerin isoform with cytoplasmic localization.	aging	2011-12-??	BACKGROUND: The human DKC1 gene is causative of X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (X-DC), a syndrome characterized by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, tumor susceptibility, perturbation of stem cell function, and premature aging. DKC1 is thought to produce a single protein, named dyskerin, which shows strict nucleolar localization and participates in at least two distinct nuclear functional complexes: the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteic complex involved in RNA pseudouridylation and the active telomerase complex.    METHODS: By bioinformatics and molecular analyses we identified a DKC1 splice variant able to encode a truncated form of dyskerin, confirmed its active expression in diverse human tissues by RT-PCR, and showed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry experiments that it actually encodes a novel protein. Stably transfected clones over-expressing the new isoform were analyzed for growth, morphology and adhesion properties.    RESULTS: Our results show that D…
16959884	Progestin negatively affects hearing in aged women.	aging	2006-09-19	Female hormone influences on auditory system aging are not completely understood. Because of widespread clinical use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it is critical to understand HRT effects on sensory systems. The present study retrospectively analyzed and compared hearing abilities among 124 postmenopausal women taking HRT, treated with estrogen and progestin (E+P; n = 32), estrogen alone (E; n = 30), and a third [non-hormone replacement therapy (NHRT; n = 62)] control group. Subjects were 60-86 years old and were matched for age and health status. All had relatively healthy medical histories and no significant noise exposure, middle-ear problems, or major surgeries. Hearing tests included pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient otoacoustic emissions, and the hearing-in-noise test (HINT). The HINT tests for speech perception in background noise, the major complaint of hearing-impaired persons. Pure-tone thresholds in both …
16456195	Aged men experience disturbances in recovery following submaximal exercise.	aging	2006-01-??	BACKGROUND: Physiological responses to exercise of moderate intensity and duration among aged compared to young adults have yet to be clearly defined. Further, the effects of aging on the rate and effectiveness of postexercise recovery are unknown.    METHODS: Here, selected physiological responses during and following exercise of the same relative intensity were examined in untrained young and aged men.    RESULTS: Generally, the two groups displayed similar responses during 30 minutes of exercise. During recovery, however, numerous age-related differences were manifested. Relative heart rate (% peak) was higher during recovery among the aged group. Postexercise lactate remained increased longer among aged men, and blood glucose regulation was impaired during recovery. This difference in circulating glucose was associated with insulin responses whereby young, but not aged men experienced a postexercise spike. Unlike that in young men, rectal temperature among aged men continued to inc…
16673881	Gene-specific and mitochondrial repair of oxidative DNA damage.	aging	2006-??-??	The Southern blot gene-specific DNA damage and repair assay is a robust and flexible method for quantifying many kinds of induced damage and repair with high reproducibility. Specific nicking and loss of a restricted DNA fragment at the site of induced damage is visualized by Southern blot and quantified against a control; since the blot is gene specific, only the damage of interest is measured. Here we show how the assay may be adapted to assess mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. In the mitochondrion, 8-oxoguanine is a significant oxidative lesion; in the laboratory, photoactivated methylene blue may be used to introduce this lesion into cells. Other lesions may also be studied by using different DNA damaging agents. We find that damage induction by methylene blue is consistently far greater in the mitochondrion than the nucleus. Thus advantageously, mitochondrial 8-oxoguanine repair may be studied without mtDNA isolation or preparation, which are processes known to induce DNA damage a…
29378515	The effects of an 8-week computerized cognitive training program in older adults: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	aging	2018-??-30	BACKGROUND: Given the world's aging population, it is important to identify strategies that promote healthy cognitive aging and minimize cognitive decline. Currently, no curative pharmaceutical therapy exists for cognitive impairment and dementia. As a result, there is much interest in lifestyle approaches. Specifically, complex mental activity, such as cognitive training, may be a promising method to combat cognitive decline in older adults. As such, the industry of commercial computerized cognitive training (CCT) applications has rapidly grown in the last decade. However, the efficacy of these commercial products is largely not established. Moreover, exercise is a recognized strategy for promoting cognitive outcomes in older adults and may augment the efficacy of computerized cognitive training applications. Therefore, we propose a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effect of a commercial CCT program in community-dwelling older adults.    METHODS: An 8-…
2988653	5'-Nucleotidase activities in human fetus.	aging	1985-??-??	Specific 5'-nucleotidase (5'-N) activity in 17 human fetuses was systemically studied in order to get basic values of the enzyme activity. A wide spectrum of 5'-N activity among the organs was revealed. Very strong activity was found in placenta (42.62 +/- 19.24 nmol adenosine/mg protein/min), skeletal muscle (31.80 +/- 11.10) and skin (27.31 +/- 13.00); strong activity in liver (18.96 +/- 7.60), pituitary (15.06 +/- 6.13) and thyroid (12.69 +/- 4.47); moderate activity in lung (8.43 +/- 3.68), pancreas (8.20 +/- 2.26), small intestine (8.07 +/- 2.28), lymph node (7.26 +/- 2.22), thymus (7.06 +/- 2.52), spinal cord (5.86 +/- 1.96) and spleen (5.65 +/- 2.52), and weak activity in testis (4.02 +/- 0.79), heart (3.95 +/- 1.22), adrenal (3.46 +/- 1.68), kidney (3.16 +/- 0.83), ovary (3.16 +/- 0.72), aorta (2.98 +/- 1.20), cerebellar hemisphere (2.28 +/- 1.09) and frontal lobe of the cerebrum (1.49 +/- 0.54). These data are the first to be reported on specific 5'-N activity in the human fet…
1166138	Static recoil of the lungs and static compliance in healthy children.	aging	1975-??-??	The static lung compliance was studied in 57 healthy children, 6 to 14 years old. A new method called ' end-expiratory-compliane' (C1 EE) has been developed and the results were compared to the data obtained from ZAPLETAL et al. with the 'static pressure-volume' curves technique. The advantages of the method are discussed. The static lung compliance of children increases with height. Static lung compliance value is greater than dynamic lung compliance. This difference is discussed. Static recoil pressure of the lung was measured by the oesophageal baloon technique at so-called 'zero volume' of air in the balloon. At functional residual capacity (FRC), i.e. 41-44% total lung capacity (TLC), static recoil pressure is negative in all children, according to this technique. The taller the child, the more negative is the intrathoracic pressure at the same lung volume in percent of TLC, the slopes of the P/V curve being significantly different in younger and in older children. These data are …
19172989	Increased expression of the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome truncated lamin A transcript during cell aging.	aging	2009-07-??	Most cases of the segmental progeroid syndrome, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), are caused by a de novo dominant mutation within a single codon of the LMNA gene. This mutation leads to the increased usage of an internal splice site that generates an alternative lamin A transcript with an internal deletion of 150 nucleotides, called lamin A Delta 150. The LMNA gene encodes two major proteins of the inner nuclear lamina, lamins A and C, but not much is known about their expression levels. Determination of the overall expression levels of the LMNA gene transcripts is an important step to further the understanding of the HGPS. In this study, we have performed absolute quantification of the lamins A, C and A Delta 150 transcripts in primary dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients and unaffected age-matched and parent controls. We show that the lamin A Delta 150 transcript is present in unaffected controls but its expression is >160-fold lower than that in samples from HGPS patien…
15379407	Comparison of nutritional risk between urban and rural elderly.	aging	2004-05-??	Urban and rural elderly face a multitude of barriers to healthy aging and maintaining adequate nutrition. Looking at commonalties and differences between urban and rural elderly that are associated with nutritional risk is an important first step in identifying and correcting nutritional insufficiencies. To examine health behaviors and nutritional information associated with nutritional risk in urban and rural areas and to develop a profile of nutritional risk for rural and urban elderly, data from one retrospective and two prospective studies were analyzed. One hundred, eighty-three (183) urban-living and 167 rural-living older adults (average age 77 years old) participated in the studies. More than 60% of participants were women. Overall health ratings were significantly higher for urban than for rural elderly. Rural dwellers had significantly fewer dental visits (41% versus 76%) but higher albumin values than their urban counterparts. Results from the synthesis of these four studies…
21092904	Microoxidation in wine production.	aging	2010-??-??	Microoxygenation (MOX) is now widely applied for the maturation of red wines as an alternative to barrel aging. The proposed improvements in wine quality arising from MOX include color stabilization, removal of unwanted off-odors, and improvements in wine mouthfeel. In this review, an outline is provided of oxygenation systems, particularly microbullage and polymer membrane delivery, and of the current understanding of wine oxidation processes. A summary of the results from published studies into red wine MOX is then provided, beginning with observations on O(2) and acetaldehyde accumulation, and the moderating effect of added sulfur dioxide. Effects upon red wine color, particularly the more rapid formation of polymeric pigments and higher color retention, have been consistently demonstrated in MOX studies, along with further effects on specific polyphenol compounds. A few reports have recently examined the effect of MOX on red wine aromas, but these have yet to identify compounds tha…
20191607	An optimized chemical synthesis of human relaxin-2.	aging	2010-04-??	Human gene 2 relaxin (RLX) is a member of the insulin superfamily and is a multi-functional factor playing a vital role in pregnancy, aging, fibrosis, cardioprotection, vasodilation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. RLX is currently applied in clinical trials to cure among others acute heart failure, fibrosis, and preeclampsia. The synthesis of RLX by chemical methods is difficult because of the insolubility of its B-chain and the required laborious and low yielding site-directed combination of its A (RLXA) and B (RLXB) chains. We report here that oxidation of the Met(25) residue of RLXB improves its solubility, allowing its effective solid-phase synthesis and application in random interchain combination reactions with RLXA. Linear Met(O)(25)-RLX B-chain (RLXBO) reacts with a mixture of isomers of bicyclic A-chain (bcRLXA) giving exclusively the native interchain combination. Applying this method Met(O)(25)-RLX (RLXO) was obtained in 62% yield and was easily converted to RLX in 78% yiel…
10855706	Impairment of osteocalcin production in senescent periodontal ligament fibroblasts.	aging	2000-04-??	Osteocalcin production of senescent periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) with the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) was investigated on clones from 50-80 years old donors (n=20) with teeth extracted due to periodontitis and dental caries, and from 15-19 year old donors (n=20) with normal teeth extracted for orthodontic reasons. Immunohistochemically, the nonsenescent PDLF in all cultures in passage 2 showed strong reactivity with anti-osteocalcin. The reactive intensity of PDLF (passage 2, PD 3.0) was significantly stronger in 50-80 year old donor group than in 15-19 year old donor group, suggesting that osteocalcin production of PDLF cultured in early passage is larger in cells from adult population than in cells from adolescent population. In PDLF cultures in passage 2 from 50-80 year old donor, two types of senescent cells were found: one with strong reactivity to anti-osteocalcin and the other with little detectable reactivity. The culture cons…
16142449	To the intranucleolar translocation of AgNORs in leukemic early granulocytic and plasmacytic precursors.	aging	2006-01-??	Early leukemic granulocytic and plasmacytic precursors were studied in vitro and in vivo to provide an information on the intranucleolar distribution of AgNORs (silver stained nucleolus organizer regions). In most of these cells AgNORs appeared as clusters of silver stained particles distributed in the whole nucleolar body. On the other hand, in some leukemic early granulocytic precursors, i.e., in myeloblasts and promyelocytes enlarged AgNORs were translocated in the nucleolar peripheral part. In addition, the number of translocated AgNORs at the nucleolar periphery was significantly smaller. Such translocation of a reduced number of AgNORs was easily produced by experimental aging, i.e., starving of cultured leukemic early granulocytic precursors (HL-60 and K562 cells) in vitro and seems to be reversible. Similar translocation of a reduced number of AgNORs was also produced by aging of leukemic plasmacytic precursors. Thus, the translocation of the reduced number of AgNORs to the nuc…
30125821	Low brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in post-mortem brains of older adults with depression and dementia in a large clinicopathological sample.	aging	2018-??-01	BACKGROUND: Disturbances in peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there are no studies measuring BDNF levels directly in post-mortem brains of older subjects with MDD and dementia. We aimed to verify if brain BDNF levels were lower in older adults with lifetime history of MDD with and without dementia.    METHODS: BDNF levels of post-mortem brains from 80 community-dwelling older individuals with lifetime MDD with and without dementia were compared with levels from 80 controls without lifetime MDD. Participants with no reliable close informant, or with prolonged agonal state were excluded. Lifetime MDD was defined as at least one previous episode according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID).    RESULTS: BDNF levels were lower in the MDD group with dementia than in participants with dementia and without MDD as confirmed by multivariate analysis adjusted for clinical and cardiovascular risk fac…
20633457	Vascular responses to manual PC6 acupuncture in nonsmokers and smokers assessed by the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram waveform.	aging	2008-09-??	BACKGROUND: Smoking is reported to increase arterial stiffness. Indices obtained from the second derivative of digital volume pulse (SDDVP) waveform have been proposed to characterize vascular aging and arterial rigidity. PC6 (Neiguan) is a traditional acupoint in each forearm that has been shown to modify cardiovascular functioning.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effects of manual needling with PC6 on SDDVP indices in healthy chronic smoker and nonsmoker subjects.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Aging index (AI) was defined as (b - c - d - e)/a, B:A was calculated as the ratio of the absolute value for the height of the b wave (B) to that of the a wave (A), and D:A was calculated as the ratio of the absolute value for the height of the d wave (D) to that of the a wave (A). These indices derived of the wave components of SDDVP of healthy nonsmokers (n=40; 28.3+/-3.0 years old) vs. chronic smokers (n=30; 29.9+/-2.9 years old) were compared. The digital volume pulse (DVP) was obtained b…
20382449	Apolipoprotein E ε4-related thickening of the cerebral cortex modulates selective attention.	aging	2012-02-??	APOE ε4 carriers have thicker cortex in several neocortical areas than ε4 noncarriers (Espeseth T., Westlye L.T., Fjell A.M., Walhovd K.B., Rootwelt H., Reinvang I., 2008. Accelerated age-related cortical thinning in healthy carriers of apolipoprotein E ε4. Neurobiol. Aging 29, 329-340). To investigate potential physiological and cognitive correlates of these anatomical effects structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were obtained from 20 APOE ε3 homozygotes and 20 ε4 hetero- and homozygotes, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a selective attention task (i.e. three-stimulus oddball). Several areas in both hemispheres were thicker in ε4 carriers than in noncarriers. ε4 carriers also had lower amplitudes to distractors (P3a) and lower target detection accuracy than noncarriers. Mean thickness in cortical areas were correlated with P3a amplitudes, which in turn correlated with accuracy. Path analyses showed that APOE-related difference in accuracy was mediat…
30138832	Multiple forms of discrimination, social status, and telomere length: Interactions within race.	aging	2018-??-??	Previous research has demonstrated inverse associations between experiences of interpersonal discrimination and telomere length, a marker of cellular aging. Here, we investigate within-race interactions between multiple indices of interpersonal discrimination and sociodemographic characteristics in relation to telomere length in African American and White adults. Participants were from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (Baltimore, Maryland). Ages ranged from 30 to 64 years old and all self-identified as either African American (n = 176) or White (n = 165). Using linear regression, three patterns were observed within African Americans: (1) women reporting greater lifetime burden of discrimination (p = .02), racial (p = .03), or gender (p = .01) discrimination; (2) those with higher socioeconomic status reporting greater lifetime burden (p = .03) or racial discrimination (p = .02); and (3) younger adults reporting greater exposure to multiple sour…
12450080	Distal radius bone mineral density and grip strength in peri/postmenopausal Thai women.	aging	2002-09-??	To determine the relationship between distal radius bone mineral density (BMD) and grip strength (GS) in peri/post menopausal Thai women. 177 healthy volunteers, > or = 40 years old, were included. Distal radius BMD of the non-dominant side was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. GS of both dominant and non-dominant sides was measured using a Jamar dynamometer. The association between BMD and GS was determined by correlation analysis. Other factors possibly affecting the BMD or GS including age, years since menopause (YSM), body weight (BW), height (Ht) and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed by the multiple regression method. It was found that BMD had statistically significant but weak, positive correlation to GS (r = 0.262, p < 0.001 for the dominant side, r = 0.193, p < 0.001 for non-dominant side). Age and YSM had a negative correlation, whereas, BW and Ht had a positive correlation to either BMD or GS. After multiple regression analysis, the significant predictors of …
27502959	Licoricidin, an isoflavonoid isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisher, prevents UVA-induced photoaging of human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2017-04-??	OBJECTIVE: Licoricidin is an isoflavonoid isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisher. In this study, we investigated the effects of licoricidin on photoaging of UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs).    METHODS: In vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity, cellular protective effect and inhibition of elastase activity was determined by Fe -EDTA/H O systems, photohaemolysis and elastase activity assay, respectively. Anti-oxidative capacity of the compound was evaluated by fluorescent ELISA and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCF-DA) assay. The expression of protein and phosphorylation was examined using Western blot.    RESULTS: The ROS scavenging activity (OSC ) of licoricidin was 2.77 μM. It was 3.1-fold higher than that of L-ascorbic acid. Its protective effects were confirmed in a study of  O -induced cellular damage to human erythrocytes. The τ value of 10 μM of licoricidin was 71.0 min; this was markedly higher than that obtained with α-tocopherol (37.…
16771689	Development of the adductome approach to detect DNA damage in humans.	aging	????-??-??	The development of new strategies designed to detect DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and other means may advance our understanding of the roles of such types of damage in the etiology of cancers, in aging processes, and as biomarkers of exposure. A DNA adduct detection method that uses liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) to detect multiple DNA adducts in human lung tissue is reported herein. This adductome analysis strategy is designed to detect the neutral loss of 2 -deoxyribose from positively ionized 2 -deoxynucleoside adducts in multiple reaction ion monitoring mode (MRM) transmitting the [M + H](+) > [M + H - 116](+) transition over a total of 374 transitions in the mass range from m/z 228.8 to m/z 602.8. Data analysis is optimized and coupled with a comprehensive manual screening process designed to minimize the number of artifactual adducts appearing in the final analysis. In the final analysis, putative adduct…
17572644	Estrogen modulation of epithelial permeability in cervical-vaginal cells of premenopausal and postmenopausal women.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: To understand how menopause affects estrogen regulation of epithelial permeability.    DESIGN: Experimental study using human normal epithelial vaginal-ectocervical cells obtained from premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Endpoints were paracellular permeability (determined in terms of the resistance of the lateral intercellular space [RLIS] and tight junctions [RTJ]); cellular G-actin; nonmuscle myosin type II-B (NMMII-B) filamentation and magnesium-adenosine triphosphatase activity; and occludin expression (in terms of expression of the functional 65-kd and truncated 50-kd forms).    RESULTS: Estrogen induced an early transient decrease in RLIS that correlated in time with increases in cellular G-actin and NMMII-B magnesium-adenosine triphosphatase activity and with decreases in NMMII-B filamentation and a slower decrease in RTJ that correlated with up-regulation of the 50-kd form of occludin. Estrogen modulation of G-actin NMMII-B and occludin could be described in ter…
11352915	Protective role for c-Jun in the cellular response to DNA damage.	aging	2001-07-27	c-Jun, a member of the activation protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, has been implicated in the regulation of many important biological processes including cell cycle progression, transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Accordingly, its expression and function are upregulated in response to diverse stimuli including mitogens and a wide range of stresses. Transcriptional activation of the c-Jun protein is dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser-63 and Ser-73, a process mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Active c-Jun is required for AP-1 transactivation and c-Jun-mediated transformation, but its role during stress remains unclear as both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival effects of c-Jun have been observed. Here we investigated the importance of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation in influencing the sensitivity of human T98G glioblastoma cells to a variety of cytotoxic agents. Stable expression of a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative protein c-Jun(S63A,S73A) markedl…
30272660	Isolation of Cerebral Capillaries from Fresh Human Brain Tissue.	aging	2018-??-12	Understanding blood-brain barrier function under physiological and pathophysiological conditions is critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies that hold the promise to enhance brain drug delivery, improve brain protection, and treat brain disorders. However, studying the human blood-brain barrier function is challenging. Thus, there is a critical need for appropriate models. In this regard, brain capillaries isolated from human brain tissue represent a unique tool to study barrier function as close to the human in vivo situation as possible. Here, we describe an optimized protocol to isolate capillaries from human brain tissue at a high yield and with consistent quality and purity.

20100568	Dynamics of H2O2 availability to ARPE-19 cultures in models of oxidative stress.	aging	2010-04-15	Oxidative injury to cells such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is often modeled using H(2)O(2)-treated cultures, but H(2)O(2) concentrations are not sustained in culture medium. Here medium levels of H(2)O(2) and cytotoxicity were analyzed in ARPE-19 cultures after H(2)O(2) delivery as a single pulse or with continuous generation using glucose oxidase (GOx). When added as a pulse, H(2)O(2) is rapidly depleted (within 2 h); cytotoxicity at 24 h, determined by the MTT assay for mitochondrial function, is unaffected by medium replacement at 2 h. Continuous generation of H(2)O(2) produces complex outcomes. At low GOx concentrations, H(2)O(2) levels are sustained by conditions under which generation matches depletion, but when GOx concentrations produce cytotoxic levels of H(2)O(2), oxidant depletion accelerates. Acceleration results partly from the release of contents from oxidant-damaged cells as indicated by testing depletion after controlled membrane disruption with detergents. …
7274682	Arterial compliance, systolic pressure and heart rate in elderly women at rest and on exercise.	aging	1981-??-??	In two groups of elderly women, the relationships between arterial compliance estimated by pulse wave velocity (PWV), and systolic blood pressure (SP), heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption and the time taken to run 400 m have been studies. Both at rest and with increasing levels of exercise, faster PWVs are associated with higher SPs. These is a tendency for resting HR to be higher with faster PWVs. The changes in HR and oxygen consumption from resting values are strikingly increased with faster PWVs. The time taken over 400 m rises as arterial compliance falls. Therefore, it seems that, with aging, reduced arterial compliance is a major factor affecting cardiovascular responses to exercise.
26287932	Protective properties of ginsenoside Rb3 against UV-B radiation-induced oxidative stress in HaCaT keratinocytes.	aging	2016-??-??	This work aimed to evaluate the skin anti-photoaging properties of ginsenoside Rb3 (Rb3), one of the main protopanaxdiol-type ginsenosides from ginseng, in HaCaT keratinocytes. The skin anti-photoaging activity was assessed by analyzing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), pro-matrix metalloproteinase-2 (proMMP-2), pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9), total glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as cell viability in HaCaT keratinocytes under UV-B irradiation. When HaCaT keratinocytes were exposed to Rb3 prior to UV-B irradiation, Rb3 exhibited suppressive activities on UV-B-induced ROS, proMMP-2, and proMMP-9 enhancements. On the contrary, Rb3 displayed enhancing activities on UV-B-reduced total GSH and SOD activity levels. Rb3 could not interfere with cell viabilities in UV-B-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes. Rb3 plays a protective role against UV-B-induced oxidative stress in human HaCaT keratinocytes, proposing its potential skin anti-photoagi…
12788523	Predominant effects of Polypodium leucotomos on membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, and expression of elastin and matrixmetalloproteinase-1 in ultraviolet radiation exposed fibroblasts, and keratinocytes.	aging	2003-06-??	BACKGROUND: Polypodium leucotomos has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and photoprotective properties. Exposure of skin to ultraviolet (UV) radiation can lead to deposition of excessive elastotic material, reduction in collagen, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).    OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to determine the effects of P. leucotomos in the absence or presence of UVA or UVB radiation on membrane damage, lipid peroxidation, and expression of elastin and MMP-1 in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, respectively.    METHODS: Fibroblasts and keratinocytes, respectively, were irradiated by a single exposure to UVA (0.6, 1.8 or 3.6 J) or UVB radiation (0.75, 2.5 or 7.5 mJ), and then incubated with, or without, P. leucotomos (0.01, 0.1 and 1%) and examined for membrane damage, lipid peroxidation, expression of elastin (protein levels) and MMP-1 (protein levels or MMP-1 promoter activity).    RESULTS: UV radiation did not significantly al…
20171286	White matter structures associated with creativity: evidence from diffusion tensor imaging.	aging	2010-05-15	Creativity has been essential to the development of human civilization and plays a crucial role in cultural life. However, despite literature that has proposed the importance of structural connectivity in the brain for creativity, the relationship between regional white matter integrity and creativity has never been directly investigated. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging and a behavioral creativity test of divergent thinking to investigate the relationship between creativity and structural connectivity. We examined associations between creativity and fractional anisotropy across the brain in healthy young adult (mean age, 21.7 years old; [SD]=1.44) men (n=42) and women (n=13). After controlling for age, sex, and score on Raven's advanced progressive matrices, a test for psychometric measures of intelligence, significant positive relationships between fractional anisotropy and individual creativity as measured by the divergent thinking test were observed in the white matt…
18423648	Changes in segmental inertial properties with age.	aging	2008-??-??	The purpose of this study was to examine how the limb segment inertial parameters vary across the decades from the 1920s to the 1970s. Sixty-six males participated in this study, ranging in age from 20 to 79 years. Pre-screening ensured that all subjects were healthy. The inertial properties of the segments were determined by modeling each segment as series of geometric solids. A multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed statistically significant differences between decade age groups for the upper arm, forearm, shank, and thigh (p<0.01). Subsequent ANOVAs revealed statistically significant differences for all the inertial properties for the upper arm, the center of mass location for the forearm, and segment mass for the thigh. Linear regression lines were fit to the data so that each inertial parameter for each segment could be predicted by subject's age, with the slope of this regression line indicating the trend in the data. These trends were statistically significant for al…
22894906	An insight into the various regulatory mechanisms modulating human DNA methyltransferase 1 stability and function.	aging	2012-09-??	DNA methylation is one of the principal epigenetic signals that participate in cell specific gene expression in vertebrates. DNA methylation plays a quintessential role in the control of gene expression, cellular differentiation and development. It also plays a central role in the preservation of chromatin structure and chromosomal integrity, parental imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, aging and carcinogenesis. The foremost contributor in the mammalian methylation scheme is DNMT1, a maintenance methyltransferase that faithfully copies the pre-existing methyl marks onto hemimethylated daughter strands during DNA replication to maintain the established methylation patterns across successive cell divisions. The ever-changing cellular physiology and the significant part that DNA methylation plays in genome regulation necessitate rigid management of this enzyme. In mammalian cells, a host of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms regulate the expression, activity and stability of DNMT1. Tra…
18328270	Evidence for a physiological role of intracellularly occurring photolabile nitrogen oxides in human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2008-05-01	Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in human skin biology. Cutaneous NO can be produced enzymatically by NO synthases (NOS) as well as enzyme independently via photodecomposition of photolabile nitrogen oxides (PNOs) such as nitrite or nitroso compounds, both found in human skin tissue in comparably high concentrations. Although the physiological role of NOS-produced NO in human skin is well defined, nothing is known about the biological relevance or the chemical origin of intracellularly occurring PNOs. We here, for the first time, give evidence that in human skin fibroblasts (FB) PNOs represent the oxidation products of NOS-produced NO and that in human skin fibroblasts intracellularly occurring PNOs effectively protect against the injurious effects of UVA radiation by a NO-dependent mechanism. In contrast, in PNO-depleted FB cultures an increased susceptibility to UVA-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death is observed, whereas supplementation of PNO-depleted FB cultures with p…
28685446	PFC Blood Oxygenation Changes in Four Different Cognitive Tasks.	aging	2017-??-??	Aging often results in a decline in cognitive function, related to alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. Maintenance of this function in an aging society is an important issue. Some practices/drills, moderate exercise, mastication, and a cognitive task itself could enhance cognitive function. In this validation study, before evaluating the effects of some drills on the elderly, we examined the neural substrate of blood oxygenation changes by the use of four cognitive tasks and fNIRS. Seven healthy volunteers (mean age 25.3 years) participated in this study. Each task session was designed in a block manner; 4 periods of rests (30 s) and 3 blocks of four tasks (30 s). The tasks used were: a computerized Stroop test, a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a Sternberg working memory paradigm, and a semantic verbal fluency task. The findings of the study are that all four tasks activated PFC to some extent, without laterality except for the verbal fluency task. The results confirm …
26988516	Variations in oxygen and ellagitannins, and organoleptic properties of red wine aged in French oak barrels classified by a near infrared system.	aging	2016-08-01	During wine aging in barrels, antioxidant molecules from wood, such as ellagitannins, are solubilized and react with wine molecules and oxygen. However, their concentrations are highly variable. Oxygen is an important factor, as it plays a role in wine parameters and organoleptic perceptions. Five barrel modalities were used; three polyphenol indices (IP), classified using the NIRS procedure, and three grain qualities. Barrels were equipped with windows to measure the oxygen using luminescence technology. The ellagitannin concentrations in the wine and its organoleptic properties were monitored. Oxygen concentrations decreased quickly during the first 8days of aging and this phenomenon was significantly more marked in barrels with a higher IP and medium grain. The ellagitannin concentrations were believed to be correlated with wood classification and oxygen consumption. Furthermore, the organoleptic properties were significantly impacted, as the wine with the lowest ellagitannin level …
15772901	Reduced phosphorylation of transcription factor Elk-1 in cultured fibroblasts of a patient with premature aging syndrome and insulin resistance.	aging	2005-02-??	The effect of insulin and growth factor mediated signaling to gene regulation was investigated in cultured fibroblasts of a patient with a premature aging syndrome (metageria) and severe insulin resistance. Insulin receptor structure and function as well as major pathways activated by insulin, i.e. phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI-3 K) cascade or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, were functional. Inducibility of the proto-oncogene cfos, a representative endpoint of signaling pathways related to gene expression, by growth factors or insulin was reduced in patient cells. This reduced induction persisted in cfos promoter reporter gene studies indicating that the post receptor defect is localized proximal to the cfos promoter itself. Abundances of the transcription factors Elk-1 and SRF being major players in coupling of MAPKs to cfos promoter activation were not altered. However, basal and inducible phosphorylation of Elk-1 was impaired. In addition, basal and stimulated…
17225865	Sp1 is essential for p16 expression in human diploid fibroblasts during senescence.	aging	2007-01-17	BACKGROUND: p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor protein has been widely proposed to mediate entrance of the cells into the senescent stage. Promoter of p16(INK4a) gene contains at least five putative GC boxes, named GC-I to V, respectively. Our previous data showed that a potential Sp1 binding site, within the promoter region from -466 to -451, acts as a positive transcription regulatory element. These results led us to examine how Sp1 and/or Sp3 act on these GC boxes during aging in cultured human diploid fibroblasts.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mutagenesis studies revealed that GC-I, II and IV, especially GC-II, are essential for p16(INK4a) gene expression in senescent cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and ChIP assays demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to these elements and the binding activity is enhanced in senescent cells. Ectopic overexpression of Sp1, but not Sp3, induced the transcription of p16(INK4a). Both Sp1 RNAi and Mithramycin, a DNA intercalating ag…
29975755	Acceptance of different design exergames in elders.	aging	2018-??-??	For promoting the successful aging of elderly residents of Chang Gung Silver Village in Taiwan, five interactive exergames were developed to promote the well-being of the elderly. The exergames included both physical games and cognitive games, and were implemented using various computer-based technologies in the Chang Gung Silver Village. The exergames were trialed by 39 elderly residents (15 male, 24 female; mean age 79.5 ± 17.5 years) of Chang Gung Silver Village. Following the trials, the participants were requested to complete a Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness of the exergames were significantly related to the users' usage behavior and intention to use for both the physical games and the cognitive games. However, a relationship between the output quality of the game and the usage behavior was apparent only in the case of the cognitive exergames. Finally, the impact of social influence on …
24914573	Resveratrol in vitro ameliorates tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced alterations in erythrocyte membranes from young and older humans.	aging	2014-10-??	Implication of reactive oxygen species/oxidative stress has been readily reported in etiology of aging and related manifestations. Plasma membrane as a regulator of numerous aspects of cell physiology including cell-cell interaction, solute transport, and signal transduction, provides structural integrity to the cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of resveratrol administration in vitro, to evaluate the biological effect of this phytoalexin in oxidatively injured erythrocytes during aging. This study, carried out on 91 normal healthy subjects, provides experimental evidence that erythrocytes have increased oxidative damage with age. In vitro administration of resveratrol significantly attenuated deleterious effects of oxidative injury in erythrocytes from humans of all ages.
16776615	A simulated couple aging across the four years of medical school.	aging	2006-??-??	BACKGROUND: The medical students of today will deliver health care to an ever-increasing aging population. Regardless of specialties, physicians must view older patients holistically with attention to medical, psychosocial, and family issues and functional status.

The woman represents the healthy aging process, whereas the man represents an elder experiencing multiple health problems. Through standardized patient experiences, small-group encounters, and paper-based learning modules, students address typical age-related issues that provide experiences representative of aging in today's society.    EVALUATION: Sessions were rated good to excellent. Comments were positive, especially regarding interactions with the aging couple.    CONCLUSIONS: Aging Couple Across the Curriculum allowed the interweaving of multiple issues that are characteristic of many geriatric cases. Stu…
22898719	Psychological well-being of the institutionalized and community-residing oldest old in China: the role of children.	longevity, aging	2012-11-??	Studies have shown that institutionalized older adults have worse psychological health than their community-residing counterparts. However, much less is known about this association in developing countries such as China with a rapidly aging population and a short history of institutional care. This article investigates the role of children in differences in psychological well-being between institutionalized and community-residing oldest-old adults in China. Using national data from the 1998, 2000, and 2002 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, results show that the institutionalized have significantly better psychological health-measured by positive affect, loneliness, and quality of life-than those living in the community. Furthermore, we find that the associations are moderated by child-related factors (number of children, proximity, and visits) and strengthened for the three measures of psychological well-being after adjustments for socioeconomic factors, socia…

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Many individuals in an aging society experience oral dryness. Maintaining the flow of saliva and the presence of antimicrobial substances is important to maintain oral health. The inhibition of the secretion of antimicrobial substances could lead to oral dryness.    PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial substances lactoferrin and chromogranin A in the saliva of elderly individuals with oral dryness.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 25 controls and 28 participants with subjective oral dryness. The levels of lactoferrin and chromogranin A were determined in unstimulated whole saliva with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The differences in secretion of lactoferrin and chromogranin A between the controls and the participants with oral dryness were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test (α=.05).

17556535	The retinol acid receptor B gene is hypermethylated in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy.	aging	2007-06-??	Mutations in the LMNA gene cause various phenotypes including partial lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophies, and progeroid syndromes. The specific mutation position within the LMNA sequence can partially predict the phenotype, but the underlying mechanisms for the development of these different phenotypes are still unclear. To investigate whether different DNA methylation patterns contribute to the development of different phenotypes caused by LMNA mutations, we analyzed a panel of ten candidate genes related to fat metabolism, aging, and a tendency to different methylation patterns: CSPG2, ESR1, IGF1R, IGFR2, LMNA, MLH1, RANBP1, RARB, ZMPSTE24, and TGFBR1. We studied two independent families each comprising three individuals affected by familial partial lipodistrophy type 2 (FPLD2). Affected members in each family carried two different mutations of the LMNA gene (R482L and R471G respectively). In addition, we analyzed four progeria patients (2xLMNA/C G608G, 1xLMNA/C S143F, and 1xZMPSTE2…
16956698	Cocaine-induced oxidative stress precedes cell death in human neuronal progenitor cells.	aging	2007-01-??	By 2003, an estimated 34 million Americans had used cocaine according to the National Survey on Drug Use & Health. About 5.9 million of those had used in the past 12 months. Chronic cocaine users often develop addiction, dependency and tolerance to the drug. The psychological and physical effects of cocaine are due to the disruption of the limbic system in the central nervous system (CNS). Increased oxidative stress reported in the frontal cortex and the striatum of rats exposed to cocaine suggests that oxidative damage plays a significant role in cocaine-induced disruption of the CNS. Although it is evident that cocaine induces oxidative stress in the CNS, little has been learned about whether such increased oxidative stress is also relevant to apoptosis in cocaine-exposed models. To gain insight into the role of cocaine-induced oxidative stress in apoptosis, we hypothesized that oxidative stress precedes cell death when cocaine is administrated. To test this hypothesis, we have monit…
24707889	Spontaneously formed robust steroidal vesicles: physicochemical characterization and interaction with HSA.	aging	2014-05-01	Self-assembled multimolecular aggregates, such as vesicles, have earned tremendous attention for their applications as model membranes and drug delivery systems. Over the past decades, enormous efforts have been dedicated to the development of stable and biocompatible vesicles that form spontaneously in aqueous solution. With the aim of preparing highly stable vesicles, we herein report the physicochemical characterization of a novel cholesterol-based chiral surfactant with l-alanine headgroup. Different techniques, such as surface tensiometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal fluorescence microscopy were employed to investigate the self-assembly properties of the aforementioned single-tailed steroidal surfactant in aqueous solution. The surfactant molecule is weakly surface-active, but self-assembles to form unilamellar vesicles facilitated by the strong hydrophobic association of the cholesterol m…
18658245	WRN Exonuclease activity is blocked by specific oxidatively induced base lesions positioned in either DNA strand.	aging	2008-09-??	Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in the WS gene (WRN). Although WRN has been suggested to play an important role in DNA metabolic pathways, such as recombination, replication and repair, its precise role still remains to be determined. WRN possesses ATPase, helicase and exonuclease activities. Previous studies have shown that the WRN exonuclease is inhibited in vitro by certain lesions induced by oxidative stress and positioned in the digested strand of the substrate. The presence of the 70/86 Ku heterodimer (Ku), participating in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), alleviates WRN exonuclease blockage imposed by the oxidatively induced DNA lesions. The current study demonstrates that WRN exonuclease is inhibited by several additional oxidized bases, and that Ku stimulates the WRN exonuclease to bypass these lesions. Specific lesions present in the non-digested strand were shown also to inhibit the progression of the WRN exonuclease; however,…
15699527	Age-related femoral bone loss in men: evidence for hyperparathyroidism and insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency.	aging	2004-12-??	BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the extent to which the age-related decline of femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD) might be explained by the age-related change of body composition and biological parameters and the mechanisms by which these factors might influence FN BMD in men.    METHODS: The relationships between FN BMD and anthropometric, hormonal, and biochemical parameters and bone turnover markers were studied in 82 men aged 25-86 years.    RESULTS: Age was associated with a decline of FN BMD and osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), and urinary C-telopeptide (p <.05). The significant relationship between FN BMD and OC (p <.01) did not remain after adjustment for age. With use of multiple linear regression and adjusting for all significant variables associated with FN BMD in univariate analysis (p <.01) (age, weight, lean and fat mass, height, and levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, insulin-like growth factor [IGF-1], testosterone, and parathyroid …
15503339	Age-related differences in serum gonadotropin (FSH and LH), salivary testosterone, and 17-beta estradiol levels among Ache Amerindian males of Paraguay.	aging	2005-05-??	Age-related differences in serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), salivary testosterone, and 17-beta estradiol levels are reported for Ache Amerindian males (n = 17; mean age, 37.1 +/- 14.2 SD) of Paraguay in order to explore population variation in patterns of male reproductive senescence in a foraging/agricultural community. Hormone associations were examined to test various hypotheses for age-related differences in hypothalamic-pituitary function. Significant increases in FSH (r = 0.75, P < 0.0005) and LH (r = 0.65, P < 0.01) were noted in association with aging. No significant correlation was observed between morning or evening testosterone and age. Morning and evening estradiol levels were associated with morning and evening testosterone, respectively (morning, r = 0.53, P = 0.05; evening, r = 0.63, P = 0.02). Evening estradiol was also positively associated with LH (r = 0.66, P = 0.02), suggesting testicular production to be an important source of cir…
7836113	Strength training increases insulin action in healthy 50- to 65-yr-old men.	aging	1994-09-??	The insulin resistance associated with aging may be due, in part, to reduced levels of physical activity in the elderly. We hypothesized that strength training increases insulin action in older individuals. To test this hypothesis, 11 healthy men 50-63 yr old [mean 58 +/- 1 (SE) yr] underwent a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp with concurrent indirect calorimetry and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after 16 wk of strength training. The training program increased overall strength by 47% (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM; measured by hydrodensitometry) increased (62.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 63.6 +/- 2.1 kg; P < 0.05) and body fat decreased (27.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 25.6 +/- 1.9%; P < 0.001) with training. Fasting plasma glucose levels and glucose levels during the OGTT were not significantly lower after training. In contrast, fasting plasma insulin levels decreased (85 +/- 25 vs. 55 +/- 10 pmol/l; P < 0.05) and insulin levels decreased (P < 0.05, analysis of variance) durin…
19342124	Memory activation in healthy nonagenarians.	aging	2011-03-??	Little is known about brain function in the oldest old, although this is the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries and is of paramount importance in public health considerations. In this study, we investigated the cerebral response to a memory task in healthy subjects over age 90 compared with healthy younger elderly. We studied 29 healthy elderly subjects, 12 over age 90 and 17 between age 70 and 80. All subjects were cognitively intact, as verified by a neuropsychological battery, and performed a nonverbal memory task while undergoing a functional MRI (fMRI). Activation results were analyzed by a random-effects ANCOVA using SPM5. The task resulted in activation of similar areas of the posterior temporal, parietal, and posterior frontal cortexes, but the activation was more robust in the younger subjects, especially in the right hippocampus, and parietal and temporal cortices. This finding remained after controlling for education, cognition, task performance…
21707464	A brief questionnaire on metacognition: psychometric properties.	aging	2011-11-??	OBJECTIVES: Existing questionnaires on personal views of one's own cognitive functioning are either unduly long, restrict their focus on memory, and/or capture complaints rather than the general status quo. A brief 9-item questionnaire was developed, assessing metacognition with two subscales covering metamemory and metaconcentration.    METHODS: The questionnaire was tested in a sample of healthy women (n = 228) aged 70-93 years, during two face-to-face interviews with an interval of 6 months.    RESULTS: Subscales were confirmed to have factorial validity. While objective cognitive test performance did not predict self-reported everyday functioning, metamemory and metaconcentration accounted for a substantial amount of its variance. The newly developed instrument was shown to be predominantly characterized by latent trait variance components.    CONCLUSION: The presented questionnaire is advantageous for the assessment of metacognition as it is brief and easily applicable. Since meta…

The present study was conducted to determine the association between drusen and ASHS-LIA and to provide further evidence for our hypothesis.    Methods: Patients who underwent indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2014 to March 2018 were reviewed. Patients with soft drusen or ASHS-LIA in the fellow eyes were included in this study.    Results: A total of 345 patients aged 33 to 87 years (mean: 66.1 ± 8.4 years) were included in this study. Results showed that all patients had ASHS-LIA, among them, 70 patients (20.3%) had concurrent soft drusen, while 156 patients (45.2%) had concurrent hard drusen. Furthermore, the incidence of soft drusen was 8.9% (10/112), 21.2% (41/193), and …
22708121	Juglans mandshurica leaf extract protects skin fibroblasts from damage by regulating the oxidative defense system.	aging	2012-05-04	Skin is mainly damaged by genetic and environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, xenobiotics, hormonal changes, heat, and smoking. ROS production is commonly involved in the pathogenesis of skin damage induced by these factors, causing skin aging, including wrinkling, by activating the metalloproteinases (MMP-1) that break down type I collagen (COL1A1). The walnut tree Juglans mandshurica MAX. (JM) is found in China, Siberia and Korea. JM has been reported to have various pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidative, and anti-bacterial effects. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of JM leaf extract (JME) against oxidative stress in HS68 human skin fibroblasts. JME significantly and dose-dependently protected HS68 cells against H₂O₂-induced damage, as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assay. Other assays demonstrated that JME protected HS68 cells by regulating ROS production …
20194112	Spatial, temporal and interindividual epigenetic variation of functionally important DNA methylation patterns.	aging	2010-07-??	DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene regulation. It can be influenced by stochastic events, environmental factors and developmental programs. However, little is known about the natural variation of gene-specific methylation patterns. In this study, we performed quantitative methylation analyses of six differentially methylated imprinted genes (H19, MEG3, LIT1, NESP55, PEG3 and SNRPN), one hypermethylated pluripotency gene (OCT4) and one hypomethylated tumor suppressor gene (APC) in chorionic villus, fetal and adult cortex, and adult blood samples. Both average methylation level and range of methylation variation depended on the gene locus, tissue type and/or developmental stage. We found considerable variability of functionally important methylation patterns among unrelated healthy individuals and a trend toward more similar methylation levels in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. Imprinted genes showed relatively little methylation…
10331888	Exercise cardiac function in young through elderly endurance trained women.	aging	1999-05-??	PURPOSE: To clarify the physiological reasons for the decline in aerobic power of endurance trained (ET) women with aging.    METHODS: Blood volume, VO2max, and exercise cardiac function were examined in 23 ET women; six age 20-29 yr, six age 40-45 yr, six age 49-54 yr, and five age 58-63 yr.    RESULTS: Blood volume was unchanged with aging. VO2max declined progressively at a rate of 0.51 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) x yr(-1). During maximal exercise, there was an increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and a decrease in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output with increasing age. At all ages, cardiac filling (diastole) was significantly faster than cardiac emptying (systole). Stroke volume did not plateau at a submaximal work rate but increased progressively to maximum.    CONCLUSIONS: The decline in VO2max with age in ET women is due to decreases in maximal heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output, and the primary advantage in the exercise cardiac performance of ET women of…
7740249	Exercise, training and red blood cell turnover.	lifespan, aging	1995-01-??	Endurance training can lead to what has been termed 'sports anaemia'. Although under normal conditions, red blood cells (RBCs) have a lifespan of about 120 days, the rate of aging may increase during intensive training. However, RBC deficiency is rare in athletes, and sports anaemia is probably due to an expanded plasma volume. Cycling, running and swimming have been shown to cause RBC damage. While most investigators measure indices of haemolysis (for example, plasma haemoglobin or haptoglobin), RBC removal is normally an extravascular process that does not involve haemolysis. Attention is now turning to cellular indices (such as antioxidant depletion, or protein or lipid damage) that may be more indicative of exercise-induced damage. RBCs are vulnerable to oxidative damage because of their continuous exposure to oxygen and their high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and haem iron. As oxidative stress may be proportional to oxygen uptake, it is not surprising that antioxi…
28672163	Evaluation of whole cigarette smoke induced oxidative stress in A549 and BEAS-2B cells.	aging	2017-09-??	Cigarette smoke is a complex and oxidative aerosol. Previous researches on the hazards of cigarette smoke mainly focused on the adverse bioeffects induced by its condensates or gas vapor phase, which ignored the dynamic processes of smoking and the cigarette smoke aging. To overcome these disadvantages, we performed air-liquid interface exposure of whole smoke, which used native and unmodified smoke and ensured the exposure similar to physiological inhalation. Our results indicated that whole cigarette smoke induced lung epithelial cells (A549) and bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) damages in cytotoxicity assays (methyl thiazoly tetrazolium and neutral red uptake assays). In addition, A549 and BEAS-2B cells showed oxidative damages in whole smoke exposure, with concentration change of several biomarkers (reduced and oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxyhydroxy-2-nonenal, extracellular superoxide dismutase, and 8-hydroxyl deoxyguanosine). These results indicate that whole …
3643024	Effect of elastin peptides on human monocytes: Ca2+ mobilization, stimulation of respiratory burst and enzyme secretion.	aging	1986-11-26	The effect of elastin peptides (Kappa-elastin) was investigated on human monocytes. The data presented here indicate that elastin peptides increase the intracellular Ca2+ level measured by Quin 2 fluorescence and mediate the release of beta glucuronidase and elastase. The O2 consumption and H2O2 release were stimulated in a dose-dependent manner. The early rise of cAMP was followed by a return to the original level at 30 min and by a concomitant increase of cGMP level. The action of elastin peptides on intracellular calcium level and cGMP levels may well be related to its previously demonstrated chemotactic activity. These activities may well play a role in the modifications of the extracellular matrix following elastin degradation as observed in atherosclerosis, emphysema and aging.
29634767	Frailty in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of middle-aged Americans in Baltimore.	aging	2018-??-??	Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35-64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45-54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55-64 …
20100570	Examination of the expanding pathways for the regulation of p21 expression and activity.	aging	2010-07-??	p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) was originally identified as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, a mediator of p53 in growth suppression and a marker of cellular senescence. p21 is required for proper cell cycle progression and plays a role in cell death, DNA repair, senescence and aging, and induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming. Although transcriptional regulation is considered to be the initial control point for p21 expression, there is growing evidence that post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations play a critical role in p21 expression and activity. This review will briefly discuss the activity of p21 and focus on current knowledge of the determinants that control p21 transcription, mRNA stability and translation, and protein stability and activity.
22579401	Gender differences in widowhood effects among community-dwelling elders by causes of death in Taiwan.	aging	2012-07-??	PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether widowhood-associated excess mortality differs by gender in terms of causes of death.    METHODS: Data were collected from a five-wave interview of approximately 2500 community-dwelling elders in the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Nearly Elderly and Elderly. Baseline characteristics were used to derive the risk score (RS) to reflect individual's baseline pre-widowhood vulnerability. Time-dependent Cox regression analyses were used to estimate spousal loss-related mortality by causes.    RESULTS: For males, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of widowhood for all-cause and some major causes of death (e.g., neoplasm) increased inversely with RS: the aHRs for all-cause death were 4.81 and 1.76 in the lowest and highest RS groups, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding aHRs were relatively homogeneous for women (1.52 and 1.70).    CONCLUSIONS: Identifying gender heterogeneity in widowhood effects can guide further efforts to devise gend…
23296664	Measuring reactive oxygen species in senescent cells.	lifespan	2013-??-??	Countless studies have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction in the ageing process. During cellular senescence, the ultimate and irreversible loss of replicative capacity of somatic cells grown in culture, several studies have reported increased levels of ROS associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic inefficiency. Moreover, studies have revealed that interventions modulating intracellular ROS can impact on the replicative lifespan of cultured cells, suggesting that ROS play a central role in the process. In this chapter, we present several protocols used for detection of (intra- and extracellular) ROS in live cells.
7204542	Studies on the origin of androstanediol and androstanediol glucuronide in young and elderly men.	aging	1981-04-??	The in vivo origin of androstanediol (3 alpha diol) and its glucuronide was studied in six young and five elderly men undergoing cardiac catheterization. Constant infusions of [14C]testosterone and [3H]3 alpha diol were given, and blood was obtained from the aorta and hepatic vein in order to measure metabolic clearance, splanchnic extraction, and the possibility of splanchnic production of both 3 alpha diol and its glucuronide. In young elderly men, the concentrations of labeled and unlabeled testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and 3 alpha diol were lower in the hepatic vein than in the aorta. The specific activities of dihydrotestosterone and 3 alpha diol were the same in blood entering and leaving the splanchnic compartment. The plasma concentration of 3 alpha diol was 18 +/- 2 in the young men and 15 +/- 4 ng/dl in the elderly group. However, the blood production rate of 3 alpha diol determined from the metabolic clearance and morning plasma concentration was reduced (324 vs. 199 mi…
10074358	Exploring the active center of human acetylcholinesterase with stereomers of an organophosphorus inhibitor with two chiral centers.	aging	1999-03-09	The stereoselectivity of the phosphonylation reaction and the effects of adduct configuration on the aging process were examined for human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) and its selected active center mutants, using the four stereomers of 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman). The reactivity of wild type HuAChE toward the PS-soman diastereomers was 4.0-7.5 x 10(4)-fold higher than that toward the PR-diastereomers. Aging of the PSCS-somanyl-HuAChE conjugate was also >1.6 x 10(4)-fold faster than that of the corresponding PRCS-somanyl adduct, as shown by both reactivation and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) experiments. On the other hand, both processes exhibited very limited sensitivity to the chirality of the alkoxy group Calpha of either PS- or PR-diastereomers. These stereoselectivities presumably reflect the relative participation of the enzyme in stabilization of the Michaelis complexes and in dealkylation of the respective covalent conjugates, and therefor…
10639670	Changes in brain water diffusion during childhood.	aging	1999-12-??	We studied the changes in brain water diffusion in childhood as seen on diffusion-weighted MRI in 30 children from 1 day of life to 17 years to provide a data base and to investigate the correlation of diffusion changes with known patterns of white matter maturation. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and apparent anisotropy (AA) were calculated in numerous regions of the brain to include major white matter tracts and gray matter. ADC and AA values were directly related to the structural maturity and compactness of the white matter tracts and changed with aging in a way that predated early myelination markers such as signal change on T1- or T2-weighted images. Diffusion of water is sensitive to structural changes in the brain such as white matter maturation and may be useful in investigating white matter disorders.
20352024	Identification of crystallin modifications in the human lens cortex and nucleus using laser capture microdissection and CyDye labeling.	aging	2010-03-23	PURPOSE: With aging, lens crystallins undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) and these modifications are believed to play a major role in age-related cataract development. The purpose of the present study was to determine the protein profiles of crystallins and their PTMs in the cortical and nuclear regions within an aging human lens to gain a better understanding about changes in crystallins as fiber cells migrate from cortical to nuclear region.    METHODS: Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to select and capture cells from cortical and nuclear regions of 12 mum, optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound-embedded frozen lens sections from a 69-year-old human lens. Proteins were extracted and then analyzed by 2-D difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) with sulfonated indocyanine dye (CyDye) labeling. Crystallin identities and their PTMs were then determined by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) and Electrospray Ionization Quad…
30180808	Psychological distress in elderly people is associated with diet, wellbeing, health status, social support and physical functioning- a HUNT3 study.	aging	2018-??-04	BACKGROUND: The increasing proportion of people growing old, demands expanded knowledge of how people can experience successful aging. Having a good life while growing old is dependent on several factors such as nutrition, physical health, the ability to perform activities of daily living, lifestyle and psychological health. Furthermore, unhealthy food intake is found to be a modifiable risk factor for depression in elderly people. To promote elderly's health and wellbeing, the influence of nutrition, lifestyle, physical functioning, and social support on psychological distress needs exploring. Therefore, the purpose of this present study is to investigate the associations between psychological distress and diet patterns when adjusting for other life style behaviors, wellbeing, health status, physical functioning and social support in elderly people.    METHODS: The present study is cross sectional, using data from wave three of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (2006-2008). Data include…
14705894	Relationship between potentiometric measurements, sensorial analysis, and some substances responsible for aroma degradation of white wines.	aging	2003-07-30	Oxidative degradation of white wines can be described sensorially as developing from a loss at positive aroma characteristics, through the development of negative aromas to a linel stage of chromatic alterations. This work attempts to relate the oxidation "status" evaluate by potentiometric titrations, with sensorial degradation and the levels of substances responsible for "off-flavors", such as methional and phenylacetaldehyde. The potentiometric titration employed measures the most powerful antioxidants of white wines (e.g., those which more rapidly consume oxygen). Considering that aromatic precedes chromatic degradation, resistance to oxidation (ROX) constitutes a useful indicator of resistance to oxidation. Sensorial degradation (ID), potentiometric measures, and volatiles were determined both in samples submitted to a "forced aging" protocol and normal aged white wines. High correlation values were observed between ROX and the ID, in both sets (r > 0.87). ID is better explained b…
21770952	Immunological detection of N-formylkynurenine in porphyrin-mediated photooxided lens α-crystallin.	aging	????-??-??	Crystallin proteins are responsible for maintaining lens transparency and allowing the lens to focus light undistorted onto the retina. The α-crystallins are the major lens crystallins, and function as both structural proteins and chaperones to protect all lens proteins from damage leading to lens deterioration. Because lens crystallin proteins do not turn over, the damage they accumulate can lead to cataracts, the world's leading cause of blindness. Photosensitizing porphyrins can accumulate in the eye through either endogenous metabolism or through therapeutic or diagnostic procedures. Porphyrin buildup exacerbates lens aging through increased levels of singlet oxygen, resulting in protein polymerization and amino acid residue alteration. Tryptophans oxidize to kynurenine and N-formylkynurenine (NFK) causing irreversible changes in the refractive index of the normally transparent lens, leading to development of cataracts. Additionally, NFK is itself a photosensitizer, and its presenc…
18365017	p16(INK4a) translation suppressed by miR-24.	aging	2008-03-26	BACKGROUND: Expression of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) increases during aging and replicative senescence.    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the microRNA miR-24 suppresses p16 expression in human diploid fibroblasts and cervical carcinoma cells. Increased p16 expression with replicative senescence was associated with decreased levels of miR-24, a microRNA that was predicted to associate with the p16 mRNA coding and 3'-untranslated regions. Ectopic miR-24 overexpression reduced p16 protein but not p16 mRNA levels. Conversely, introduction of antisense (AS)-miR-24 blocked miR-24 expression and markedly enhanced p16 protein levels, p16 translation, and the production of EGFP-p16 reporter bearing the miR-24 target recognition sites.    CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our results suggest that miR-24 represses the initiation and elongation phases of p16 translation.
29195968	Sensory characterization of the astringency of commercial Uruguayan Tannat wines.	aging	2017-??-??	Astringency is one of the most important characteristics that define the quality of red wine, and is of particular relevance for Tannat, Uruguayan emblematic red wine variety. Astringency is a time-dependant and complex sensory characteristic, related to several sensations, or sub-qualities, that can be simultaneously perceived. The aim of the present study was to obtain a sensory characterization of the astringency of commercial Uruguayan Tannat wines. Forty samples with different characteristics in terms of vintage, price segment and aging in oak barrels were assessed by a panel of 9 trained assessors. Total astringency intensity was evaluated using time-intensity (TI), while astringency sub-qualities were described using a check-all-that-apply (CATA) question composed of sixteen terms. TI and the CATA question provided different information on the astringency of Tannat wines. Regarding global astringency, samples mainly differed in intensity-related parameters rather than in the dev…
18386621	Is IGF-1 involved in the regulatory modifications of cholesterolemia following the administration of embryonary peptides?	aging	2006-??-??	Significant modifications of IGF-1 and cholesterol (total and LDL) were observed following the administration of an extract of embryonary peptides (EP) to old subjects for 60 days. For most of the subjects, due to the aging process, the initial values of the biochemical parameters were shifted towards pathological range. Following the administration of EP, the serum levels of IGF-1 and cholesterol (total and LDL) were shifted towards the physiological limits for their age. The most significant modifications towards physiological range were observed for subjects with high, initial levels of IGF-1, when the decrease was striking (1-2 orders of magnitude). For these subjects, significant modifications were observed simultaneously for cholesterol. The modifications induced following the administration of EP exhibit a regulatory feature, as they are dependent on the initial levels of these parameters. The action of EP on the levels of IGF-1 and cholesterol was significantly equal for both s…
26976686	3-O-Laurylglyceryl ascorbate activates the intracellular antioxidant system through the contribution of PPAR-γ and Nrf2.	aging	2016-06-??	BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid (AsA) has multifunctional effects on physiology and aging including the prevention and improvement of skin pigmentation and wrinkles. AsA has scavenging effects against various types of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are initiators of aging and premature aging of the skin. However, AsA not only has a quite unstable characteristic, but also has low skin penetration. In addition, existing water-soluble AsA derivatives are not effective to improve its penetration of the skin.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antioxidant effect of a newly synthesized amphipathic derivative of AsA, 3-O-laurylglyceryl ascorbate (VC-3LG), in which a laurylglyceryl group was introduced into AsA.    METHODS: Intracellular ROS levels in keratinocytes were evaluated using the 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) assay. Real-time PCR was used to investigate the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of VC-3LG.    RESULTS: Although VC-3LG had less ability to scavenge ROS compare…
23123187	Gender differences in anthropometric predictors of physical performance in older adults.	aging	2012-12-??	BACKGROUND: Both high body fat and low muscle mass have been associated with physical disability in older adults. However, men and women differ markedly in body composition; men generally have more absolute and relative lean muscle mass and less fat mass than women. It is not known how these anthropometric differences differentially affect physical ability in men and women.    OBJECTIVES: This study examines differences in anthropometric predictors of physical performance in older women and men.    METHODS: Participants were 470 older women and men 72.9 (7.9) years of age. Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Maximum leg strength and power were measured using a leg press. Muscle quality (MQ) was calculated as relative strength (leg press strength per kilogram of leg muscle mass). Gait speed and chair rise were used to assess mobility performance and functional strength.    RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI), age, and MQ emerged as predictors (P < 0.05) of f…
12670948	Human CLK2 links cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and telomere length regulation.	aging	2003-06-13	Mutations in the clk-2 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans affect organismal features such as development, behavior, reproduction, and aging as well as cellular features such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, the DNA replication checkpoint, and telomere length. clk-2 encodes a novel protein (CLK-2) with a unique homologue in each of the sequenced eukaryotic genomes. We have studied the human homologue of CLK-2 (hCLK2) to determine whether it affects the same set of cellular features as CLK-2. We find that overexpression of hCLK2 decreases cell cycle length and that inhibition of hCLK2 expression arrests the cell cycle reversibly. Overexpression of hCLK2, however, renders the cell hypersensitive to apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress or DNA replication block and gradually increases telomere length. The evolutionary conservation of the pattern of cellular functions affected by CLK-2 suggests that the function of hCLK2 in humans might also affect the same organismal features as in…
16648648	Endurance exercise and leg strength in older women.	aging	2006-01-??	Quadriceps strength and mass peak in the third decade of life, plateau, and then decline from the fifth decade on. To examine the influence of chronic endurance training and age on lean mass and leg strength, women runners (n = 62, age 43-69 years) and sedentary participants (n = 33, age 43-66 years) were divided into 40-, 50-, and 60-year age groups. Absolute isokinetic concentric torque did not differ between runners and sedentary women (97.9 +/- 19.5 and 104.6 +/- 22.7 N . m, respectively, p = .18) but was different between age groups independent of exercise status (107.6 +/- 18.4, 97.1 +/- 19.9, and 90.1 +/- 21.4 N . m, for 40s, 50s, and 60s, respectively, p < .05). Lean body mass also differed by age group (p < .05) but did not change differently among runners and sedentary women. These findings suggest that chronic endurance training might not influence the loss of muscle mass and muscle strength that occur with aging.
19878859	Technological and microbiological aspects of traditional balsamic vinegar and their influence on quality and sensorial properties.	aging	2009-??-??	The term "balsamic" is widespread and popular all over the world of vinegar and fancy foods; it is used generally to refer to vinegars and sauces with a sweet and sour taste. However, the original is the European Protected Denomination, registered as "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale of Modena, or of Reggio Emilia" that should not be confused with the "Aceto Balsamico di Modena" very similar in the name, but completely different for technology, raw material, quality, and sensorial properties. Traditional balsamic vinegar is made by a peculiar procedure, that starts with a thermal concentration of freshly squeezed grape juice, followed by alcoholic and acetic fermentations and, finally, long aging in a wooden barrel set, by a procedure which requires a partial transfer of vinegar from cask to cask with the consequential blending of vinegars of different ages. In addition, water transfer occurs across the wood of the barrels, the result being an increase of solute concentration of the vinega…
8778386	Color stability of facial prostheses.	aging	1995-12-??	The limited service of facial prostheses is the result of degradation of the elastomer and color instability. Deterioration may be caused by many factors, which include environmental exposure and changes in humidity. This investigation assessed the efficacy of an additive, intrinsic, broad-spectrum ultraviolet light absorber on the color stability of a pigmented facial elastomer. Samples were weathered artificially and outdoors at exposure levels of radiant energy of 150 to 450 kJ/m2. The samples changed color slightly but perceptibly. Artificial aging caused a greater change than outdoor aging. The ultraviolet light absorber UV-5411 did not protect the samples from color changes.
21871557	Negligible penetration of incidental amounts of alpha-hydroxy acid from rinse-off personal care products in human skin using an in vitro static diffusion cell model.	aging	2011-12-??	Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), primarily glycolic and lactic acids, are widely used in cosmetics to alleviate dyspigmentation, photodamage, and other aging skin conditions and as pH adjusters. Glycolic acid reportedly enhances skin damage after repeated ultraviolet light exposure, e.g., increased sunburn cell formation. This study assessed potential in vitro skin penetration of lactic acid and malic acid incorporated into rinse-off personal care products, compared with rinse-off and leave-on exposures to glycolic acid (10%, pH 3.5) in a reference lotion. Radiolabeled AHA-fortified shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were evenly applied as single doses to human epidermal membranes mounted in static diffusion cells (not occluded). Exposures were 1-3 min (rinse-off) or 24 h (leave-on). Epidermal penetration of malic acid and lactic acid from the rinse-off shampoo and conditioner, respectively, was negligible, with >99% removed by rinsing, a negligible portion remaining in the stratum corneum (≤…
23000523	Hydrolytic degradation of the resin-dentine interface induced by the simulated pulpal pressure, direct and indirect water ageing.	longevity	2012-12-??	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the hydrolytic effects induced by simulated pulpal pressure, direct or indirect water exposure within the resin-dentine interfaces created with three "simplified" resin bonding systems (RBSs).    METHODS: A two-step/self-etching (CSE: Clearfil SE Bond), one-step/self-etching (S3: Clearfil S3) and etch-and-rinse/self-priming (SB: Single-bond 2) adhesives were applied onto dentine and submitted to three different prolonged (6 or 12 months) ageing strategies: (i) Simulated Pulpal Pressure (SPP); (ii) Indirect Water Exposure (IWE: intact bonded-teeth); (iii) Direct Water Exposure (DWE: resin-dentine sticks). Control and aged specimens were submitted to microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and nanoleakage evaluation. Water sorption (WS) survey was also performed on resin disks. Results were analysed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0.05).    RESULTS: The μTBS of CS3 and SB dropped significantly (p < 0.05) after 6 months of SPP and DWE. C…
23966146	Body composition, muscle strength and quality of active elderly women according to the distance covered in the 6-minute walk test.	aging	????-??-??	BACKGROUND: Changes arising from the aging process, particularly changes in body composition, contribute to the functional decline of the elderly.    OBJECTIVE: To compare the body composition and muscle strength, mobility and quality in active elderly women according to the distance walked during the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).    METHOD: The study included 77 active elderly women aged 65 to 80 years, who were divided into tertiles (A, B and C) according to the distance covered in the 6MWT. We performed anthropometric and clinical evaluations. Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured with a portable dynamometer (Saehan), and knee extension strength (KES) was measured with the one repetition maximum test (1-RM). Functional mobility was assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and body balance was assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Muscle quality was defined by the ratio between muscle strength (kgf) and mus…
18070833	Sleeping well, aging well: a descriptive and cross-sectional study of sleep in "successful agers" 75 and older.	aging	2008-01-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine diary-based, laboratory-based, and actigraphic measures of sleep in a group of healthy older women and men (> or =75 years of age) without sleep/wake complaints and to describe sleep characteristics which may be correlates of health-related quality of life in old age.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study.    SETTING: University-based sleep and chronobiology program.    INTERVENTION: None.    PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four older adults (30 women, 34 men; mean age 79).    MEASUREMENTS: We used diary-, actigraphic-, and laboratory-based measures of sleep, health-related quality of life, mental health, social support, and coping strategies. We used two-group t-tests to compare baseline demographic and clinical measures between men and women, followed by ANOVA on selected EEG measures to examine first-night effects as evidence of physiological adaptability. Finally, we examined correlations between measure of sleep and health-related quality of life.    RESULTS: We…
16271756	The effect of real-time aging on the oxidation and wear of highly cross-linked UHMWPE acetabular liners.	aging	2006-03-??	Irradiation decreases the wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) but generates residual free radicals, precursors to long-term oxidation. Melting or annealing is used in quenching free radicals. We hypothesized that irradiated and once-annealed UHMWPE would oxidize while irradiated and melted UHMWPE would not, and that the oxidation in the former would increase wear. Acetabular liners were real-time aged by immersion in an aqueous environment that closely mimicked the temperature and oxygen concentration of synovial fluid. After 95 weeks of real-time aging, once-annealed components were oxidized; the melted components were not. The wear rate of the real-time aged irradiated and once-annealed components was higher than the literature reported values of other contemporary highly cross-linked UHMWPEs. Single annealing after irradiation used with terminal gamma sterilization may adversely affect the long-term oxidative stability of UHMWPE components.
30453505	Regular Practice of Moderate Physical Activity by Older Adults Ameliorates Their Anti-Inflammatory Status.	aging	2018-11-16	A chronic inflammatory state is a major characteristic of the aging process, and physical activity is proposed as a key component for healthy aging. Our aim was to evaluate the body composition, hypertension, lipid profile, and inflammatory status of older adults, and these factors' association with physical activity. A total of 116 elderly volunteers were categorized into terciles of quantitative metabolic equivalents of task (MET). Subjects in the first and third terciles were defined as sedentary and active subjects, respectively. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters, hemograms, and inflammatory markers were measured in plasma or peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). The active groups exercised more than their sedentary counterparts. The practice of physical activity was accompanied by lower weight, fat mass, body mass index, and diastolic blood pressure when compared to a more sedentary life-style. Physical activity also lowered the haematocrit and total leukocyte, neutr…
9888582	The molecular basis of isolated 17,20 lyase deficiency.	aging	????-??-??	Human P450c17 catalyzes the 17alpha-hydroxylation of pregnenolone to 17OH pregnenolone and of progesterone to 17alpha-OH progesterone; the same P450c17 enzyme also catalyzes 17,20 lyase activity on the same active site, converting 17OH-pregnenolone to DHEA. Rodent and porcine P450c17 also catalyze 17,20 lyase activity with delta4 substrates, converting 17OH-progesterone to delta4 androstenedione, but human P450c17 catalyzes this reaction very inefficiently, so that virtually all human C19 sex steroids are made via 17OH pregnenolone and DHEA. P450c17 is encoded by a single gene and a single species of mRNA. Many mutations of this gene have been described, but until recently all of these either entirely eliminated both 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activity, or affected each activity equivalently. We have identified and characterized the first patients with P450c17 mutations that selectively ablate 17,20 lyase activity while retaining 17alpha-hydroxylase activity. Through a combina…
11880821	Creatine supplementation improves muscular performance in older men.	aging	2002-03-??	PURPOSE: Creatine supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle strength and power after only 5-7 d in young adults. Creatine supplementation could therefore benefit older individuals because aging is associated with a decrease in muscle strength and explosive power.    METHODS: We examined the effects of 7 d of creatine supplementation in normally active older men (59-72 yr) by using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design with repeated measures. After a 3-wk familiarization period to minimize learning effects, a battery of tests was completed on three occasions separated by 7 d (T1, T2, and T3). After T1, subjects were matched and randomly assigned into creatine (N = 10) and placebo (N = 8) groups. After T2, subjects consumed supplements (0.3 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 7 d until T3. All subjects were tested for maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum leg press and bench press), maximal isometric strength (knee extension/flexion), upper- and lower-body explosive power (6 x …
23282796	Navigating hardships in old age: exploring the relationship between spirituality and resilience in later life.	aging	2013-04-??	Research suggests that spirituality is important to a large percentage of the older adult population and serves as a promoter of healthy aging. In this qualitative research I conducted and analyzed multiple interviews with 6 women aged 80 and older. Using multiple in-depth interviews I explored the interplay between spirituality and resilience over the life course. A grounded theory analysis of the 30 interviews was performed. The major finding is that participants used their spirituality as a tool to promote and maintain resilience in later life. I present the results as an interpretation of the participants' perceptions of their spirituality, and indicate their reliance on spirituality to overcome hardship over the life course. In addition, I discuss the connections between spirituality and resilience. The roles these two constructs play in the lives of older adults are considered.
27791396	Citrullination and deamidation affect aggregation properties of amyloid β-proteins.	aging	2016-12-??	Citrullination and deamidation, which are aging-related posttranslational modifications, increase the number of negative charges on amyloid β-protein (Aβ) at neutral pH. We investigated the effects of these modifications on the fibrillation properties of Aβ. The Arg5→Cit modification of Aβ did not affect the fibrillation rate, and brought β-sheet structures unlike that in the Aβ fibril. The Asn27→Asp modification of Aβ stopped the fibrillation and induced the formation of aggregates that involved an anti-parallel β-sheet. Aβ with the Arg5→Cit modification showed increased solubility in aqueous media, and its fibril formation became slower than that of Aβ. The modification did not change the parallel β-sheet structure of the fibrils. Aβ with the Asn27→Asp modification partially formed fibrils that involved the parallel β-sheet structure. Using the thioflavin T (ThT) assay, an increased fraction of the soluble oligomer of each Aβ analog was transiently detected during fibrillation. An in…
21498840	A prospective population-based study of differences in elder self-neglect and mortality between black and white older adults.	aging	2011-06-??	BACKGROUND: Self-neglect is the behavior of an elderly person that threatens his or her own health and safety, and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although report of self-neglect is more common among black older adults, the racial/ethnic differences in mortality remain unclear.    METHODS: The Chicago Healthy Aging Project is a population-based cohort study conducted from 1993 to 2005. A subset of these participants were suspected to self-neglect and were reported to a social services agency. Mortality was ascertained during follow-up and from the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the mortality risk.    RESULTS: In the total cohort, there were 5,963 black and 3,475 white older adults, and of these, 1,479 were reported for self-neglect (21.7% in black and 5.3% in white older adults). In multivariable analyses with extensive adjustments, the interaction term indicated that impact of self-neglect on mortality was significant…
16913878	Insulin resistance, oxidative stress, hypertension, and leukocyte telomere length in men from the Framingham Heart Study.	aging	2006-08-??	Insulin resistance and oxidative stress are associated with accelerated telomere attrition in leukocytes. Both are also implicated in the biology of aging and in aging-related disorders, including hypertension. We explored the relations of leukocyte telomere length, expressed by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length, with insulin resistance, oxidative stress and hypertension. We measured leukocyte TRF length in 327 Caucasian men with a mean age of 62.2 years (range 40-89 years) from the Offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. TRF length was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.41, P < 0.0001) and age-adjusted TRF length was inversely correlated with the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (r =-0.16, P = 0.007) and urinary 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) (r = -0.16, P = 0.005) - an index of systemic oxidative stress. Compared with their normotensive peers, hypertensive subjects exhibited shorter age-adjusted TRF length (hypertensives = 5.93 +/- 0.042 kb, normote…
25101957	Modulation of PPARγ provides new insights in a stress induced premature senescence model.	aging	2014-??-??	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) may be involved in a key mechanism of the skin aging process, influencing several aspects related to the age-related degeneration of skin cells, including antioxidant unbalance. Therefore, we investigated whether the up-modulation of this nuclear receptor exerts a protective effect in a stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) model based on a single exposure of human dermal fibroblasts to 8-methoxypsoralen plus + ultraviolet-A-irradiation (PUVA). Among possible PPARγ modulators, we selected 2,4,6-octatrienoic acid (Octa), a member of the parrodiene family, previously reported to promote melanogenesis and antioxidant defense in normal human melanocytes through a mechanism involving PPARγ activation. Exposure to PUVA induced an early and significant decrease in PPARγ expression and activity. PPARγ up-modulation counteracted the antioxidant imbalance induced by PUVA and reduced the expression of stress response genes with a syner…
30053619	Frailty in older-age European migrants: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).	aging	2018-??-??	Frailty correlates with morbidity and is superior to chronological age in predicting mortality. Frailty of older migrants has important implications for the demands placed on healthcare systems. Examining 95,635 Europeans in the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between migration and frailty at ages >50 years. We examined whether associations differed by countries' level of healthcare coverage and access for migrants and tested mediation by home-ownership and citizenship. Cross-sectionally, first-generation migrants >50 years old were, on average, 16.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.6, 18.2%) frailer than non-migrants after confounder-adjustment. This decreased to 12.1% (95% CI: 10.1, 14.1%) after adjustment for citizenship. The strength of association between migrant status and frailty was greater in migrants from low-or-middle-income countries, compared with migrants from high-income countries. Migrants…
28332116	Sweating Rate and Sweat Sodium Concentration in Athletes: A Review of Methodology and Intra/Interindividual Variability.	aging	2017-03-??	Athletes lose water and electrolytes as a consequence of thermoregulatory sweating during exercise and it is well known that the rate and composition of sweat loss can vary considerably within and among individuals. Many scientists and practitioners conduct sweat tests to determine sweat water and electrolyte losses of athletes during practice and competition. The information gleaned from sweat testing is often used to guide personalized fluid and electrolyte replacement recommendations for athletes; however, unstandardized methodological practices and challenging field conditions can produce inconsistent/inaccurate results. The primary objective of this paper is to provide a review of the literature regarding the effect of laboratory and field sweat-testing methodological variations on sweating rate (SR) and sweat composition (primarily sodium concentration [Na]). The simplest and most accurate method to assess whole-body SR is via changes in body mass during exercise; however, potent…
28532299	Role of objectively measured sedentary behaviour in physical performance, frailty and mortality among older adults: A short systematic review.	aging	2017-08-??	Sedentary behaviour (SB) has recently emerged as an independent risk factor for different health outcomes. Older adults accumulate long time in SB. Understanding the role that SB plays on health is crucial for a successful aging. This short systematic review summarizes the current evidence related to the effects of objectively measured SB on frailty, physical performance and mortality in adults ≥60 years old. The literature search produced 271 records for physical performance (n = 119), frailty (n = 31), and mortality (n = 121). Finally, only 13 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All articles but one included in the physical performance section (n = 9) showed a negative association between longer time spent in SB and physical performance. A significant association of SB with higher odds of frailty was found, however this association disappeared after adjusting for cognitive status. Lastly, two of the three included studies showed positive associ…
2626758	Production of free radicals arising from the surface activity of minerals and oxygen. Part II. Arsenides, sulfides, and sulfoarsenides of iron, nickel, and copper.	aging	1989-12-??	The excess incidence of lung cancers observed in metallic mines other than iron mines probably can be correlated not only to radioactivity, but also to dust pollution. The present work investigates the role of surface properties of sulfides and arsenides, which are present in metal mines, in oxidizing mechanisms capable of inducing oxidative stress and, possibly, of participating in carcinogenesis. Using added spin-trapping agent followed by ESR spectroscopy, it was observed that nickel and copper arsenides can be very active in the oxidation of formate or DMSO, by reducing the oxygen dissolved in a cell-free medium. Sulfides, on the other hand, are not active, except for the iron sulfides, which are very active as an air-aged powder. The process of activation and rendering the particle surface passive was investigated. Surface dissolution and moderate grinding were found to be activating factors, while air-aging generally rendered the particle surface passive. The critical factor in d…
8981883	Overview of polyethylene as a bearing material: comparison of sterilization methods.	aging	1996-12-??	Polyethylene has been used for more than 30 years as an orthopaedic bearing material; however, there has been recent concern regarding the early failure of a small percentage of the polyethylene bearings. The damage seen in some retrieved polyethylene components has been linked to gamma radiation sterilization in air, which was widely used by the industry for years. Gamma radiation in air has been documented to cause an increase in oxidation and degradation of mechanical properties with time. The degradation of polyethylene initiated by gamma sterilization in air has led the orthopaedic industry toward alternative sterilization methods, including gamma radiation in an inert gas or vacuum environment, ethylene oxide gas sterilization, and gas plasma sterilization. For many of these alternative techniques, little clinical performance data exist. This study is a comparative evaluation of sterilization methods using the same analytic techniques that have been used to document the effects o…
20966635	Low-dose UVB irradiation stimulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression via a BLT2-linked pathway in HaCaT cells.	aging	2010-12-31	Skin exposure to low-dose ultraviolet B (UVB) light up-regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), thus contributing to premature skin aging (photo-aging). Although cyclooxygenase-2 (COX- 2) and its product, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE((2))), have been associated with UVB-induced signaling to MMP expression, very little are known about the roles of lipoxygenases and their products, especially leukotriene B((4)) (LTB((4))) and 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE), in MMP-1 expression in skin keratinocytes. In the present study, we demonstrate that BLT2, a cell surface receptor for LTB((4)) and 12(S)-HETE, plays a critical role in UVB-mediated MMP-1 upregulation in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Moreover, our results demonstrated that BLT2-mediated MMP-1 upregulation occurs through a signaling pathway dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the subsequent stimulation of ERK. Blockage of BLT2 via siRNA knockdown or with the BLT2-antagonist LY255283…
10198430	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 helicase efficiently unwinds G-G paired DNAs.	aging	1999-05-01	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase localizes to the nucleolus and is required to maintain the integrity of the rDNA repeats. Sgs1p is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, which also includes Schizo-saccharomyces pombe Rqh1, and the human BLM and WRN genes. These genes encode proteins which are essential to maintenance of genomic integrity and which share a highly conserved helicase domain. Here we show that recombinant Sgs1p helicase efficiently unwinds guanine-guanine (G-G) paired DNA. Unwinding of G-G paired DNA is ATP- and Mg2+-dependent and requires a short 3' single-stranded tail. Strikingly, Sgs1p unwinds G-G paired substrates more efficiently than duplex DNAs, as measured either in direct assays or by competition experiments. Sgs1p efficiently unwinds G-G paired telomeric sequences, suggesting that one function of Sgs1p may be to prevent telomere-telomere interactions which can lead to chromosome non-disjunction. The rDNA is G-rich and has considerable potential fo…
8538242	Protective effect of vitamin E on lymphocyte growth capacity during incubation in vitro.	aging	1995-08-08	Vitamin E, an essential lipid-soluble micronutrient, plays an important role in the immune system and serves as an immunostimulant in geriatric subjects. Using an in vitro incubation to simulate aging processes, we find that vitamin E mitigates loss of growth capacity in lymphocytes. Vitamin E presence during in vitro incubation did not affect significantly the level of peroxidation, the effects of exogenous IL-2, PGE2, or indomethacin, nor levels of IL-2 production. Thus, the preservative effect on lymphocyte growth by vitamin E is not due primarily to its antioxidant function or to interleukin-2 or prostaglandin effects. The decreased growth capacity generated by in vitro incubation is accompanied by a variety of cellular alterations, including decreased CD5 surface antigen, enhanced suppression by adherent cells, and impaired communication between lymphocytes and adherent cells. The decrease in CD5 surface antigen correlates inversely with the cell density required for maximal cell …
11792715	Crystal structure of human L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase.	aging	2002-03-22	The enzyme l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase initiates the repair of damaged proteins by recognizing and methylating isomerized and racemized aspartyl residues in aging proteins. The crystal structure of the human enzyme containing a bound S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine cofactor is reported here at a resolution of 2.1 A. A comparison of the human enzyme to homologs from two other species reveals several significant differences among otherwise similar structures. In all three structures, we find that three conserved charged residues are buried in the protein interior near the active site. Electrostatics calculations suggest that these buried charges might make significant contributions to the energetics of binding the charged S-adenosyl-l-methionine cofactor and to catalysis. We suggest a possible structural explanation for the observed differences in reactivity toward the structurally similar l-isoaspartyl and d-aspartyl residues in the human, archael, and eubacterial enzymes. Finally, the hu…
17490460	Difference in breathing strategies during exercise between trained elderly men and women.	aging	2008-04-??	This study compared the ventilatory responses and exercise tidal flow-volume (Vt) loops during exercise in order to analyze the influence of gender on breathing strategy in a fit aging population. Sixteen trained elderly men (63.0+/-2.9 years) and eight peer women (62.3 +/- 5.5 years) performed an incremental test on a cycle ergometer. At 90% maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), the women presented a significantly higher expiratory flow limitation (EFL) than the men (38 +/- 10 vs 17 +/- 8% of Vt, respectively) (P<0.01) and a lower value of expiratory reserve volume relative to forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with the men (16.8 +/- 5.3% vs 23.0 +/- 5.2%, respectively) (P<0.05). Inspiratory reserve volume relative to FVC was significantly higher in women than men at 50% (P<0.05), 70% (P<0.01) and 90%VO2max (25.2 +/- 5.4% vs 12.2 +/- 4.2%, respectively, at 90%VO2max) (P<0.01). Mechanical ventilatory constraints occurred in trained elderly men and women. However, different breathing s…
15917154	HRT provides no additional beneficial effect on sarcopenia in physically active postmenopausal women: a cross-sectional, observational study.	aging	2005-06-16	OBJECTIVES: Physical activity can prevent or retard the loss of muscle mass associated with aging. On the other hand, it has been suggested that HRT may also help prevent sarcopenia in postmenopausal women. We thus examined if HRT provides additional beneficial effect in physically active postmenopausal women.    METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women aged between 55 and 65 years old (normal weight, healthy and no medication) were recruited. Seventeen women were already taking HRT for at least one year whereas 23 were never submitted to HRT. Body composition was measured by DXA and physical activity metabolism was obtained by the use of accelerometry. Subjects were divided in tertile groups based on their daily physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE).    RESULTS: Physical activity groups were similar for age, HRT users distribution, BMI, trunk fat-free mass (FFM), and all fat mass (FM) components. The group of women who were the most physically active significantly displayed greater t…
18585103	Human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 protein and gene are expressed more abundantly in the superficial than basal layer of human epidermis.	aging	2008-09-01	Human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) repairs 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) which results from oxidation of guanine. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation cause this DNA damage, which is involved in pathological processes such as carcinogenesis and aging. The initiation of skin tumors probably requires penetration of UV to the actively dividing basal layer of the epidermis in order for acute damage to become fixed as mutations. Previously, the majority of UVB fingerprint mutations have been found in the upper layers of human skin tumors, while UVA mutations have been found mostly in the lower layer. Our aim was to determine whether this localization of UVA-induced DNA damage is related to stratification of the repair-enzyme hOGG1. Anti-hOGG1 immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections of human foreskin, adult buttock skin, and reconstructed human skin samples showed the highest expression of hOGG1 in the superficial e…
10730642	Intraventricular CSF pulsation artifact on fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery MR images: analysis of 100 consecutive normal studies.	aging	2000-03-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF pulsation artifact is a pitfall of fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) brain MR imaging. We studied ventricular CSF pulsation artifact (VCSFA) on axial FLAIR images and its relationship to age and ventricular size.    METHODS: Fast FLAIR axial images were obtained on a 1.5-T unit (8000/150/2 [TR/TE/ excitations], inversion time = 2200, field of view = 24 cm, matrix = 189x256, and 5-mm interleaved sections). Two observers rated VCSFA (hyperintensity on FLAIR images) in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by using a three-point ordinal scale in 100 consecutive subjects (ages 20-86 years) with normal brain MR studies. Left-to-right third ventricular width was also measured.    RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects had VCSFA in at least one ventricular cavity. The fourth ventricle was the most common site of VCSFA (n = 58), followed by the third ventricle (n = 47) and the lateral ventricles (n = 13). VCSFA was usually severe in the third and fourth ve…
25666574	Gait energetic efficiency in older adults with and without knee pain: results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.	aging	2015-02-??	With aging, customary gait patterns change and energetic efficiency declines, but the relationship between these alterations is not well understood. If gait characteristics that develop with aging explain part of the decline in energetic efficiency that occur in most aging individuals, then efforts to modify these characteristics could delay or prevent mobility limitation. This study characterizes gait patterns in older persons with and without knee pain and tests the hypothesis that changes in gait characteristics due to knee pain are associated with increased energetic cost of walking in older adults. Study participants were 364 men and 170 women aged 60 to 96 years enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), of whom 86 had prevalent knee pain. Gait patterns were assessed at participant self-selected usual pace in the gait laboratory, and the energetic cost of walking was assessed by indirect calorimetry during self-selected usual pace walking over 2.5 min in a tile…
7554641	The Otto Aufranc Award. Impact of gamma sterilization on clinical performance of polyethylene in the hip.	aging	1995-10-??	Despite studies to determine their causes, significant variations in polyethylene acetabular component wear rates, radial cracking of component rims, and occasional delamination cannot be explained. A subsurface white band frequently occurs in such damaged components. These damaged components often are gamma sterilized. To date, the origin of the band and its effect on polyethylene chemical and mechanical properties, and hence, clinical performance, have not been confirmed, and correlations between radiation sterilization and clinical wear have not been made. By developing techniques for polyethylene retrieval testing and rating, chemical analysis, and mechanical analysis, this research has determined that gamma sterilization in air alters the chemical and mechanical properties of polyethylene over time, resulting in high subsurface oxidation, reduced ductility, and reduced strength. Gamma sterilization-induced oxidation is found to be most severe in the subsurface region of components…
9511106	Free radicals and side products released during methylmethacrylate polymerization are cytotoxic for osteoblastic cells.	aging	1998-04-??	Polymerization of orthopedic cements makes use of a peroxide initiator which is decomposed by an accelerator to provide free radicals. Free radicals which act on the monomer molecules are also known to induce cell lesions and cell death. We used an in vitro model of cement polymerization to study the effects of free radicals release on osteoblast-like cells. Initiation of methylmethacrylate was done with benzoyl peroxide and acceleration by N,N-dimethylaniline. Bulk polymerization was done in calibrated test tubes which were left aging until use. Polymers (aged from J1 to J31 days after completion of the polymerization process) were sawed to produce slices. Slices were rinsed in distilled water and free radical release was measured by spectrophotometric titration with p-iodonitrotetrazolium. Saos-2 osteoblast-like cells were cultured in parallel on the slices. Cells appeared to be round and were altered when grown on slices prepared freshly after polymerization. Cytomorphometric analys…
14657243	WRN helicase and FEN-1 form a complex upon replication arrest and together process branchmigrating DNA structures associated with the replication fork.	aging	2004-02-??	Werner Syndrome is a premature aging disorder characterized by genomic instability, elevated recombination, and replication defects. It has been hypothesized that defective processing of certain replication fork structures by WRN may contribute to genomic instability. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses show that WRN and Flap Endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) form a complex in vivo that colocalizes in foci associated with arrested replication forks. WRN effectively stimulates FEN-1 cleavage of branch-migrating double-flap structures that are the physiological substrates of FEN-1 during replication. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that WRN helicase unwinds the chicken-foot HJ intermediate associated with a regressed replication fork and stimulates FEN-1 to cleave the unwound product in a structure-dependent manner. These results provide evidence for an interaction between WRN and FEN-1 in vivo and suggest that these proteins function together to process DNA structures associate…
24503715	Induced effects of advanced oxidation processes.	aging	2014-02-07	Hazardous organic wastes from industrial, military, and commercial activities represent one of the greatest challenges to human beings. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are alternatives to the degradation of those organic wastes. However, the knowledge about the exact mechanisms of AOPs is still incomplete. Here we report a phenomenon in the AOPs: induced effects, which is a common property of combustion reaction. Through analysis EDTA oxidation processes by Fenton and UV-Fenton system, the results indicate that, just like combustion, AOPs are typical induction reactions. One most compelling example is that pre-feeding easily oxidizable organic matter can promote the oxidation of refractory organic compound when it was treated by AOPs. Connecting AOPs to combustion, it is possible to achieve some helpful enlightenment from combustion to analyze, predict and understand AOPs. In addition, we assume that maybe other oxidation reactions also have induced effects, such as corrosion, agin…
21456617	Generation of volatile compounds in litchi wine during winemaking and short-term bottle storage.	aging	2011-05-11	Evolution of volatile components during litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) winemaking was monitored, and aroma profiles of litchi wines bottle aged for 5 months at ambient temperature (25-28 °C) and low temperature (8-10 °C) were compared via headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The majority of terpenoids deriving from litchi juice decreased, even disappeared along with alcoholic fermentation, while terpenol oxides, ethers, and acetates came into being and increased. Ethyl octanote, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butanoate, cis-rose oxide, and trans-rose oxide had the highest odor activity values (OAVs) in young litchi wines. Six aromatic series were obtained by grouping OAVs of odor-active compounds with similar odor descriptions to establish the aroma profile for young litchi wines, and floral and fruity attributes were two major aroma series. Compared to ambient temperature when bottle aging, lower temperature …
7113649	Erythrocyte spectrofluorometric abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy during "in vitro" aging.	aging	????-??-??	The possibility in Myotonic dystrophy (MyD) that a decreased ATP utilization by the membrane may produce modifications in glycoprotein structure and/or in the supramolecular arrangement of some membrane proteins was investigated in human erythrocytes: a) by determining the membrane sialic acid content and the cellular ATP concentration in eight cases of MyD; b) by evaluating the stability of the membrane glycoprotein structure by in vitro ageing experiments; c) by testing the presence of high molecular weight aggregates of proteins on the membrane; d) by evaluating the physico-chemical properties of the membrane by 1-anilino 8-naftalensulfonate as a fluorescent probe. Our evidence suggests that ATP concentration and membrane sialic acid content are within normal values. Only in two cases did a decreased stability of membrane glycoproteins occur while the supramolecular assembly of membrane proteins could be considered as normal. The fluorescent probe behavior after in vitro aging was i…
9048391	Radiation-induced physical changes in UHMWPE implant components.	aging	1997-02-??	Post-irradiation aging of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is not well understood. Retrieval studies and in vitro aged specimens have shown oxidative changes along with increases in crystallinity. Critical analysis and review of the polymer science and polymer physics literature shows that while oxidation may be important during the first year post-irradiation, subsequent aging occurs because of initial gamma radiation-induced chain scission leading to eventual isothermal crystallization of polymer chains in the amorphous regions of the UHMWPE bulk. Mechanical properties of aged UHMWPE are not as yet clear and, until such data become available, gamma irradiation sterilization must be used with caution.
20561849	Comparison of prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility in elderly patients with heart failure, myocardial infarction, and a coronary artery bypass graft.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and hostility among 3 clinically diverse elderly cardiac patient cohorts and a reference group of healthy elders.    METHODS: This was a multicenter, comparative study. A total of 1167 individuals participated: 260 healthy elders, and 907 elderly cardiac patients who were at least 3 months past a hospitalization (478 heart-failure patients, 298 postmyocardial infarction patients, and 131 postcoronary artery bypass graft patients). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility were measured using the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist.    RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and hostility was higher in patients in each of the cardiac patient groups than in the group of healthy elders. Almost three quarters of patients with heart failure reported experiencing symptoms of depression, and the heart-failure group manifested the greatest percentage of patients with depressive symptoms.    CONCLUSIONS:…
24151513	p53/p21 Pathway involved in mediating cellular senescence of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients.	aging	2013-??-??	Our and other groups have found that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients exhibited senescent behavior and are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Numerous studies have shown that activation of the p53/p21 pathway inhibits the proliferation of BM-MSCs. The aim of this study was to determine whether p53/p21 pathway is involved in regulating the aging of BM-MSCs from SLE patients and the underlying mechanisms. We further confirmed that BM-MSCs from SLE patients showed characteristics of senescence. The expressions of p53 and p21 were significantly increased, whereas levels of Cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase-2, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein were decreased in the BM-MSCs from SLE patients and knockdown of p21 expression reversed the senescent features of BM-MSCs from SLE patients. Our results demonstrated that p53/p21 pathway played an important role in the senescence process of BM-MSCs from SLE.
28026094	Phenotypic characteristics of aged CD4<sup>+</sup> CD28<sup>null</sup> T lymphocytes are determined by changes in the whole-genome DNA methylation pattern.	aging	2017-??-??	Aging is associated with a progressive loss of the CD28 costimulatory molecule in CD4 lymphocytes (CD28 T cells), which is accompanied by the acquisition of new biological and functional properties that give rise to an impaired immune response. The regulatory mechanisms that govern the appearance and function of this cell subset during aging and in several associated inflammatory disorders remain controversial. Here, we present the whole-genome DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of CD28 T cells and its CD28 counterpart. A comparative analysis revealed that 296 genes are differentially methylated between the two cell subsets. A total of 160 genes associated with cytotoxicity (e.g. GRZB, TYROBP, and RUNX3) and cytokine/chemokine signaling (e.g. CX3CR1, CD27, and IL-1R) are demethylated in CD28 T cells, while 136 de novo-methylated genes matched defects in the TCR signaling pathway (e.g. ITK, TXK, CD3G, and LCK). TCR-landscape analysis confirmed that CD28 T cells have an oligo/m…
3730043	Determinants of lipid and lipoprotein level in elderly men.	longevity	1986-06-??	In an effort to better understand the relationship existing between lipoprotein pattern and longevity, we studied the lipid and lipoprotein distribution of 94 men over age 80 who lived in a nursing home, and assessed the role of selective mortality, body mass and sex hormone secretion in determining these distributions. High density lipoprotein subfraction and serum testosterone measurements were obtained on subsamples. The main findings were: (a) Presence of a lipoprotein pattern characterized by low LDL (total serum cholesterol: 179.6 +/- 36.0 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol: 106.3 +/- 31.2 mg/dl) and high HDL2 cholesterol (18.5 +/- 10.2 mg/dl) levels. (b) Occurrence of a positive association between LDL and HDL3 (r = 0.51, P less than 0.01), resulting in an overall high HDL2/HDL3 ratio. Mortality over a 6-month period was directly related to LDL level and possibly inversely related to HDL2 level, suggesting that selective mortality played a major role in determining the pattern observed. Bod…
22051569	Exercise increases tryptophan availability to the brain in older men age 57-70 years.	aging	2012-05-??	PURPOSE: Many aspects of serotonergic activity, both central and peripheral in origin, undergo significant changes with human aging. These alterations might predispose elderly people to develop mood disorders. Because previous work showed that increasing the peripheral availability of tryptophan (TRP) to the brain holds antidepressant properties, this study evaluated whether TRP availability to the brain is increased during prolonged exercise in older men.    METHODS: Nineteen males age 64 ± 3 yr completed a treadmill exercise bout at an HR eliciting ∼68% V˙O(2peak) for 60 min. Fasting blood was collected at rest, after 30 and 60 min of exercise, and at 90 min (after exercise). Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), total and free TRP, prolactin, ammonia, nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and lactate were measured.    RESULTS: Changes in free TRP/BCAA ratio and prolactin were used as peripheral proxies of central serotonin synthesis rate and activity. The free TRP/BCAA ratio observed at …
24602767	Epigenetic influences on associations between air pollutants and lung function in elderly men: the normative aging study.	aging	2014-06-??	BACKGROUND: Few studies have been performed on pulmonary effects of air pollution in the elderly--a vulnerable population with low reserve capacity--and mechanisms and susceptibility factors for potential effects are unclear.    OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the lag structure of air pollutant associations with lung function and potential effect modification by DNA methylation (< or ≥ median) at 26 individual CpG sites in nine candidate genes in a well-characterized cohort of elderly men.    METHODS: We measured forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and blood DNA methylation one to four times between 1999 and 2009 in 776 men from the Normative Aging Study. Air pollution was measured at fixed monitors 4 hr to 28 days before lung function tests. We used linear mixed-effects models to estimate the main effects of air pollutants and effect modification by DNA methylation.    RESULTS: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in subchronic exposure (3 to 28 days cumul…
15927542	Non-invasive respiratory monitoring during wakefulness and sleep in pre- and postmenopausal women.	aging	2006-01-25	Menopause and aging cause hormonal changes with respiratory consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiological changes in respiration during wakefulness and sleep across menopause in non-patient population using non-invasive measurements of blood and tissue gases. The arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2), heart rate, end-tidal partial carbon dioxide tension (EtCO2) and transcutaneous partial carbon dioxide tension (TcCO2) were measured during wakefulness and sleep in thirteen pairs of BMI-matched pre- and postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women had lower SaO2 during sleep than during wakefulness, whereas premenopausal women maintained their wakefulness SaO2 levels also during sleep. EtCO2 levels did not change either between wakefulness and sleep or between premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. TcCO2 levels increased from wakefulness to sleep in both groups and the increase was greater in the postmenopausal group. The impact of sleep on the non-in…
12590484	Identification of key odorants related to the typical aroma of oxidation-spoiled white wines.	aging	2003-02-26	The oxidative degradation of white wines rapidly leads to a loss of their sensorial qualities. The identification of the most important descriptors related with oxidation-spoiled wine was performed by a trained sensory panel. The terms selected were "honey-like", "farm-feed", "hay", and "woody-like". By gas chromatography-olfactometry analysis three aromatic zones related to these descriptors in the oxidation-spoiled white wines could be determined. Comparison of the aroma extract dilution analysis aromagrams of oxidation-spoiled white wines and a nonspoiled wine showed the highest values of dilution factors were attributed to 3-(methylthio)propionaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN), and 4,5-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (sotolon). A "forced aging" experiment was implemented to simulate the typical oxidation-spoiled aroma. Samples rated with the highest score in the ranking test were also those that presented the highest concentration of these…
20828248	The effect of circulating estradiol concentrations on gonadotropin secretion in young and old castrated male-to-female transsexuals.	aging	2011-09-??	CONTEXT: In aging men, circulating testosterone (T) declines which is associated with an increase in the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) , albeit insufficient to maintain T at its original level. It has been speculated that a higher sensitivity of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary for the feedback effect of circulating sex hormones in older men is responsible.    OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of experimentally varied plasma levels of estradiol on the LH and FSH secretion in young and old castrated male-to-female transsexuals, in almost absence of T. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: In 10 healthy, young (mean age 37.6 ± 6.2 years) and 11 healthy, old (mean age 68.1 ± 7.0) male-to-female transsexuals after gonadectomy plasma estradiol levels were experimentally varied with estradiol patches (the first week 100 μg/day patches, the second week 50 μg/day, the third week 25 μg/day and the fourth week no patch was applied) and plasma levels of …
10029667	Oxidative damage elicited by imbalance of free radical scavenging enzymes is associated with large-scale mtDNA deletions in aging human skin.	aging	1999-01-25	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and impaired respiratory function have been demonstrated in various tissues of aged individuals. We hypothesized that age-dependent increase of ROS and free radicals production in mitochondria is associated with the accumulation of large-scale mtDNA deletions. In this study, we first confirmed that the proportion of mtDNA with the 4977 bp deletion in human skin tissues increases with age. We then investigated the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) content in skin tissues and lipid peroxides content of the skin fibroblasts from subjects of different ages. The results showed an age-dependent increase of 8-OH-dG level in the total DNA of skin tissues of the subjects above the age of 60 years. The specific content of malondialdehyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation, was also found to increase with age. On the other hand, we examined the enzyme activities of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase, and g…
29441614	Characterization of oily mature skin by biophysical and skin imaging techniques.	aging	2018-08-??	BACKGROUND: The skin is a complex biological system and may suffer change according to the environmental factors, as higher temperatures can increase sebum excretion, presenting oiliness and acne. These alterations can persist during the aging and provoke more changes in aged skin. In this study we evaluated the mature oily skin characteristics using biophysical and skin imaging techniques.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty healthy female subjects, aged between 39 and 55 years old were recruited and separated into 2 groups according to their skin type: normal/dry and oily skin. The skin was evaluated in terms of stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) sebum content, dermis thickness and echogenicity, skin microrelief, and pores content.    RESULTS: The mature oily skin presented no significant differences when compared to the normal/dry skin on the stratum corneum water content and TEWL parameters. The sebum content was significantly higher on the oily skin group. …
12464605	A novel transcriptional inhibitory element differentially regulates the cyclin D1 gene in senescent cells.	aging	2003-02-28	Senescent human diploid fibroblasts are unable to initiate DNA synthesis following mitogenic stimulation and adopt a unique gene expression profile distinct from young or quiescent cells. In this study, a novel transcriptional regulatory element was identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the cyclin D1 gene. We show that this element differentially suppresses cyclin D1 expression in young versus senescent fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed abundant complexes forming with young cell nuclear extracts compared with senescent cell nuclear extracts. Binding was maintained in young quiescent cells, showing that loss of this activity was specific to senescent cells and not an effect of cell cycle arrest. Site-directed mutagenesis within this cyclin D1 inhibitory element (DIE) abolished binding activity and selectively increased cyclin D1 promoter activity in young but not in senescent cells. Sequences with homology to the DIE were found in the 5'-untranslated regi…
22095542	Age determines longitudinal changes in body composition better than menopausal and bone status: the OFELY study.	aging	2012-03-??	Long-term body composition (BC) changes and their determinants have been rarely explored. We aimed to evaluate BC changes in French women from the Os des Femmes de Lyon (OFELY) cohort and to explore several determinants of those changes. At baseline, premenopausal (PreM) women (n = 145) had lower fat body mass (FM) and greater lean body mass (LM), relative skeletal muscle mass index (RASM), and total body bone mineral content (TBBMC) compared with untreated postmenopausal (PostM) women (n = 412). During a 6-year follow-up, LM and RASM did not change, whereas a significant increase of FM and a decrease of TBBMC were observed in PreM (n = 88) and PeriM women (n = 44; women who became PostM during the follow-up). In untreated PostM women, FM increased, whereas LM, RASM, and TBBMC decreased (p < 0.0001). Age was a significant determinant of the changes in BC. After controlling for age, menopausal status was still a significant determinant only for changes in TBBMC. FM, LM, RASM, and TBBMC …
27976618	Relationship between body composition and bone mineral density, related to physical activity, in elderly women.	aging	2016-12-01	Changes in body composition, including a decrease in muscle and bone mass, accompany aging. Analyse the influence of lean mass on bone mineral density, related to physical activity, in elderly women. 37 women were included in this study via an osteoporosis consultation. Body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry methodology (DXA). The BMD was measured at the femoral neck. Each participant had a physical activity test to respond and had to perform handgrip, a four meter walk and one leg balance. Simple regression analyze showed a positive association between lean masse et BMD; after multiple linear regression analysis, we found a positive association between BMD, lean mass, and one leg balance; lean masse and one leg balance were two independent variable. Bone Mineral density was signicantly associated to lean mass and one leg balance.
20837662	Benefits of cognitive dual-task training on balance performance in healthy older adults.	aging	2010-12-??	BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of the involvement of executive control in the maintenance of balance in old age. We examined whether healthy older adults who completed five sessions of nonmotor cognitive dual-task training would show significant improvements on measures of dual-task standing balance and mobility, compared with an untrained control group.    METHODS: Twenty healthy older adults were assigned to either training or control groups. In the pre- and post-training sessions, all participants performed tests of cognition, balance, and mobility (single-support balance, dynamic posturography, sit-to-stand, 40-foot walk) under single- and dual-task conditions. The training group completed five sessions of cognitive dual-task training spaced at least 2 days apart. The two tasks involved making two-choice decisions to visually presented stimuli. Participants completed multiple blocks of single-task (task A or B, blockwise) and mixed (A, B, or A + B) trials in each training se…
16826024	Age and activity status affect muscle reoxygenation time after maximal cycling exercise.	aging	2006-07-??	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the interaction of age and habitual physical activity on recovery time of muscle oxygenation following maximal cycling exercise (CycEXmax).    METHODS: Twelve sedentary middle-aged (50+/-6), 13 sedentary elderly (66+/-3), 13 active middle-aged (53+/-5), and 20 active elderly (67+/-5) women participated in this study. We evaluated the peak pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2peak) during CycEXmax and the half-recovery time of muscle oxygenation (T1/2reoxy time) using near-infrared spectroscopy at the vastus lateralis (VL) during the recovery phase after CycEXmax.    RESULTS: T1/2reoxy time was significantly greater in the elderly subjects than in the middle-aged subjects in both sedentary (P<0.05) and active groups (P<0.01). T1/2reoxy time of the active group was lower (P<0.01) than that of the sedentary group regardless of age. Age was significantly correlated to T1/2reoxy time in both sedentary and active groups (in both sedentary and active…
10081592	A methodology for examining the plausibility of accelerated aging protocols for UHMWPE components.	aging	1998-??-??	In light of the time-intensive nature of using real-time shelf-aged specimens in research into property changes of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), accelerated thermal diffusion oxidative aging (usually referred to as accelerated aging) is frequently resorted to. A number of such aging protocols have been reported in the literature, with various claims for their producing changes in the properties of the polymer being the same as or similar to those seen in real-time shelf-aged samples. The thrust of the present work is the presentation of a methodology for examining such claims. The methodology is applied to six properties (% crystallinity, melting temperature, oxidation index, ultimate tensile strength, ultimate tensile elongation, and tensile toughness) of 4150HP UHMWPE grade, sterilized using six different methods, prior to and following the use of a specific accelerated aging protocol (oxygen gas at 70 degrees C and 507 kPa pressure; 14 d.). These six properties …
1849453	Structural and functional investigations of cholinesterases by means of affinity electrophoresis.	aging	1991-02-??	1. After a brief survey of the basic affinity electrophoresis concepts, the usual ways for preparing affinity electrophoresis ligands are examined. 2. Then results obtained on cholinesterases are reviewed. This section includes (a) structural and functional investigations on anionic sites, i.e., study of ligand-induced conformational change, organophosphate-induced "aging," genetic variants, and active-site topology; and (b) characterization of cholinesterase conjugates (hybrid proteins) and glycoinositol phospholipid-anchored cholinesterases. 3. The future prospects of affinity electrophoresis, e.g., investigations on the esteratic site and exploration of the carbohydrate moiety, are emphasized in the concluding section.
1477192	Late cognitive event-related potentials in adult Down's syndrome.	aging	1992-12-15	Event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials (ERPs) using two different tasks were measured in 14 adults with Down's syndrome (DS; mean age 32 years) without clinically detectable cognitive decline. Two groups, young healthy (YH) and old healthy (OH) adults, served as controls. In the oddball task, DS had prolonged N1 and earlier P2 latencies than the control groups. P3 latency was delayed in comparison to YH. In the PushWait task, P3 latency was later in DS than in YH and OH. In both tasks, DS showed a marked amplitude shift towards positivity overlapping the N1-P2 complex and seemingly also P3: The P3 amplitude evoked by target tones and by "Push" was shifted towards anterior sites resulting in a Cz maximum. Changes of the N1 latency and amplitude in DS may be related to enhanced arousal during stimulus processing, indicating a possible defect of central inhibitory mechanisms. The study suggests that differentiated ERP procedures provide information on adult DS cognition excee…
20092322	Assessment of volatile and sensory profiles between base and sparkling wines.	aging	2010-02-24	This paper focuses on the study of the volatile, olfactometric, and sensory composition of base wines and their corresponding sparkling wines (14-24 months aging) obtained at semi-industrial scale during three consecutive harvests. The sensory profile of sparkling wine is more complex than that of base wine, with toasty, lactic, sweet, and yeasty notes being described by the panelists and an even sharper increase of these tastes in the cava reserve. On the other hand, during the second fermentation and subsequent aging in contact with lees, some compounds such as acetate and ethyl esters decrease in amount while others such as norisoprenoids, acetal, diacetyl, and furans appear or increase over time. These volatile compounds could be responsible for the sensory profile depending on their notes, as determined by sniffing. The differences in volatile composition are responsible for the changes observed in the sensory profile of cava with respect to base wine.
24862011	The commitment of human cells to senescence.	longevity, lifespan, aging	2014-??-??	Fifty years ago, it was demonstrated by Leonard Hayflick that human diploid fibroblasts grown in culture have a finite lifespan. Since that time, innumerable experiments have been published to discover the mechanism(s) that are responsible for this 'Hayflick limit' to continuous growth. Much new information has been gained, but there are certain features of this experimental system which have not been fully understood. One is the fact that different populations of the foetal lung strains WI-38 and MRC-5 have a range in division potential of at least a millionfold. The commitment theory of cellular aging, published more than 30 years ago, is able to explain this, but it has been consistently ignored. The theory predicts that bottlenecks, which are transient reductions in population size, can significantly reduce lifespan, or increase variability of lifespans. Computer simulations specify the effects of bottlenecks on longevity, and these were confirmed in two series of experiments. Comm…
20832068	Calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibits angiotensin II-induced endothelial progenitor cells senescence through up-regulation of klotho expression.	aging	2010-11-??	BACKGROUND: It has been shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) is able to accelerate endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) senescence through induction of oxidative stress. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a major neurotransmitter of the capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves, protects endothelial function. Whether CGRP protects against EPCs senescence is unknown.    METHODS AND RESULTS: In cord-derived EPCs, the effects of CGRP on Ang II-induced cell senescence were evaluated by exogenous application of CGRP and rutaecarpine (to stimulate the endogenous CGRP production) or by over-expression of CGRP. The anti-senescence mechanisms of CGRP on EPCs were investigated either by applying CGRP antagonist or by silence of klotho, an anti-aging protein. The results showed that both CGRP and klotho mRNA expression were reduced in Ang II-induced senescent EPCs. Exogenous application of CGRP inhibited Ang II-induced EPCs senescence by down-regulating the expression of NADPH oxidase and reactive oxy…
18605965	Mediterranean diet and plasma concentration of inflammatory markers in old and very old subjects in the ZINCAGE population study.	longevity, aging	2008-??-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with low-grade elevation of circulating inflammatory markers, leading to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The Mediterranean diet has been suggested as a determinant of longevity. In the current study, we investigated the impact of the Mediterranean diet on inflammatory status in old subjects.    METHODS: Within the ZINCAGE study, 957 healthy old subjects (>or=60 years old) from five European countries were recruited. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured. Dietary data were collected applying a food frequency questionnaire and were used to estimate adherence to the Mediterranean diet.    RESULTS: The Italians presented the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet, while the Polish the poorest. In females, higher diet score was significantly associated with lower body mass index and ESR …
7032824	Hypertension in the elderly: haemodynamic, fluid volume and endocrine findings.	aging	1981-12-??	1. Systemic and renal haemodynamics, intravascular volume, circulating catecholamines and plasma renin activity were measured in 18 patients with established essential hypertension who were older than 60 years of age. Each patient was matched with respect to mean arterial pressure, body surface area, race and sex with a patient that was younger than 42 years of age. 2. When compared with the younger group, elderly patients had a lower cardiac output, impaired myocardial reserve, lesser aortic elasticity, higher total peripheral resistance, more contracted intravascular volume and higher circulating noradrenaline levels. 3. Similar effects of age, although less pronounced, have been reported in normotensive subjects. We conclude that essential hypertension is a pathophysiological process that seems to accelerate the natural physiological haemodynamic, fluid volume and endocrine processes of aging.
18337828	Partial depletion of mitochondrial DNA from human skin fibroblasts induces a gene expression profile reminiscent of photoaged skin.	aging	2008-09-??	In photoaged skin, wrinkles result from an increased degradation and a decreased de novo synthesis of collagen fibers. At the molecular level, photoaged skin is characterized by increased amounts of large-scale deletions of the mitochondrial (mt) genome such as the 4,977 bp common deletion. The common deletion can be generated in dermal fibroblasts through repetitive ultraviolet (UV) A irradiation, and this was found to be associated with an increased expression of the collagen-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). These studies did not clarify whether increased MMP-1 expression was caused by a disturbance of mtDNA integrity or whether it occurred independently. We have therefore generated a phenocopy of cells bearing large-scale deletions of mtDNA by gradually depleting the mtDNA from unirradiated human skin fibroblasts. Gradual depletion of mtDNA caused a gene expression profile, which was reminiscent of that observed in photoaged skin. Accordingly, in these cells an i…
25841365	EGCG prevents tryptophan oxidation of cataractous ocular lens human γ-crystallin in presence of H2O2.	aging	2015-??-??	Disruption of the short range order of proteins present in the ocular lens leads to cataract resulting in a loss of transparency. Human γ-crystallin (HGC), a water soluble protein present in the lens is known to aggregate with aging. A modified form of HGC (HGC(c)) was isolated from cataractous human ocular lens extract and the number of Trp residues that undergo oxidation was determined. The extent of oxidized Trp (N-formyl kynurenine) in HGC due to cataract formation was determined, primarily using fluorescence spectroscopy. The ability of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to retain its antioxidant effect even in the presence of H2O2 was investigated. This was monitored by its ability to prevent the modification of intact Trp residues in HGC(c) isolated from cataractous human eye lens. Significant Trp fluorescence quenching occurs on interaction of the green tea component, EGCG with HGC(c) accompanied by a red shift. Docking studies were employed to substantiate the experimental re…
16456196	Strength, but not muscle mass, is associated with mortality in the health, aging and body composition study cohort.	aging	2006-01-??	BACKGROUND: Although muscle strength and mass are highly correlated, the relationship between direct measures of low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength in association with mortality has not been examined.    METHODS: Total mortality rates were examined in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study in 2292 participants (aged 70-79 years, 51.6% women, and 38.8% black). Knee extension strength was measured with isokinetic dynamometry, grip strength with isometric dynamometry. Thigh muscle area was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, and leg and arm lean soft tissue mass were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Both strength and muscle size were assessed as in gender-specific Cox proportional hazards models, with age, race, comorbidities, smoking status, level of physical activity, fat area by CT or fat mass by DXA, height, and markers of inflammation, including interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha considered as poten…
16671095	A homozygous ZMPSTE24 null mutation in combination with a heterozygous mutation in the LMNA gene causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS): insights into the pathophysiology of HGPS.	aging	2006-06-??	Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disorder normally caused by a spontaneous heterozygous mutation in the LMNA gene that codes for the nuclear lamina protein lamin A. Several enzymes are involved in the processing of its precursor, prelamin A, to the mature lamin A. A functional knockout of one of the enzymes involved in prelamin A processing, the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24, causes an even more severe disorder with early neonatal death described as restrictive dermatopathy (RD). This work describes a HGPS patient with a combined defect of a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the ZMPSTE24 gene and a heterozygous mutation in the LMNA gene that results in a C-terminal elongation of the final lamin A. Whereas the loss of function mutation of ZMPSTE24 normally results in lethal RD, the truncation of LMNA seems to be a salvage alteration alleviating the clinical picture to the HGPS phenotype. The mutations of our patient indicate that farnesylated p…
2018128	Neuroendocrine rhythms and sleep in aging men.	aging	1991-04-??	To delineate the physiological effects of aging on basal levels and temporal patterns of neuroendocrine secretions, the 24-h profiles of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, prolactin, and growth hormone (GH) levels were simultaneously obtained at frequent intervals in eight healthy, active elderly men, age 67-84 yr and in eight young male adults, age 20-27 yr. The study was preceded by an extended period of habituation to laboratory conditions, and sleep was polygraphically recorded. Mean cortisol levels in the elderly were normal, but the amplitude of the circadian rhythm was reduced. Circulating levels of daytime and nighttime levels of both TSH and GH were greatly diminished in old age. In contrast, prolactin and melatonin concentrations were decreased during the nighttime only. The circadian rises of cortisol, TSH, and melatonin occurred 1-1.5 h earlier in elderly subjects, and the distribution of rapid-eye-movement stages during sleep was similarly advanced, su…
24797514	Skeletal muscle mass and muscular function in master swimmers is related to training distance.	aging	2014-10-??	It is unknown whether or not the daily swim training distances of master swimmers (MS) affect the observed changes in skeletal muscle mass (SM) and physical function commonly associated with the aging process. Twenty-two male MS aged 52-82 years were divided into two groups based upon training distance: High MS (>3000 meters swim/session and 4.1 times/week; n=11) and moderate MS (1500-2800 meters swim/session and 3.4 times/week; n=11). Eleven age- and body mass index-matched older (aged 56-80 years) men served as controls (AMC). Subjects who performed resistance training were excluded in this study. Muscle thickness (MTH) was measured by ultrasound at nine sites on the anterior/posterior aspects of the body (forearm, upper arm, trunk, thigh, and lower leg), and from this, total and segmental SM mass values were estimated. Thigh MTH (anterior:posterior mid-thigh, A50:P50) ratio was calculated to assess the site-specific thigh muscle loss. Straight and zigzag walking performance and maxi…
8349625	Preferential formation of C3b-IgG complexes in vitro and in vivo from nascent C3b and naturally occurring anti-band 3 antibodies.	aging	1993-08-15	Naturally occurring anti-band 3 antibodies appear to have tissue homeostatic functions in the clearance of senescent red cells and in eliciting selective phagocytosis of oxidatively stressed red cells by mediating C3b deposition under conditions that favor the alternative complement pathway (Lutz, H. U., Bussolino, F., Flepp, R., Fasler, S., Stammler, P., Kazatchkine, M. D., and Arese, P. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7368-7372). They overcome the notoriously low affinities of naturally occurring antibodies by having affinity for C3 which renders these antibodies preferred targets of nascent C3b. Anti-band 3 antibodies preferentially formed covalently linked C3b-IgG complexes, when C3 was activated randomly by trypsin. IgG depleted of anti-band 3 antibodies had almost lost the ability to form C3b-IgG complexes. Likewise, anti-band 3 antibodies, but not anti-spectrin antibodies, preferentially formed C3b-IgG complexes on oxidatively stressed red cells in the presence of a 10(…
22064469	Progeria Research Day at Brunel University.	aging	????-??-??	Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a severe premature aging syndrome that affects children. These children display characteristics associated with normal aging and die young usually from cardiovascular problems or stroke. Classical HGPS is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the nuclear structural protein lamin A. This mutation leads to a novel version of lamin A that retains a farnesyl group from its processing. This protein is called Progerin and is toxic to cellular function. Pre-lamin A is an immature version of lamin A and also has a farnesylation modification, which is cleaved in the maturation process to create lamin A.
20171368	Stability of doxycycline and chlorhexidine absorbed on root canal dentin.	aging	2010-03-??	INTRODUCTION: The antimicrobial agents chlorhexidine and doxycycline bind to dentin to provide sustained antimicrobial action. This study measured the stability of these chemicals on dentin adjacent to the root canal.    METHODS: Extracted human teeth were instrumented and irrigated with either MTAD or Endo-CHX. After aging at 37 degrees C, the canals were enlarged by 0.3 mm, dentin debris was collected, and compounds were extracted. The amount of doxycyline or chlorhexidine was measured by using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.    RESULTS: After 1 day of aging, the canals contained 3.4+/-1.3 microg doxycycline or 43+/-20 microg chlorhexidine. The half-lives of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were calculated to be 3.0 weeks and 14 weeks, respectively. Groups monitoring decomposition of dilute doxycycline or chlorhexidine in water had half-lives of 5.8 weeks and 40 weeks, respectively. The half-life of the antimicrobials on dentin is suspected to be largely due to dif…
26942871	Age-related alterations in blood and colonic dendritic cell properties.	aging	2016-03-15	BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DC) determine initiation, type and location of immune responses and, in adults, show decreased Toll-like receptors and some increased cytokine levels on ageing. Few studies in children have characterised DC or explored DC-related mechanisms producing age-related immune changes.    RESULTS: The pDC marker BDCA2 (but not CD123) was absent in pre-pubertal children and numbers of pDC decreased with age. Blood and colonic DC were more mature and activated in adults. Decrease in pDC numbers correlated with reduced GM-CSF levels with aging, but increasing IL-4 and IL-8 levels correlated with a more activated DC profile in blood. CXCL16 levels decreased with age.    METHODS: Blood and colonic DC phenotypes were determined in healthy adults and children by flow cytometry and correlated with aging. Blood DC were divided into plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC) while only mDC were identified in colon. Serum cytokine levels were determined by multiplex cytokine assays…
18426968	A short version of the ADAM Questionnaire for androgen deficiency in Chinese men.	aging	2008-04-??	BACKGROUND: A 10-question screening questionnaire for androgen deficiency in aging men (ADAM) was reported in previous white but not Chinese populations. We therefore investigated the validity of a Chinese version of the Saint Louis University ADAM questionnaire to screen for androgen deficiency in Chinese men.    METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Seven hundred ninety-six ambulatory community-based Chinese men, 18-89 years old, were recruited from October 2003 through June 2006. Self-administered Chinese ADAM questionnaire and morning blood samples for serum total testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) levels were collected from all participants. Low serum BT levels (androgen deficiency) were defined as <5th percentile of serum BT levels in young healthy Chinese men (18-29 years).    RESULTS: The Chinese ADAM questionnaire had good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.74) and test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.86; p <.001, two-tai…
16565078	Metabolite of SIR2 reaction modulates TRPM2 ion channel.	aging	2006-05-19	The transient receptor potential melastatin-related channel 2 (TRPM2) is a nonselective cation channel, whose prolonged activation by oxidative and nitrative agents leads to cell death. Here, we show that the drug puromycin selectively targets TRPM2-expressing cells, leading to cell death. Our data suggest that the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2 or sirtuin) family of enzymes mediates this susceptibility to cell death. Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that regulate gene expression, apoptosis, metabolism, and aging. These NAD+-dependent enzymes catalyze a reaction in which the acetyl group from substrate is transferred to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD+ to form deacetylated product, nicotinamide, and the metabolite OAADPr, whose functions remain elusive. Using cell-based assays and RNA interference, we show that puromycin-induced cell death is greatly diminished by nicotinamide (a potent sirtuin inhibitor), and by decreased expression of sirtuins SIRT2 and SIRT3. Furthermore, we de…
18027913	Effect of a single AGE modification on the structure and chaperone activity of human alphaB-crystallin.	aging	2007-12-18	During aging, human lens proteins undergo several post-translational modifications, one of which is glycation. This process leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which accumulate with time possibly leading to the formation of cataract. alphaB-Crystallin, a predominant protein in the lens, is a member of the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) which are a ubiquitous class of molecular chaperones that interact with partially denatured proteins to prevent aggregation. This chaperone function is considered to be vital for the maintenance of lens transparency and in the prevention of cataract. In the present study, we introduced an analog of the advanced glycation end product, OP-lysine, at the 90th position of a mutated human alphaB-crystallin (K90C) by covalent modification of the cysteine residue with N-(2-bromoethyl)-3-oxidopyridinium hydrobromide. The AGE-modified K90C-alphaB-crystallin is termed as K90C-OP. We compared the structural and functional properties …
18000149	HIV-1 infection is associated with an earlier occurrence of a phenotype related to frailty.	aging	2007-11-??	BACKGROUND: Older healthy and HIV-infected adults exhibit physiological similarities. Frailty is a clinical syndrome associated with aging that identifies a subset of older adults at high risk of mortality and other outcomes. We investigated whether HIV infection increases the prevalence of a frailty-related phenotype (FRP) that approximates a clinical definition of frailty.    METHODS: We first defined the FRP and assessed its prevalence among HIV-uninfected men followed in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) between 1994 and 2004. Using repeated measurements logistic regression models, we then assessed the association between FRP and HIV infection before the era of highly active antiretroviral therapies, adjusting for covariates among HIV-uninfected (N = 1905) and incident HIV cases (N = 245).    RESULTS: HIV infection was strongly associated with FRP prevalence. Compared to HIV-uninfected men of similar age, ethnicity and education, HIV-infected men were more likely to have the…
16808998	Differential effects of impaired mitochondrial energy production on the function of mu and delta opioid receptors in neuronal SK-N-SH cells.	aging	2006-08-14	Oxidative stress contributes to changes in neurosensory processing, including pain, that occur during aging and neurodegeneration. The effects of neuronal oxidation on the opioid system are poorly understood. In this in vitro study, oxidative stress was induced by 3-nitroproprionic acid (3-NPA) in opioid-responsive differentiated SK-N-SH cells. Changes in the inhibitory effects of opioid receptor agonists on intracellular cAMP were used as a marker of the function of mu and delta opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively). Cells were treated with morphine and selective MOR and DOR agonists and antagonists to characterize the function of each receptor subtype. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay. Exposure of cells to 3-NPA resulted in an increase in ROS. After 3-NPA exposure, there was a significant attenuation of the inhibitory effect of morphine and DAMGO but no…
19236433	Influence of arterial wave reflection on carotid blood pressure and intima-media thickness in older endurance trained men and women with pre-hypertension.	aging	2009-05-??	Increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) with aging is a significant predictor of mortality. Older endurance trained (ET) individuals have lower carotid artery stiffness but similar carotid IMT when compared to sedentary (SED) age-matched peers. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of arterial wave reflections to carotid hemodynamics and IMT in older ET and SED with pre-hypertension. Subjects consisted of endurance-trained master athletes and age-matched sedentary controls (mean age 67 years). Carotid artery Beta-stiffness index and IMT was assessed with ultrasonography. Carotid pressure and augmented pressure from wave reflections (obtained from pulse contour analysis) was measured with applanation tonometry. Carotid systolic blood pressure (SBP) and IMT were not different between groups (P>0.05). Carotid stiffness was significantly lower in ET versus SED (7.3 +/- 0.8 versus 9.9 +/- 0.6, P<0.05). Augmented pressure was significantly greater in ET versus SED …
26987590	Glaucoma detection with damato multifixation campimetry online.	aging	2016-??-??	PurposeTo evaluate Damato Multifixation Campimetry Online (DMCO), a free-of-charge internet-based visual field test. DMCO exists in three versions: DMCO BASIC, DMCO STANDARD, and DMCO ADVANCED. The main focus was (i) to investigate the sensitivity and the specificity of the existing DMCO versions in the detection of glaucomatous visual field loss and (ii) to define and evaluate algorithms for the interpretation of DMCO results.MethodsThe study design was an evaluation of a diagnostic test and included 97 individuals performing DMCO and white-on-white perimetry. Interpretation algorithms were devised to define abnormality, and these were evaluated using the Glaucoma Staging System as gold standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC (AUC) were calculated.ResultsAUCs from 15 algorithms ranged from 0.79 to 0.90. The most promising algorithm combined results from two successive DMCO STANDARD tests. The sensitivity was highly dependent on the severity of g…
21712379	Implication of Ca2+ in the regulation of replicative life span of budding yeast.	longevity, aging	2011-08-19	In eukaryotic cells, Ca(2+)-triggered signaling pathways are used to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. Calcineurin, a highly conserved Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, plays key roles in the regulation of diverse biological processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. We isolated a mutant of the SIR3 gene, implicated in the regulation of life span, as a suppressor of the Ca(2+) sensitivity of zds1Δ cells in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we investigated a relationship between Ca(2+) signaling and life span in yeast. Here we show that Ca(2+) affected the replicative life span (RLS) of yeast. Increased external and intracellular Ca(2+) levels caused a reduction in their RLS. Consistently, the increase in calcineurin activity by either the zds1 deletion or the constitutively activated calcineurin reduced RLS. Indeed, the shortened RLS of zds1Δ cells was suppressed by the calcineurin deletion. Further, the calcineurin deletion pe…
24443390	Dairy food intake, peripheral bone structure, and muscle mass in elderly ambulatory women.	aging	2014-07-??	Previous studies suggest that dairy intake may be associated with reduced bone and muscle loss with aging, but there are limited data in the very old. We evaluated the association between intake of dairy foods and peripheral bone structure and muscle mass in 564 elderly women aged 80 to 92 (mean 84.7) years, who were participants of the Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome Study/CAIFOS Aged Extension Study (CAIFOS/CARES) cohort and attended the 10-year follow-up. Assessments included dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) by a validated food frequency questionnaire, 15% tibia bone mass, area and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and appendicular bone and skeletal muscle mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Women were categorized according to tertiles of dairy intake: first tertile (≤ 1.5 servings/d), second tertile (1.5 to 2.2 servings/d) and third tertile (≥ 2.2 servings/d). Controlling for confounding factors, pQ…
25769179	Beyond the Mean: Quantile Regression to Explore the Association of Air Pollution with Gene-Specific Methylation in the Normative Aging Study.	aging	2015-08-??	BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been related to mean changes in outcomes, including DNA methylation. However, mean regression analyses may not capture associations that occur primarily in the tails of the outcome distribution.    OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined whether the association between particulate air pollution and DNA methylation differs across quantiles of the methylation distribution. We focused on methylation of candidate genes related to coagulation and inflammation: coagulation factor III (F3), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and toll-like receptor 2 (TRL-2).    METHODS: We measured gene-specific blood DNA methylation repeatedly in 777 elderly men participating in the Normative Aging Study (1999-2010). We fit quantile regressions for longitudinal data to investigate whether the associations of particle number, PM2.5 (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm)black carbon, and PM2.5 mass concentrations (4-week moving average) with DN…
15342244	Crystal structure of an activation intermediate of cathepsin E.	aging	2004-09-17	Cathepsin E is an intracellular, non-lysosomal aspartic protease expressed in a variety of cells and tissues. The protease has proposed physiological roles in antigen presentation by the MHC class II system, in the biogenesis of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin, and in neurodegeneration associated with brain ischemia and aging. Cathepsin E is the only A1 aspartic protease that exists as a homodimer with a disulfide bridge linking the two monomers. Like many other aspartic proteases, it is synthesized as a zymogen which is catalytically inactive towards its natural substrates at neutral pH and which auto-activates in an acidic environment. Here we report the crystal structure of an activation intermediate of human cathepsin E at 2.35A resolution. The overall structure follows the general fold of aspartic proteases of the A1 family, and the intermediate shares many features with the intermediate 2 on the proposed activation pathway of aspartic proteases like pepsin C and cathepsin …
21521956	A system-level approach to improving the care of the older critical care patient.	aging	????-??-??	As the population continues to age, the specialized needs of older adult patients warrant the close attention of the critical care nurse. The combination of critical illness, age-related changes, multiple comorbidities, and the hospital environment can make the diagnosis and management of the older adult's critical illness challenging. The NICHE (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders) program provides a framework to create an aging-sensitive care environment in the critical care setting. The Geriatric Resource Nurse model is the foundation of the program. The goals of NICHE are to support nursing departments to (1) bring evidence-based geriatric practice to the bedside; (2) build patient- and family-centered environments; (3) cultivate healthy and productive practice environments aligned with meeting the specialized needs of older adults and their families ("geriatric nursing practice environments"); and (4) conduct comprehensive measurement of geriatric initiatives.
20079887	Effects of congenital cataract mutation R116H on alphaA-crystallin structure, function and stability.	aging	2010-04-??	alpha-crystallin is a molecular chaperone that maintains the optical properties of the lens and delays the onset scattering caused by aging-related protein aggregation. In this research, we found that the missense mutation R116H resulted in an altered size distribution, impaired packing of the secondary structures and modified quaternary structure with great hydrophobic exposure. The mutant exhibited a substrate-dependent chaperone (aggregation-inhibition) or anti-chaperone (aggregation-promotion) effect. Equilibrium unfolding experiments indicated that the mutation stabilized an aggregation-prone intermediate which was not populated during the unfolding of the wild-type protein. The accumulation of this intermediate greatly promoted the formation of non-native large oligomers or aggregates during unfolding. These results suggested that both the aggregation of the mutant upon stress and co-deposition with the target proteins were likely to be responsible for the onset of cataract.
25873088	PPARD +294C overrepresentation in general and long-lived population in China Bama longevity area and unique relationships between PPARD +294T/C polymorphism and serum lipid profiles.	longevity	2015-03-07	BACKGROUND: The +294T/C polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) gene is associated with hyperlipidemia in several younger populations, but results are still inconsistence across ethnic groups and its possible impact on the lipid profiles of long-lived individuals remains unexploited. Here, we aimed to evaluate the possible correlation between PPARD +294T/C and serum lipid levels in a long-lived population in Bama, a region known for longevity situated in Guangxi, China.    METHODS: Genotyping of PPARD +294T/C polymorphism was conducted in 505 long-lived inhabitants (aged 90 and above, long-lived group, LG) and 468 healthy controls (aged 60-75, non-long-lived group, non-LG) recruited from Bama area.    RESULTS: No difference in allelic and genotypic frequencies was found between the two groups (P>0.05). However, C-allele and C-genotype (TC and CC) were significantly more frequent in the females of non-LG than were LG after sex stratification. CC carr…
20064768	Biomarkers of lead exposure and DNA methylation within retrotransposons.	aging	2010-06-??	BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation within white blood cells may result from cumulative exposure to environmental metals such as lead. Bone lead, a marker of cumulative exposure, may therefore better predict DNA methylation than does blood lead.    OBJECTIVE: In this study we compared associations between lead biomarkers and DNA methylation.    METHODS: We measured global methylation in participants of the Normative Aging Study (all men) who had archived DNA samples. We measured patella and tibia lead levels by K-X-Ray fluorescence and blood lead by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. DNA samples from blood were used to determine global methylation averages within CpG islands of long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) and Alu retrotransposons. A mixed-effects model using repeated measures of Alu or LINE-1 as the dependent variable and blood/bone lead (tibia or patella in separate models) as the primary expo…

OBJECTIVES: To derive lean mass cutpoints based on a less-conservative Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project Weakness cutpoint for grip strength (Weak ) and to assess their agreement with European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and prediction of incident slow walking and mortality.    DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis.    SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.    PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older (287 men, 258 women) with 2 to 10 years of follow-up.    MEASUREMENTS: Weakness was determined according to handgrip strength using a hand dynamometer, appendicular lean mass (ALM) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and walking speed according to 6-m usual pace walk speed. Analyses were performed using classification and regression tree analysis, Cohen's kappa, and Cox models.    RESULTS: Cutpoints derived from Weak for ALM (ALM ) were less than 21.4 kg in men and less than 14.1 kg in women and for ALM adjusted for …
23207484	Very old adults with better memory function have higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios: KOCOA Project.	aging	2013-??-??	We cross-sectionally examined which lipid profiles are associated with better cognitive function among those aged 80 and older, free of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating ≤0.5), functionally independent, and community-dwelling. Our cohort consisted of 193 participants from the "Keys to Optimal Cognitive Aging (KOCOA) Project", a prospective cohort study in Okinawa, Japan. Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratios were associated with higher scores in memory performance after controlling for confounders. Further research is required to clarify the associations among LDL-C levels, TG/HDL-C ratios, and healthy cognitive aging.
29239581	Association Between Nutritional Status and Quality of Life in (Pre) Frail Community-Dwelling Older Persons.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: For developed countries, healthy aging is one of the challenges and the number of healthy life years and especially the quality of life (QoL) are important. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the association between nutritional status and different domains of QoL in (pre)frail community-dwelling elders. DESIGN: Baseline data from persons, who participated in a 12-week nutritional and physical training intervention program, conducted from September 2013 - July 2015. Setting: (Pre)frail community-dwelling elders living in Vienna, Austria. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 83 older persons living at home, 12 men and 71 women (86%) aged 65 to 98 years. Measurements: Structured interviews were conducted at participants’ homes. Mini Nutritional Assessment® long-form (MNA®-LF) was used to investigate the nutritional status. The QoL domains were assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaires. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to eva…
29100249	Longer Telomere Length in Elite Master Sprinters: Relationship to Performance and Body Composition.	longevity, aging	2017-12-??	Emergent evidence suggests that the long-term healthy lifestyle of master athletes may attenuate aging. We compared telomere length (TL) of high-level master sprinters and non-athlete age-matched controls, and analyzed the relationships of TL with performance and body fat. Elite master sprinters (n=11; aged 50.1±9.2yrs) and healthy untrained controls (n=10; aged 45.4±10.9yrs) had blood samples collected for biochemical and biomolecular analyses. Master sprinters had longer TL, lower body fat and BMI, and a better lipid profile than age-matched controls (p<0.05). A large effect size was verified comparing TL between athletes vs. controls (Cohen's d=1.039), with a significant negative correlation between TL and performance decline per decade (r=-0.624, p<0.01) and a positive correlation of TL and actual performance level (r=0.641, p<0.01). In conclusion, TL of elite master sprinters was longer than their untrained peers, and seems to be not only a marker of health status, but also an ind…
23144701	Short sleep duration is associated with shorter telomere length in healthy men: findings from the Whitehall II cohort study.	aging	2012-??-??	BACKGROUND: Shorter telomere length and poor sleep are more prevalent at older ages, but their relationship is uncertain. This study explored associations between sleep duration and telomere length in a sample of healthy middle and early old age people.    METHODS: Participants were 434 men and women aged 63.3 years on average drawn from the Whitehall II cohort study. Sleep duration was measured by self-report.    RESULTS: There was a linear association between sleep duration and leukocyte telomere length in men but not in women (P = 0.035). Men reporting shorter sleep duration had shorter telomeres, independently of age, body mass index, smoking, educational attainment, current employment, cynical hostility scores and depressive symptoms. Telomeres were on average 6% shorter in men sleeping 5 hours or fewer compared with those sleeping more than 7 hours per night.    CONCLUSION: This study adds to the growing literature relating sleep duration with biomarkers of aging, and suggests th…
23249997	Physical inactivity among older Canadian adults.	aging	2014-01-??	BACKGROUND: In spite of the substantial benefits of physical activity for healthy aging, older adults are considered the most physically inactive segment of the Canadian population. This paper examines leisure-time physical inactivity (LTPA) and its correlates among older Canadian adults.    METHODS: We use data from the Canadian Community Health Survey with 45,265 individuals aged 50-79 years. A logistic regression is estimated and separate regressions are performed for males and females.    RESULTS: About 50% of older Canadian adults are physically inactive. Higher odds of physical inactivity are found among current smokers (OR = 1.52, CI = 1.37-1.69), those who binge-drink (OR = 1.24, CI = 1.11-1.39), visible minorities (OR = 1.60, CI = 1.39-1.85), immigrants (OR = 1.13, CI = 1.02-1.25), individuals with high perceived life stress (OR = 1.48, CI = 1.31-1.66). We also find lower odds of physical inactivity among: males (OR = 0.89, CI = 0.83 to 0.96), those with strong social interact…
15979789	The functional COMT polymorphism, Val 158 Met, is associated with logical memory and the personality trait intellect/imagination in a cohort of healthy 79 year olds.	aging	2005-09-02	A polymorphism (Val 158 Met) in the gene for catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) was previously associated with differences in cognitive ability and personality. Here we examine associations between this polymorphism and cognitive ability, cognitive aging, personality and mood in 460 relatively healthy people born in 1921. All had cognitive ability measured at age 11 in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932, and again at age 79. COMT genotype was not associated with childhood IQ. At age 79, COMT genotype was significantly related to differences in verbal declarative memory (scores on the Logical Memory test; p=0.028) and to scores on the personality trait of intellect/imagination (p=0.023), adjusted for sex and childhood IQ. In both cases the Val/Met heterozygotes had higher scores than both homozygous groups. There were trends toward the heterozygotes having higher scores on the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness. The effect of COMT genotype on Logical Memory scor…
25576629	Passive leg movement and nitric oxide-mediated vascular function: the impact of age.	lifespan	2015-03-15	UNLABELLED: In young healthy men, passive leg movement (PLM) elicits a robust nitric oxide (NO)-dependent increase in leg blood flow (LBF), thus providing a novel approach to assess NO-mediated vascular function. While the magnitude of the LBF response to PLM is markedly reduced with age, the role of NO in this attenuated response in the elderly is unknown. Therefore, this study sought to determine the contribution of NO in the PLM-induced LBF with age. Fourteen male subjects (7 young, 24 ± 1 yr; and 7 old, 75 ± 3 yr) underwent PLM with and without NO synthase (NOS) inhibition achieved by intra-arterial infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). LBF was determined second-by-second by Doppler ultrasound, and central hemodynamics were measured by finger photoplethysmography. NOS inhibition blunted the PLM-induced peak increase in LBF in the young (control: 668 ± 106;    L-NMMA: 431 ± 95 Δml/min; P = 0.03) but had no effect in the old (control: 266 ± 98;    L-NMMA: 251 ± 92 Δml/min;…
18399535	Differential effect of oxidative stress on the apoptosis of early and late passage human diploid fibroblasts: implication of heat shock protein 60.	aging	2008-06-??	Since an attenuated response to stress is a characteristic of senescence, a cellular senescence model was used to examine the mechanism of resistance against oxidative stress using human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). With increasing passage, the HDF showed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Late passage HDF were resistant to the lethal effects of oxidative stress, showing less cleavage of pro-caspase-3 and PARP than those of early ones. Since heat shock proteins (Hsps) are not only cytoprotective but also interfere with the apoptotic cascade, the expression patterns of Hsps during cellular senescence were next examined. Oxidative stress induced a decrease in the mitochondrial Hsp60 levels with a concomitant increase in the cytosolic Hsp60 levels in the early passage HDF, but not in late ones. To show that the resistance to oxidative stress is a specific effect of Hsp60, the levels of Hsp60 were knocked down by siRNA. As expected the Hsp60 knock-down cells were more res…
25264102	Redox-sensitive residue in the actin-binding interface of myosin.	aging	2014-10-24	We have examined the chemical and functional reversibility of oxidative modification in myosin. Redox regulation has emerged as a crucial modulator of protein function, with particular relevance to aging. We previously identified a single methionine residue in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) myosin II (M394, near the myosin cardiomyopathy loop in the actin-binding interface) that is functionally sensitive to oxidation. We now show that oxidation of M394 is reversible by methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), restoring actin-activated ATPase activity. Sequence alignment reveals that M394 of Dicty myosin II is a cysteine residue in all human isoforms of skeletal and cardiac myosin. Using Dicty myosin II as a model for site-specific redox sensitivity of this Cys residue, the M394C mutant can be glutathionylated in vitro, resulting in reversible inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity, with effects similar to those of methionine oxidation at this site. This work illustrates the poten…
15491683	Cellular cholesterol enrichment impairs T cell activation and chemotaxis.	aging	2004-09-??	Human aging is associated with an increase in immune cell cholesterol levels, independent of circulating cholesterol levels. The effects of such an increase in membrane cholesterol on lipid raft-associated immune cell function have not been investigated. We sought to examine the effects of in vitro cholesterol loading on two known lipid raft-associated pathways of T cells, namely T cell activation and chemokine stimulation. Using beta-cyclodextrin (BCD) as a vehicle, we were able to rapidly load cholesterol onto human T cell lines and primary peripheral blood T cells without inducing significant cell toxicity. Loading of cholesterol to four-fold that of normal levels induced significant inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization by both alphaCD3 and SDF-1alpha. Cholesterol-loaded peripheral T cells were completely unresponsive to alphaCD3/alphaCD28 stimulation, demonstrating no increase in IL-2, GM1 expression or cell size. T cell polarization of lipid rafts to alphaCD3/alphaCD28…
12759331	How estrogen-specific proteins discriminate estrogens from androgens: a common steroid binding site architecture.	aging	2003-07-??	Steroid hormones play an essential role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, such as growth, metabolism, aging, and hormone-sensitive cancers. Estrogens are no exception and influence growth, differentiation, and functioning of many target tissues, such as the mammary gland, uterus, hypothalamus, pituitary, bone, and liver. Although very similar in structure, each steroid class (i.e., estrogens, androgens, progestins, mineral corticoids, or glucocorticoids) is responsible for distinct physiological processes. To permit specific biological responses for a given steroid class, specific proteins are responsible for steroid bioactivation, action, and inactivation, yet they have low or no affinity to other classes. Estrogens make no exception and possess their own set of related proteins. To understand the molecular basis underlying estrogen recognition from other steroids, structural features of estrogen-specific proteins were analyzed along with their ability to di…
9613959	Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen particles.	aging	1998-04-10	To investigate the factors leading to broadening of the recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) peak in size-exclusion chromatography, the HBsAg particles eluting in different regions of the peak were subjected here to electrophoretic analysis. In nonreduced samples, the 24-kD band corresponding to the S monomer was detected when excessively large amounts of HBsAg were loaded onto the gel. Hence, some monomers are not disulfide-crosslinked in assembled particles. On the other hand, the results of alkylation experiments indicated the presence of free sulfhydryl group(s) in a little portion of freshly-purified HBsAg which was retarded on the size-exclusion chromatographic column and had significant antigenicity. This fraction of HBsAg was shown to be oligomeric and capable of spontaneous assembly into higher-order structures during aging.
27637762	Estimation of spinopelvic muscles' volumes in young asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative analysis.	aging	2017-04-??	PURPOSE: Muscles have been proved to be a major component in postural regulation during pathological evolution or aging. Particularly, spinopelvic muscles are recruited for compensatory mechanisms such as pelvic retroversion, or knee flexion. Change in muscles' volume could, therefore, be a marker of greater postural degradation. Yet, it is difficult to interpret spinopelvic muscular degradation as there are few reported values for young asymptomatic adults to compare to. The objective was to provide such reference values on spinopelvic muscles. A model predicting the muscular volume from reduced set of MRI segmented images was investigated.    METHODS: A total of 23 asymptomatic subjects younger than 24 years old underwent an MRI acquisition from T12 to the knee. Spinopelvic muscles were segmented to obtain an accurate 3D reconstruction, allowing precise computation of muscle's volume. A model computing the volume of muscular groups from less than six MRI segmented slices was investig…
9598488	Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity monitoring in young potent volunteers: reproducibility, evaluation criteria and the effect of sexual intercourse.	aging	1998-06-??	PURPOSE: We studied the reproducibility of nocturnal penile tumescence, rigidity evaluation criteria and the possible effects of sexual intercourse in young, healthy, potent male volunteers.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 12 male medical students 21 to 24 years old into the study. A disorder-free medical history, availability of a sexual partner and normal erectile function were the inclusion criteria. All subjects completed 3 sessions of 3 nights of recording using the RigiScan* device with at least a 3-day interval between recordings. During the last 3-night recording subjects were asked to have sexual intercourse at least once. Analysis of the recordings was focused on the best erectile event as well as on rigidity and tumescence activity units normalized per hour.    RESULTS: The subjects completed 36, 3-night recordings. Of the total of 108 sessions 18 occurred after sexual intercourse. We analyzed 562 erectile episodes. All 3-night recordings included at least 1 episode o…
835600	Interrelations among blood pressure, blood volume, plasma renin activity and urinary catecholamines in benign essential hypertension.	aging	1977-02-??	Interrelations among blood pressure, circulatory volume, plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary catecholamine excretion rates were studied in normal subjects and in patients with benign essential hypertension. Mean plasma or blood volumes related to lean body mass, products of blood volume and the logarithm of PRA, and catecholamine excretion rates did not differ significantly between normal and hypertensive subjects. In both normal subjects and hypertensive patients, blood pressure levels correlated positively with the noradrenaline excretion rate (r = 0.40 and 0.36, respectively; p less than 0.025) but not with adrenaline excretion, circulatory volume or the volume-renin product. The logarithm of PRA correlated inversely with mean blood pressure in normal subjects (r = 0.40; p less than 0.001) but not in hypertensive patients; however, there was no convincing evidence for an inappropriate blood pressure-PRA relationship as a prominent feature in the hypertensive patients. PRA did no…
22525591	Establishing cellular stress response profiles as biomarkers of homeodynamics, health and hormesis.	aging	2013-01-??	Aging is the progressive shrinkage of the homeodynamic space. A crucial component of the homeodynamic space is the stress response (SR), by virtue of which a living system senses disturbance and initiates a series of events for maintenance, repair, adaptation, remodeling and survival. Here we discuss the main intracellular SR pathways in human cells, and argue for the need to define and establish the immediate and delayed stress response profiles (SRP) during aging. Such SRP are required to be established at several age-points, which can be the molecular biomarkers of homeodynamic space and the health status of cells and organisms. SRP can also be useful for testing potential protectors and stimulators of homeodynamics, and can be a standard for monitoring the efficacy of potential pro-survival, health-promoting and aging-modulating conditions, food components and other compounds. An effective strategy, which makes use of SRP for achieving healthy aging and extending the healthspan, is…
12549551	Influence of soil geochemical and physical properties on the sorption and bioaccessibility of chromium(III).	aging	????-??-??	There are numerous Cr(III)-contaminated sites on Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) lands that are awaiting possible clean up and closure. Ingestion of contaminated soil by children is the risk driver that generally motivates the likelihood of site remediation. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple statistical model based on common soil properties to estimate the hioaccessibility of Cr(III)-contaminated soil upon ingestion. Thirty-five uncontaminated soils from seven major soil orders, whose properties were similar to numerous U.S. DoD contaminated sites, were treated with Cr(III) and aged. Statistical analysis revealed that Cr(III) sorption (e.g., adsorption and surface precipitation) by the soils was strongly correlated with the clay content, total inorganic C, pH, and the cation exchange capacity of the soils. Soils with higher quantities of clay, inorganic C (i.e., carbonates), higher pH, and higher cation exchange capacity generally sequestered …
9670867	Lack of an association between insulin-like growth factor-I and body composition, muscle strength, physical performance or self-reported mobility among older persons with functional limitations.	aging	1998-07-??	OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis that decreased growth hormone (GH) secretion contributes to the functional decline that occurs with aging is far from substantiated. There have been few studies addressing the distribution and correlates of IGF-I, an indicator of GH activity, in nonclinical populations. As part of a growth hormone intervention trial, we examined the cross-sectional relations between IGF-I levels and multiple measures of physical function, body composition, and strength in a group of older men and women exhibiting mild to moderate reductions in measured physical performance.    METHODS: Using a variety of advertising techniques, 155 older subjects were recruited from a metropolitan area to participate in a growth hormone and exercise intervention study. At baseline, all subjects had blood drawn for IGF-I and underwent testing of body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength using isokinetic dynamometry, and functional assessment using timed performance measu…
24272790	Water aging reverses residual stresses in hydrophilic dental composites.	aging	2014-02-??	Dental composites develop residual stresses during polymerization due to shrinkage. These stresses may change with time because of relaxation and water sorption in the oral environment. This phenomenon is likely dependent on the composition of the materials, specifically their hydrophilic characteristics, and could result in deleterious stresses on restorative materials and tooth structure. The purpose of this experiment was to use the thin ring-slitting method to compare the residual stress generated within composite materials of varying hydrophilicity when aged in wet and dry conditions after polymerization. Water sorption, solubility, elastic modulus, and residual stresses were measured in 6 commercial composites/cements aged in water and dry conditions. The self-adhesive resin cement showed the highest water sorption and solubility. All composites showed initial residual contraction stresses, which were maintained when aged dry. Residual stresses in 2 of the self-adhesive cements a…
9927731	A new human topoisomerase III that interacts with SGS1 protein.	aging	1999-02-15	Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase III was first identified by studying the hyper-recombination and slow growth phenotypes of yeast mutants. Topoisomerase III interacts with DNA helicase SGS1 and the two proteins are involved in DNA recombination, cellular aging and maintenance of genome stability. A human homolog of topoisomerase III has previously been identified. Here we report the identification of cDNAs and the determination of gene structure for a second human topoisomerase III gene. This novel gene expresses three alternatively spliced transcripts, which encode gene products different in the putative DNA-binding C-termini. The largest gene product of the novel topoisomerase III was expressed and shown to interact with SGS1 protein and partially rescue the slow growth defect of a yeast topoisomerase III mutant. The presence of more than one human topoisomerase III is reminiscent of mammalian topoisomerase II, which has two genetically distinct isoforms with different expression pattern…
24816626	Cognitive inhibition in older high-lethality suicide attempters.	aging	2015-03-??	BACKGROUND: People who attempt suicide often display cognitive impairments, particularly poor cognitive control. Could poor cognitive control contribute to high suicide rates in old age? A component of cognitive control, cognitive inhibition-active suppression of task-irrelevant processing-is very sensitive to aging and has been linked to attempted suicide. We investigated cognitive inhibition in older high-lethality suicide attempters, closely resembling suicide victims, as well as low-lethality attempters, and control groups with and without depression and suicidal ideation.    METHODS: A total of 102 participants aged 60 years and older (17 psychiatrically healthy control subjects, 38 depressed control subjects, 16 suicide ideators, 14 low-lethality suicide attempters, and 17 high-lethality suicide attempters) underwent comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessments. They completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Test, a validated modification of…
15282207	In vivo function of the conserved non-catalytic domain of Werner syndrome helicase in DNA replication.	aging	2004-10-01	Werner syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by genomic instability, elevated recombination and replication defects. The WRN gene encodes a RecQ helicase whose function(s) in cellular DNA metabolism is not well understood. To investigate the role of WRN in replication, we examined its ability to rescue cellular phenotypes of a yeast dna2 mutant defective in a helicase-endonuclease that participates with flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) in Okazaki fragment processing. Genetic complementation studies indicate that human WRN rescues dna2-1 mutant phenotypes of growth, cell cycle arrest and sensitivity to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea or DNA damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate. A conserved non-catalytic C-terminal domain of WRN was sufficient for genetic rescue of dna2-1 mutant phenotypes. WRN and yeast FEN-1 were reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of transformed dna2-1 cells. A physical interaction between yeast FEN-1 and WRN is demonstrated by yeast FEN-1 affin…
25416785	Parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1/Park7 is a major protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated cysteine, arginine, and lysine residues.	aging	2015-01-16	Glycation is an inevitable nonenzymatic covalent reaction between proteins and endogenous reducing sugars or dicarbonyls (methylglyoxal, glyoxal) that results in protein inactivation. DJ-1 was reported to be a multifunctional oxidative stress response protein with poorly defined function. Here, we show that human DJ-1 is a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated amino acids and proteins by acting on early glycation intermediates and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. DJ-1 deglycates cysteines, arginines, and lysines (the three major glycated amino acids) of serum albumin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and aspartate aminotransferase and thus reactivates these proteins. DJ-1 prevented protein glycation in an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the DJ-1 homolog YajL and restored cell viability in glucose-containing media. These results suggest that DJ-1-associated Parkinsonism results from excessive protein …
27843692	Age-related differences in brain network activation and co-activation during multiple object tracking.	aging	2016-??-??	INTRODUCTION: Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a powerful paradigm for measuring sustained attention. Although previous fMRI studies have delineated the brain activation patterns associated with tracking and documented reduced tracking performance in aging, age-related effects on brain activation during MOT have not been characterized. In particular, it is unclear if the task-related activation of different brain networks is correlated, and also if this coordination between activations within brain networks shows differential effects of age.    METHODS: We obtained fMRI data during MOT at two load conditions from a group of younger ( = 25, mean age = 24.4 ± 5.1 years) and older ( = 21, mean age = 64.7 ± 7.4 years) healthy adults. Using a combination of voxel-wise and independent component analysis, we investigated age-related differences in the brain network activation. In order to explore to which degree activation of the various brain networks reflect unique and common mechanisms, w…
8317997	Identification and characterization of glycanated and non-glycanated forms of biglycan and decorin in the human intervertebral disc.	aging	1993-06-15	Immunological studies revealed the presence of several different forms of biglycan and decorin in human intervertebral-disc tissues (annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus and cartilage end-plate). In the young intervertebral disc, glycosaminoglycan-containing (glycanated) forms of both biglycan and decorin represented a greater proportion of the total proteoglycan population present in extracts of annulus fibrosus and cartilage end-plate compared with extracts of nucleus pulposus, in which they were barely detectable. In older discs the glycanated forms of biglycan and decorin represented only a small proportion of the total proteoglycan present. Immunochemical analyses with an antibody to chondroitin/dermatan sulphate isomers indicated differences in the glycosaminoglycans substituted on glycanated forms of small proteoglycans found in different disc tissues. Dermatan sulphate was the predominant glycosaminoglycan present on biglycan and decorin in annulus fibrosus extracts, whereas chon…
15161201	Antioxidant and cellular activities of anthocyanins and their corresponding vitisins A--studies in platelets, monocytes, and human endothelial cells.	aging	2004-06-02	During red wine aging, there is a loss of anthocyanins and the formation of various other pigments, so-called vitisins A, which are formed through the chemical interaction of the original anthocyanins with pyruvic acid. The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant activities of the most abundant anthocyanins present in red wine (glycosides of delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin) and their corresponding vitisins A. Anthocyanins exhibited a higher iron reducing as well as 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) and peroxyl radical scavenging activity than their corresponding vitisins A. Delphinidin showed the highest antioxidant effect of the tested compounds in all of the assays used. Furthermore, we studied the effect of anthocyanins and vitisins A on platelet aggregation and monocyte and endothelial function. Anthocyanins and vitisins did not affect nitric oxide production and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion in lipopolysaccharide plus i…
15833273	Irreversible cellular senescence induced by prolonged exposure to H2O2 involves DNA-damage-and-repair genes and telomere shortening.	aging	2005-07-??	H2O2 has been the most commonly used inducer for stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), which shares features of replicative senescence. However, there is still uncertainty whether SIPS and replicative senescence differ or utilize different pathways. 'Young' human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), treated with prolonged low doses of hydrogen peroxide, led to irreversible cellular senescence. Cells exhibited senescent-morphological features, irreversible G1 cell cycle arrest and irreversible senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positivity. The appearance of these cellular senescence markers was accompanied by significant increases of p21, gadd45 expression and p53 binding activity, as well as a significant decline in DNA repair capability and accelerated telomere shortening. Our results suggest that multiple pathways might be involved in oxidative SIPS, including genes related to DNA-damage-and-repair and telomere shortening, and that SIPS shares the same mechanisms with replicative …
27776987	Endocrinology of Aging From a Muscle Function Point of View: Results From the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging.	aging	2017-03-01	INTRODUCTION: Aging is a process that involves a reduction in muscle strength and anabolic hormone concentrations, which impacts significantly on health.    AIM: To study the hormone/total strength (H/TS) ratio as a proxy of anabolic insensitivity status in elders, and its relationship with disability, hospitalization, and mortality risk.    DESIGN: A total of 1462 persons aged ≥65 years from the Toledo Study of Healthy Aging participated in this study. Serum concentrations of insulin like growth factor 1, total and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 17β-estradiol were measured. Total maximal voluntary isometric strength was obtained (handgrip, shoulder, hip, and knee) using standardized techniques and equipment. Physical activity was recorded by physical activity scale for the elderly questionnaire. Associations of the H/TS ratio with hospitalization and mortality were assessed using logistic regression models, and participants stratified in…
10536652	Elevated salivary cortisol in the evening in healthy elderly men and women: correlation with bone mineral density.	aging	1999-09-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women. Loss of BMD can also be caused by hypercortisolemia in men or women at any age. This study measured salivary cortisol at 2300 h and 0700 h as indices of cortisol secretory activity in 228 elderly, community-dwelling subjects. Salivary cortisol results were correlated with BMD. We hypothesized that salivary cortisol is elevated at 2300 h in elderly people, and that salivary cortisol will correlate negatively with BMD.    METHODS: Saliva was sampled at 2300 h (nadir in circadian rhythm) and 0700 h (peak in circadian rhythm) in 130 men (70.7 +/- 0.4 years old) and 98 women (70.0 +/- 0.4 years old); approximately half of the women were receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). BMD was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.    RESULTS: Salivary cortisol at 2300 h was significantly elevated in men (2.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L) and women (2.1 +/- 0.1 nmol/L) as compared to 73 younger controls (1.2 +/-…
18701258	Mechanisms of carvacrol-induced expression of type I collagen gene.	aging	2008-12-??	BACKGROUND: Skin aging is accompanied by wrinkle formation and appears to be principally related to decreases in the levels of type I collagen, the primary component of the dermal layer of skin.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of carvacrol on collagen gene expression and its mechanisms of action.    METHODS: To elucidate the effect of carvacrol on collagen expression and its mechanism, several experiments were performed in human dermal fibroblasts. Collagen production, small interference RNA, Ca(2+) mobilization, COL1A2/AP-1 luciferase reporter assays and Western blots for proteins that are involved in collagen gene expression were used in this study.    RESULTS: Carvacrol activated both the human COL1A2 promoter activity and the synthesis of human type I procollagen. Additionally, we attempted to characterize the mechanism of action of carvacrol in type I procollagen synthesis. In a human COL1A2 promoter luciferase assay, the small interference RNA for SP-1 did not reduce the …
26032253	Amino acids of importance for the antioxidant activity of human serum albumin as revealed by recombinant mutants and genetic variants.	aging	2015-08-01	AIMS: To determine molecular information about the antioxidant properties of human serum albumin, which is an important extracellular antioxidant. To obtain this information, we studied this function of the protein by using H2O2 as the representative reactive oxygen species and two recombinant mutants and ten genetic variants with single-residue mutations.    MAIN METHODS: The antioxidant capabilities of the isoforms were registered as their ability to diminish the H2O2-induced conversion of dihydrorhodamine 123 to rhodamine 123, which can emit fluorescence at 536 nm. Structural properties were examined by circular dichroism and SDS-PAGE.    KEY FINDINGS: Cysteine residues are important for the antioxidant function, but their effect depends on their position in the protein, with Cys410 > Cys34 ~ Cys169 (when not involved in forming a disulfide bond). Likewise, the substitution of a glutamic acid at position 122 or 541, but not at 240 or 560, improves the antioxidant effect, perhaps by …
22586215	Biomarkers of mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle of healthy young human subjects.	aging	2012-07-15	Skeletal muscle mitochondrial content varies extensively between human subjects. Biochemical measures of mitochondrial proteins, enzyme activities and lipids are often used as markers of mitochondrial content and muscle oxidative capacity (OXPHOS). The purpose of this study was to determine how closely associated these commonly used biochemical measures are to muscle mitochondrial content and OXPHOS. Sixteen young healthy male subjects were recruited for this study. Subjects completed a graded exercise test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis. Mitochondrial content was determined using transmission electron microscopy imaging and OXPHOS was determined as the maximal coupled respiration in permeabilized fibres. Biomarkers of interest were citrate synthase (CS) activity, cardiolipin content, mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA), complex I–V protein content, and complex I–IV activity. Spearman correlation coefficient tests …
19753652	Coenzyme Q10 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death and enhances the synthesis of basement membrane components in dermal and epidermal cells.	aging	????-??-??	Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which has both energizing and anti-oxidative effects, is also reported to have antiaging action, e.g., reducing the area of facial wrinkles. However, the mechanism of its anti-aging activity is not fully established. Here, we examined the effect of CoQ10 on human dermal and epidermal cells. CoQ10 promoted proliferation of fibroblasts but not keratinocytes. It also accelerated production of basement membrane components, i.e., laminin 332 and type IV and VII collagens, in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively; however, it had no effect on type I collagen production in fibroblasts. CoQ10 also showed protective effects against cell death induced by several reactive oxygen species in keratinocytes, but only when its cellular absorption was enhanced by pretreatment of the cells with highly CoQ10-loaded serum. These results suggest that protection of epidermis against oxidative stress and enhancement of production of epidermal basement membrane components may be in…
10726917	Lack of effect of sodium nitroprusside on insulin-mediated blood flow and glucose disposal in the elderly.	aging	2000-03-??	Insulin increases skeletal muscle blood flow in healthy young subjects by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. Impairment of this mechanism may contribute to the insulin resistance of normal aging, a state characterized by reduced endothelial production of NO, an attenuated effect of insulin on skeletal muscle blood flow, and resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU). We tested the hypothesis that the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) would augment insulin-mediated vasodilation and thus increase IMGU in healthy elderly subjects. Experiments were performed with young (n = 9; age, 25 +/- 1 years; body mass index [BMI], 24 +/- 1 kg/m2) and old (n = 10; age, 78 +/- 2 years; BMI, 25 +/- 1 kg/m2) healthy subjects. Each group underwent two studies in random order. In one study (control), insulin was infused using the euglycemic clamp protocol for 240 minutes at a rate of 40 mU/m2/min (young) and 34 mU/m2/min (old). In the other study (SNP), SNP was coinfused with insulin from…
16911562	p16INK4A is a robust in vivo biomarker of cellular aging in human skin.	aging	2006-10-??	The cell-cycle regulating gene, p16INK4A, encoding an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, is considered to play an important role in cellular aging and in premature senescence. Although there is an age-dependent increase of p16INK4A expression in human fibroblast senescence in vitro, no data are available regarding the age dependency of p16INK4A in vivo. To determine whether p16INK4A expression in human skin correlates with donor age, p16INK4A expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry as well as the expression of the p16INK4A repressor BMI1. Samples from the age groups 0-20, 21-70, and 71-95 years were selected from a bank of healthy human skin. We show that the number of p16INK4A positive cells is significantly higher in elderly individuals compared to the younger age groups. The number of p16INK4A positive cells was found to be increased in both epidermis and dermis, compartments with strictly different proliferative activities. BMI1 gene expression was significantly…
18250362	Effect of telmisartan on nitric oxide--asymmetrical dimethylarginine system: role of angiotensin II type 1 receptor gamma and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma signaling during endothelial aging.	aging	2008-03-??	Telmisartan, in addition to blocking angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) signaling that interferes with nitric oxide (NO) system. Because aging of endothelial cells (ECs) is hallmarked by a reduction in NO synthesis, we hypothesized that telmisartan increases NO formation by regulated asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)-system through blocking AT(1)R and activating PPARgamma signaling. To test this hypothesis, ECs were cultured with telmisartan, eprosartan, Ang II, and GW9662 (PPARgamma antagonist) until the twelfth passage. During the process of aging, PPARgamma protein expression decreased significantly, whereas the expression of AT(1)R increased. Telmisartan reversed these effects and dose-dependently decreased reactive oxygen species and 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) formation. This effect was associated with an upregulated activity and protein expr…
12657069	Prevalence and correlates of anxiety symptoms in well-functioning older adults: findings from the health aging and body composition study.	aging	2003-04-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and correlates of anxiety symptoms in the absence of depression, in older black and white people.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.    SETTING: Baseline assessment of a biracial cohort of community-resident well-functioning men and women aged 70 to 79 participating in the Health Aging and Body Composition study.    PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand forty-one participants (mean age 74, 52% women, 58% white).    MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked about three major anxiety symptoms (feeling fearful, tense/keyed-up, or shaky/nervous) derived from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Participants were considered to have anxiety symptoms if they reported feeling at least two anxiety symptoms "a little" or one symptom "quite a bit" in the past week. Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic, psychosocial, and health-related correlates of anxiety symptoms.    RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms occurred in 15% of older people without depression and 43% …
25529659	Chemical, chromatic, and sensory attributes of 6 red wines produced with prefermentative cold soak.	aging	2015-05-01	Six red grape cultivars, Barbera D'Asti, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Syrah, were produced with or without prefermentative cold soak (CS). Cold soak had no effect on the basic chemical composition of the wines. At pressing, CS wines were more saturated and with a higher red component than control wines. After 1 year of bottle aging, CS wines retained 22% more anthocyanins than control wines, but tannins and total phenolics remained unaffected. Both saturation and the red component of colour were slightly higher in CS wines. From a sensory standpoint, CS only enhanced colour intensity in Barbera D'Asti and Cabernet Sauvignon wines, whereas it diminished colour intensity in Pinot Noir. Cold soak had no effect on perceived aroma, bitterness, astringency, and body of the wines. Principal Component Analysis suggested that the outcome of CS is contingent upon the specific cultivar to which the CS technique is applied.
15783089	Nucleoli in human early erythroblasts (K2, K1, K1/2 cells).	aging	2005-??-??	Human early erythroid precursors classified according to the nuclear size were studied to provide information on nucleoli in these cells using simple cytochemical procedures for demonstration of RNA and proteins of silver-stained nucleolar organizers. K2 cells with nuclear diameter larger than 13 microm and K1 cells with nuclear diameter larger than 9 microm corresponding to proerythroblasts and macroblasts (large basophilic erythroblasts) mostly possessed large irregularly shaped nucleoli with multiple fibrillar centres representing "active nucleoli". K1/2 cells with nuclear diameter smaller than 9 microm corresponding to small basophilic erythroblasts were usually characterized by the presence of micronucleoli representing "inactive nucleolar types". On the other hand, a few K1/2 cells contained large nucleoli with multiple fibrillar centres similar to those present in K2 cells and thus appeared as "microproerythroblasts". The nucleolar asynchrony expressed by the presence of large i…
20486859	Acrylic bone cements: influence of time and environment on physical properties.	aging	2010-06-??	Acrylic bone cements are in extensive use in joint replacement surgery. They are weight bearing and load transferring in the bone-cement-prosthesis complex and therefore, inter alia, their mechanical properties are deemed to be crucial for the overall outcome. In spite of adequate preclinical test results according to the current specifications (ISO, ASTM), cements with inferior clinical results have appeared on the market. The aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to predict the long term clinical performance of acrylic bone cement on the basis of mechanical in vitro testing. We performed in vitro quasistatic testing of cement after aging in different media and at different temperatures for up to 5 years. Dynamic creep testing and testing of retrieved cement were also performed. Testing under dry conditions, as required in current standards, always gave higher values for mechanical properties than did storage and testing under more physiological conditions. We co…
17884137	Effects of multivitamin supplementation on DNA damage in lymphocytes from elderly volunteers.	aging	2007-10-??	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a mixture of vitamins and minerals on oxidative DNA damage and the resistance of DNA to H(2)O(2)-induced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes from 80 elderly volunteers ex vivo by means of Comet assay. The intervention with vitamin complex decreased significantly the levels of DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that the vitamin complex was able to decrease H(2)O(2)-induced DNA breakage. Our data suggest that the consumption of some vitamins may reduce the effects of oxidative DNA damage and may be useful for attaining healthy aging.
17905924	Candida albicans Sun41p, a putative glycosidase, is involved in morphogenesis, cell wall biogenesis, and biofilm formation.	aging	2007-11-??	The SUN gene family has been defined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comprises a fungus-specific family of proteins which show high similarity in their C-terminal domains. Genes of this family are involved in different cellular processes, like DNA replication, aging, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cytokinesis. In Candida albicans the SUN family comprises two genes, SUN41 and SIM1. We demonstrate that C. albicans mutants lacking SUN41 show similar defects as found for S. cerevisiae, including defects in cytokinesis. In addition, the SUN41 mutant showed a higher sensitivity towards the cell wall-disturbing agent Congo red, whereas no difference was observed in the presence of calcofluor white. Compared to the wild type, SUN41 deletion strains exhibited a defect in biofilm formation, a reduced adherence on a Caco-2 cell monolayer, and were unable to form hyphae on solid medium under the conditions tested. Interestingly, Sun41p was found to be secreted in the medium of cells growing as blas…
15791002	Expression of the Leo1-like domain of replicative senescence down-regulated Leo1-like (RDL) protein promotes senescence of 2BS fibroblasts.	aging	2005-04-??	Replicative senescence is thought to relate to aging in vivo and tumor suppression. In this report, we isolated a gene and designated it as RDL (replicative senescence down-regulated Leo1-like gene). RDL's expression decreased upon replicative senescence of human diploid 2BS fibroblasts. Overexpression of RDL slightly delayed 2BS fibroblast senescence, whereas suppression of RDL expression imposed no obvious effects on senescence. However, introduction of cDNA fragment encoding the Leo1-like domain of RDLp (Leo) alone shortened the replicative life span of 2BS fibroblasts and promoted several senescent features; the introduction of truncated RDL cDNA fragment resulting from deletion of Leo (RDL-Leo-) significantly prolonged 2BS life span and caused a noticeable delay of these senescent features. We demonstrated that introduction of Leo obviously increased the expression of p16INK4a, p21WAF1, and PTEN, whereas introduction of RDL-Leo- distinctly decreased p16INK4a expression. Taken toge…
25651555	Undermet needs for assistance in personal activities of daily living among community-dwelling oldest old in China from 2005 to 2008.	longevity	2015-02-??	Based on the 2005 and 2008 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, this study examined the prevalence of undermet needs for assistance in personal activities of daily living (ADL) and its associated risk factors among the oldest old aged 80+. Multilevel multinomial logistic modeling was used to analyze the risk factors and changes of undermet needs over time. The results show that the prevalence of slightly undermet needs decreased in urban China from 2005 to 2008. However, the prevalence of undermet needs remained high; 50% or more for both rural and urban residents. Compared to 2005, the likelihood of having slightly undermet needs in 2008 significantly decreased by 28% among rural residents and 22% among urban residents. The common risk factors of undermet needs among rural and urban residents included financial dependence, living alone, having unwilling caregivers, more ADL disabilities, and having poor self-rated health.
23578831	Modulation of cellular senescence in fibroblasts and dermal papillae cells in vitro.	aging	????-??-??	A hexapeptide (Hexapeptide-11) of structure Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro (FVAPFP) originally isolated from yeast extracts and later synthesized by solid state synthesis to high purity has demonstrated an ability to influence the onset of senescence in intrinsically aged fibroblasts, extrinsically aged fibroblasts, and extrinsically aged dermal papillae cells in vitro. The mechanism of senescence control is believed to be related to the peptide's ability to reversibly downregulate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53 protein expression. The importance of p53 as the gatekeeping protein for monitoring cellular DNA damage is strategic for maintaining cellular health. ATM activates p53 by direct phosphorylation, causing cells to move into senescence which effectively moves them out of reproductive processes. Technologies that can influence ATM and p53 expression may offer unique benefits for controlling cellular senescence and effectively delaying cellular aging processes. The influence o…
1483779	Pre-acclimatization to high altitude using exercise with normobaric hypoxic gas mixtures.	aging	1992-10-??	Pre-acclimatization was conducted using a new method elaborated in our laboratory, combining high intensity exercise while breathing hypoxia normobaric gas mixtures. The training consisted in a daily training during three weeks, 6 days a week, two hours a day, on bicycle ergometer. Eighteen subjects aging 22.2 +/- 1.4 years (11 males, 7 females) were matched in two similar groups: one group trained in normoxic conditions (NG) while the other group (HG) trained with a progressive decrease of the fraction of inspired oxygen (from 12.2% to 10.0%). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured before and after the protocol period in both hypoxic (VO2max H, FIO2 = 10.4%) and normoxic (VO2max N) conditions, for the 2 groups. Training induced a similar O2max N increase in the two groups. The ratio VO2max H/VO2max N was calculated. As expected, in NG group, this ratio decreased significantly (from 63.9 +/- 4.3 to 57.5 +/- 3.1%, p < 0.01) after the training period compared to the initial value, …
16951143	p53 is preferentially recruited to the promoters of growth arrest genes p21 and GADD45 during replicative senescence of normal human fibroblasts.	aging	2006-09-01	Replicative senescence is the terminal growth arrest that most normal human cells enter into after a fixed number of divisions in vitro, limiting the proliferative potential of a cell and preventing genomic instability caused by critically short telomeres. Thus, senescence presents a tumor-suppressive mechanism and a barrier to tumor formation. However, senescent cells are inherently resistant to apoptosis and, as they accumulate in aging tissues, may contribute to organ dysfunction and promote tumor progression as part of the stromal environment. Replicative life span in normal human cells can be extended by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 or its direct target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, suggesting a direct role for this pathway in senescence. However, p53 recruitment to promoters of target genes during replicative senescence has not been shown in live cells. In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine that p53 preferentially occupie…
12821715	Aging affects two modes of nanoleakage expression in bonded dentin.	aging	2003-07-??	Water sorption into resin-dentin interfaces precedes hydrolytic degradation. We hypothesized that these processes are morphologically manifested by the uptake of ammoniacal silver nitrate, which is thought to trace hydrophilic domains and water-filled channels within matrices. Water sorption is thought to be nonuniform and can be traced by the use of silver nitrate. Human teeth bonded with an experimental filled-adhesive were aged in artificial saliva (experimental) or non-aqueous mineral oil (control). Specimens retrieved for up to a 12-month period were immersed in 50 wt% ammoniacal silver nitrate and examined by transmission electron microscopy for identification of the changes in their silver uptake. Reticular silver deposits initially identified within the bulk of hybrid layers in the experimental group were gradually reduced over time, but were subsequently replaced by similar deposits that were located along the hybrid layer-adhesive interface. Silver uptake in water-binding dom…
17914773	Gas-phase spectroscopy of protonated 3-OH kynurenine and argpyrimidine. comparison of experimental results to theoretical modeling.	aging	2007-10-25	The aging process of the human lens is associated with accumulation of chromophores and fluorophores that impair visual function. In the present study, we examined the photodissociation of 3-OH-kynurenine and argpyrimidine. Furthermore, absorption spectra obtained in gas phase using an electrostatic ion storage ring were studied as gas phase absorption have been shown to be more similar to the in vivo condition than absorption spectra obtained in the liquid phase. Experimental results were compared to theoretical modeling using the multistate, multireference perturbation theory approach combined with advanced molecular modeling tools to account for the solvent effects and to provide direct support for band assignments. Absorption maxima were determined both experimentally and theoretically and significant differences between the two chromophores were found. In particular, 3-OH-kynurenine demonstrated a blue-shift of more than 130 nm in the aqueous phase compared to the gas-phase due to…
18815206	Human vastus lateralis and soleus muscles display divergent cellular contractile properties.	aging	2008-11-??	The purpose of this study was to investigate potential differences in single-fiber contractile physiology of fibers with the same myosin heavy chain isoform (MHC I and MHC IIa) originating from different muscles. Vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus biopsies were obtained from 27 recreationally active females (31 +/- 1 yr, 59 +/- 1 kg). A total of 943 single fibers (MHC I = 562; MHC IIa = 301) were isolated and examined for diameter, peak tension (Po), shortening velocity (Vo), and power. The soleus had larger (P < 0.05) fibers (MHC I +18%; MHC IIa +19%), higher MHC I Vo (+13%), and higher MHC I Po (+18%) compared with fibers from the VL. In contrast, fibers from the VL had higher (P < 0.05) specific tension (MHC I +18%; MHC IIa +20%), and MHC I normalized power (+25%) compared with the soleus. There was a trend for MHC IIa soleus fibers to have higher Vo [MHC IIa +13% (P = 0.058)], whereas VL MHC IIa fibers showed a trend for higher normalized power compared with soleus fibers [MHC IIa +3…
9466700	Suppression of apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL promotes survival and mutagenesis after oxidative damage.	aging	1997-10-??	Apoptosis is the physiological process by which unwanted cells in an organism are killed. Bcl-2, a membrane-bound cytoplasmic protein, and its close relative Bcl-xL, are both effective inhibitors of apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli in many different cell types. In a previous study, we reported that suppression of apoptosis by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, markedly elevates the levels of radiation-induced mutations at the specific locus thymidine kinase. We investigated the effect of the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overproduction on hydrogen peroxide-induced mutagenesis. Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in biological processes such as mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. Overexpression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL enhances oxidative stress mutagenesis in cells with wild type p53 as well as with mutated p53 protein. These results support the hypothesis that apoptosis plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity by selectively eliminating highly mutated cells from the population.
2309052	Human red cell age, oxygen affinity and oxygen transport.	aging	1990-01-??	The [2,3-DPG]/[Hb] ratio and the P50 were found to be lower in the 10% denser (old) than in the 10% lighter (young) red blood cell (RBC) fractions (0.57 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.13 and 23.02 +/- 0.85 vs 27.47 +/- 1.05 Torr, respectively, mean +/- SD, P less than 0.0005 for both, n = 6). The RBC aging processes appear thus to affect the RBC oxygen affinity. However, the [2,3-DPG] changes do not fully explain the drop of not fully explain the drop of P50 as measured at constant [H+], [CO2] and [HbCO]. It is therefore postulated that an additional factor is involved in the regulation of the oxygen affinity in the ageing RBC. The RBC density in 59 normal individuals matched for age (infants, adult, and aged) and for sex was found to be younger in adult females than in all other groups (P less than 0.0005), including an age-matched group of pregnant women. Correspondingly, the [2,3-DPG]/[Hb] ratio and the P50 are higher in adult females than in adult males (0.92 +/- 0.10 vs 0.82 +/- 0.09, P l…
19901656	Immunologic function in the elderly after injury--the neutrophil and innate immunity.	aging	2009-11-??	BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with a decline in immune function. This may contribute to decreased ability of an elderly patient to mount an appropriate innate inflammatory response when injured. This study examined elderly trauma patients to determine whether there was a difference in neutrophil response to injury when compared with controls.    METHODS: This prospective, observational, cohort study compared neutrophil function in 24 injured elderly (older than 65 years) patients admitted to our trauma center to control groups of noninjured individuals (11 elderly and 17 young). Blood samples were also taken from the injured elderly group within 48 hours of trauma and subsequently at two periods during their hospital stay. A single blood sample was obtained from the noninjured control groups. Neutrophils were analyzed for CD18 expression, stimulated oxidative burst, apoptosis, and IL-10. Results were compared using one-way analysis of variance (alpha 0.05). This study was approved by…
22417331	Analytical and sensory characterization of the aroma of "Langhe D.O.C. Nebbiolo" wines: influence of the prefermentative cold maceration with dry ice.	aging	2011-05-??	The present work concerns the determination of the volatile compounds, as well as the description of the olfactory characteristics, of "Langhe DOC Nebbiolo" wines produced through the prefermentative cold maceration with dry ice, on full scale (30 quintals) in private cellars. The free volatile compounds and those obtained by enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of the glycosilated precursors were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among free volatile compounds, a loss of alcohols with 6 carbon atoms in the cryo-macerated trials was observed. The cryo-maceration technique, when correctly applied, increased the floral and fruity notes (blackberry, cherry, and plum). This increase is related to the extraction of polyphenolic compounds (maceration effect), but no volatile compounds, neither in free form, nor produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosilated precursors, can discriminate the wines according to their content of polyphenols. Only some compounds produced by chem…
27229617	Increased expression of SIRT2 is a novel marker of cellular senescence and is dependent on wild type p53 status.	longevity, aging	2016-??-17	Sirtuins (SIRT) belonging to the NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase III class of enzymes have emerged as master regulators of metabolism and longevity. However, their role in prevention of organismal aging and cellular senescence still remains controversial. In the present study, we now report upregulation of SIRT2 as a specific feature associated with stress induced premature senescence but not with either quiescence or cell death. Additionally, increase in SIRT2 expression was noted in different types of senescent conditions such as replicative and oncogene induced senescence using multiple cell lines. Induction of SIRT2 expression during senescence was dependent on p53 status as depletion of p53 by shRNA prevented its accumulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of p53 binding sites on the SIRT2 promoter suggesting its regulation by p53, which was also corroborated by the SEAP reporter assay. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT2 had no effect on stress induced p…
18199471	Telomere and adaptive immunity.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	The adaptive immune response relies on the ability of lymphocytes to undergo periodic massive expansion. It is an enigma how lymphocytes are able to undergo this seemingly unlimited number of cell divisions. Telomeres and telomerase play a critical role in regulation of the replicative lifespan of cells, providing a potential mechanism which lymphocytes may employ. Here I will review the recent progress of the role of telomeres and telomerase in lymphocyte differentiation, function, and aging.
15514410	A longitudinal study of hippocampal volume, cortisol levels, and cognition in older depressed subjects.	aging	2004-11-??	OBJECTIVE: This study determined whether cognitive impairments and structural brain changes in older depressed subjects, especially in the hippocampus, are related to hypercortisolemia.    METHOD: Sixty-one depressed subjects over age 60 who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and 40 healthy comparison subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological testing, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping, and salivary cortisol assessment (over 3 days) with follow-up 6 months later. Hippocampal volume was measured by manual segmentation that was blind to diagnosis. Average area under the curve for salivary cortisol over the 3 days was calculated. Cognitive function was assessed by using a combined memory z score.    RESULTS: Depressed subjects showed multiple impairments in attention, working memory, visual memory, verbal memory, new learning, and executive function in relation to comparison subjects. They had hypercortisolemia (53% increase in area under the curve…
16879819	Nutritional antioxidants and age-related cataract and maculopathy.	aging	2007-02-??	Loss of vision is the second greatest, next to death, fear among the elderly. Age-related cataract (ARC) and maculopathy (ARM) are two major causes of blindness worldwide. There are several important reasons to study relationships between risk for ARC/ARM and nutrition: (1) because it is likely that the same nutritional practices that are associated with prolonged eye function will also be associated with delayed age-related compromises to other organs, and perhaps, aging in general, (2) surgical resources are insufficient to provide economic and safe surgeries for cataract and do not provide a cure for ARM, and (3) there will be considerable financial savings and improvements in quality of life if health rather than old age is extended, particularly given the rapidly growing elderly segment of our population. It is clear that oxidative stress is associated with compromises to the lens and retina. Recent literature indicates that antioxidants may ameliorate the risk for ARC and ARM. Gi…
6275215	Application of chemiluminescent probes in investigating lysosomal sensitivity to superoxide versus suspected radical scavengers.	aging	1981-11-??	The role of the superoxide anion radical (O2(-).) relative to catalytic/inhibitory substances in lysosomes is poorly understood. Cultured glial cells sequestered endocytotically two probes that were site-specific to the lysosome vacuome and sensitive to radical activities. The Sepharose-4B-isoluminol probe emitted chemiluminescent light in proportion to externally injected O2(-). and was inhibited or catalysed by various radical scavengers, transition metals and other substances which may affect lysosomal metabolism and lipofuscin formation. We conclude that lysosomal radical activities may be inhibited by butylated hydroxytoluene, hydrocortisone, ACF, RNA, alpha-tocopherol, and, in special circumstances, with fully metabolized iron. Choline and oxidized copper and iron cations in overload concentrations in incubated freshly in lysosomes may catalyse radical activities, and they may be important factors in lipofuscin formation and its role in aging.
22122081	Hormonal gene regulation through DNA methylation and demethylation.	lifespan, aging	2010-12-??	Methylation and demethylation of cytosine residues in the genomic DNA play key roles in a wide range of fundamental biological processes such as differentiation and development, genome stability, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, carcinogenesis and aging. DNA methylation is considered to be a stable modification associated with the epigenetic silencing of genomic loci and maintained through cellular division. Recent studies however, suggest that DNA methylation and demethylation are considerably more dynamic than previously thought and may be involved in repression and derepression of gene activity during the lifespan of a cell. This article is focused on epigenetic mechanisms in the hormonal regulation of the cytochrome p450 27B1 or CYP27B1 gene activity that involve reversible epigenetic modifications to chromatin and DNA methylation profiles.
21223406	Physiological and behavioural response patterns at work among hospital nurses.	aging	2011-01-??	AIM: The aim was to determine whether hospital nurses are experiencing physiological strain at work by examining their physiological and behavioural response patterns over 12-hour shifts.    BACKGROUND: Excessive workload for nurses may lead to poor quality of care and high nursing turnover rates. Energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR) and work pace (WP) can be used to examine the physiological impact from the workload.    METHODS: A total of 145 nurses wore monitors for one 12-hour day shift to record HR and WP, which were used to calculate EE. Individual and work-related factors were assessed through questionnaires and work logs.    RESULTS: Energy expenditure accumulated over the 12 hours reached the EE level of 8-hour shifts in which individuals work at a moderate physical intensity level. The HR data indicated a moderate cardiac stress level throughout the shifts, despite which WP decreased after 15.00 hours. Inadequate work break and sleep, family care-giving responsibility and…
29133421	Early Neolithic wine of Georgia in the South Caucasus.	aging	2017-??-28	Chemical analyses of ancient organic compounds absorbed into the pottery fabrics from sites in Georgia in the South Caucasus region, dating to the early Neolithic period (ca. 6,000-5,000 BC), provide the earliest biomolecular archaeological evidence for grape wine and viniculture from the Near East, at ca. 6,000-5,800 BC. The chemical findings are corroborated by climatic and environmental reconstruction, together with archaeobotanical evidence, including grape pollen, starch, and epidermal remains associated with a jar of similar type and date. The very large-capacity jars, some of the earliest pottery made in the Near East, probably served as combination fermentation, aging, and serving vessels. They are the most numerous pottery type at many sites comprising the so-called "Shulaveri-Shomutepe Culture" of the Neolithic period, which extends into western Azerbaijan and northern Armenia. The discovery of early sixth millennium BC grape wine in this region is crucial to the later histor…
22533422	Biomarine extracts significantly protect from ultraviolet A-induced skin photoaging: an ex vivo study.	aging	2012-04-??	We tested the activity of the marine nutraceutical CL-1222 added with a coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)-lutein-selenium component (Celergen(®), Laboratoires-Dom, Switzerland) to protect human fibroblasts against ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced photoaging. Cells obtained from 22- to 39-year-old healthy donors were pretreated with CL-1222 before UV irradiation, as compared with same quantity of the CoQ10-lutein-selenium component. As compared to untreated control, UVA-irradiated samples exhibited a significant increase of secreted matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) (p<0.001) with over four-fold MMP-1 upregulation (p<0.001). Samples treated with CL-1222, but not with the CoQ10-lutein-selenium component, showed a significant decrease of MMP-1 secretion (p<0.01) and expression decrease (>60%, p<0.01) with >54% elastase activity inhibition (p<0.01). This preliminary study shows that such marine nutraceuticals can significantly protect against UV-irradiation irrespective of the CoQ10-lutein-selenium compone…
18695589	Validation of the modified telephone interview for cognitive status in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and intact elders.	aging	????-??-??	Although the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (mTICS) is frequently used as a screening measure of cognition in dementia and aging studies, it has not been validated in individuals with milder cognitive impairments. The current study compared 2 groups [amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (n=61) and cognitively intact elders (n=62)] on the mTICS and used regression models to predict baseline scores on standardized memory tests using baseline mTICS scores. Baseline mTICS scores were also used to predict 1-year follow-up scores on memory tests in a subsample (n=91). Large group differences (P<0.01) were found between the amnestic individuals and their healthy peers on the mTICS total score, 2-factor scores, and 3 of 14 individual items. Baseline mTICS scores predicted between 22% and 43% of baseline memory composite scores and 21% and 28% of 1-year memory composite scores. Overall, these results provide additional validation of the mTICS as a valuable screening instrument …
12730253	Prevalence of sarcopenia and predictors of skeletal muscle mass in nonobese women who are long-term users of estrogen-replacement therapy.	aging	2003-05-??	BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia refers to the loss of skeletal muscle mass with age. We have found a prevalence of sarcopenia of 22.6% in older postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in a population of older, nonobese, community-dwelling women who had been long-term users of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).    METHODS: We measured appendicular skeletal muscle mass by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 189 women aged 59 to 78 years old who had been using ERT for at least 2 years (mean +/- SD duration, 12.7 +/- 8.2 years). We defined sarcopenia as an adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) (mass divided by height squared) more than 2 SDs below the mean for a young healthy reference population. Health and menopause history were obtained. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and physical activity and performance were measured using the Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly, the chair rise time, the 6-minut…
12807897	C174T polymorphism in the CNTF receptor gene is associated with fat-free mass in men and women.	aging	2003-10-??	We performed gene screening of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) gene and genotyped three newly identified polymorphisms: C-1703T in the 5' promoter region, T1069A in intron 5, and C174T in exon 9. We studied the association of these CNTFR variants with muscle strength, mass, and body composition in 465 men and women (20-90 yr) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Only the C174T variant was significantly associated with muscle-related phenotypes. In the entire cohort, when corrected for age, sex, race, physical activity, and height, homozygotes for the common C allele at C174T (CC) exhibited lower total body mass and body mass index than carriers of the rare T allele, which appeared to be due to significant differences in total nonosseous fat-free mass (FFM) (48.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 50.0 +/- 0.7 kg; P = 0.011) and lower limb FFM (16.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 17.2 +/- 0.2 kg; P = 0.002). The CC group also exhibited significantly lower quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokineti…
20110814	Air pollution and homocysteine: more evidence that oxidative stress-related genes modify effects of particulate air pollution.	aging	2010-03-??	BACKGROUND: Ambient particles are associated with cardiovascular events and recently with total plasma homocysteine. High total plasma homocysteine is a risk for human health. However, the biologic mechanisms are not fully understood. One of the putative pathways is through oxidative stress. We aimed to examine whether associations of PM2.5 and black carbon with homocysteine were modified by genotypes including HFE H63D, C282Y, CAT (rs480575, rs1001179, rs2284367, and rs2300181), NQO1 (rs1800566), GSTP1 I105V, GSTM1, GSTT1 (deletion vs. nondeletion), and HMOX-1 (any short vs. both long). We attempted to replicate identified genes in an analysis of heart rate variability and in other outcomes reported in the literature.    METHODS: Study subjects were 1000 white non-Hispanic men in the Boston area, participating in a cohort study of aging. PM2.5, black carbon, total plasma homocysteine, and other covariates were measured at several points in time between 1995 and 2006. We fit mixed mode…
9633518	Oxidative stress leads to a rapid alteration of transferrin receptor intravesicular trafficking.	aging	1998-05-25	Several studies have demonstrated that perturbations of intracellular oxidative balance play a key role in numerous physiological as well as pathological conditions leading to various morbidity states. In previous studies we have shown that the free radical inducer menadione rapidly and specifically downmodulates the membrane transferrin receptor (TfR) by blocking receptor recycling. This modulation is due to receptor redistribution and not to receptor loss. Here we show that other oxidant compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, also induce a rapid downmodulation of membrane TfR and that pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant, thiol supplier, N-acetylcysteine inhibits the downmodulation of these receptors elicited by either menadione or hydrogen peroxide. This observation suggests that intracellular thiol redox status may be a critical determinant of TfR downmodulation induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, immunocytochemical results show that, in menadione-treated cells, TfRs are…
23277110	Age-related differences in iron content of subcortical nuclei observed in vivo: a meta-analysis.	lifespan, aging	2013-04-15	Accumulation of non-heme iron in the brain has been proposed as a biomarker of the progressive neuroanatomical and cognitive declines in healthy adult aging. Postmortem studies indicate that iron content and lifespan differences therein are regionally specific, with a predilection for the basal ganglia. However, the reported in vivo estimates of adult age differences in iron content within subcortical nuclei are highly variable. We present a meta-analysis of 20 in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that estimated iron content in the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, red nucleus, and substantia nigra. The results of the analyses support a robust association between advanced age and high iron content in the substantia nigra and striatum, with a smaller effect noted in the globus pallidus. The magnitude of age differences in estimated iron content of the caudate nucleus and putamen partially depended on the method of estimation, but not on the type of design (continuou…
26689713	The effect of cognitive fatigue on prefrontal cortex correlates of neuromuscular fatigue in older women.	aging	2015-12-21	BACKGROUND: As the population of adults aged 65 and above is rapidly growing, it is crucial to identify physical and cognitive limitations pertaining to daily living. Cognitive fatigue has shown to adversely impact neuromuscular function in younger adults, however its impact on neuromuscular fatigue, and associated brain function changes, in older adults is not well understood. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of cognitive fatigue on neuromuscular fatigue and associated prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation patterns in older women.    METHODS: Eleven older (75.82 (7.4) years) females attended two sessions and performed intermittent handgrip exercises at 30 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) until voluntary exhaustion after a 60-min control (watching documentary) and 60-min cognitive fatigue (performing Stroop Color Word and 1-Back tests) condition. Dependent measures included endurance time, strength loss, PFC activity (measured using fNIRS), force fluctuations, muscle ac…
1491740	Sleep-disordered breathing in healthy and spousally bereaved elderly: a one-year follow-up study.	aging	????-??-??	This study examined the progression of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) over 1 year in two samples of elderly subjects: 45 healthy controls (20 men; 25 women mean age 74.8 years) and 27 recently spousally bereaved elders (9 men; 18 women, mean age 69.7 years). Although controls and bereaved subjects did not differ in the proportions with SDB, both groups showed a rise in the proportion of subjects with apnea hypopnea index > or = 5 and > or = 10 at 1-year follow-up and a small but statistically significant worsening in average maximum desaturation. The severity of SDB did not correlate with medical burden or with other clinical variables, such as severity of depressive symptoms. In summary, SDB increased longitudinally in both samples. This finding may have health implications for the aging population although at this time the implications are unclear.
23197700	Increased bilateral frontal connectivity during working memory in young adults under the influence of a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist.	aging	2012-11-28	Increased frontal bilaterality in old compared with young adults during cognitive performance is a common finding in human functional neuroimaging studies. Age-related reductions in laterality are a widely debated topic and their origins and consequences may be manifold. The current study demonstrates that a dopamine (DA) D1 antagonist induces increased frontal bilateral connectivity in healthy young adults revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging during a spatial working memory task. Moreover, increases in functional connectivity between right and left prefrontal cortex during the pharmacological challenge were associated with maintaining performance on drug. To our knowledge, this is the first study to pharmacologically induce increased frontal bilateral functional connectivity during a cognitive task in young adults and to show that increased bilaterality is associated with less severe cognitive impairment under the influence of a DA receptor antagonist.
28244566	Reversible States of Physical and/or Cognitive Dysfunction: A 9-Year Longitudinal Study.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVES: To determine 1) age-adjusted transition probabilities to worsening physical/cognitive function states, reversal to normal cognition/physical function, or maintenance of normal state; 2) whether these transitions are modulated by sex, BMI, education, hypertension (HTN), health status, or APOE4; 3) whether worsening gait speed preceded cognition change, or vice versa.    DESIGN: Analysis of 9-year prospective cohort data from the New Mexico Aging Process Study.    SETTING: Healthy independent-living adults.    PARTICIPANTS: 60+ years of age (n= 598).    MEASUREMENTS: Gait speed, cognitive function (3MSE score), APOE4, HTN, BMI, education, health status.    RESULTS: Over 9 years, 2129 one-year transitions were observed. 32.6% stayed in the same state, while gait speed and cognitive function (3MSE scores) improved for 38% and 43% of participants per year, respectively. Transitions to improved function decreased with age (P< 0.001), APOE4 status (P=0.02), BMI (P=0.009), and heal…
25090911	Epigenetic changes of mesenchymal stem cells in three-dimensional (3D) spheroids.	aging	2014-10-??	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold profound promise in tissue repair/regeneration. However, MSCs undergo remarkable spontaneous differentiation and aging during monolayer culture expansion. In this study, we found that 2-3 days of three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture of human MSCs (hMSCs) that had been expanded in monolayer for six passages increased their clonogenicity and differentiation potency to neuronal cells. Moreover, in accordance with these changes, the expression levels of miRNA which were involved in stem cell potency were changed and levels of histone H3 acetylation in K9 in promoter regions of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog were elevated. Our results indicate that spheroid culture increases their multi-potency and changes the epigenetic status of pluripotent genes in hMSCs.
28160545	Impact of resistance training on the autophagy-inflammation-apoptosis crosstalk in elderly subjects.	aging	2017-??-02	Aging is associated with a decline in autophagy and a state of low-grade inflammation which further affects apoptosis and autophagy. Importantly, these alterations could reverse with regular physical activity. This study assessed the effects of a resistance exercise training program on autophagy, NLRP3 inflammasome, and apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from old subjects. Twenty-six healthy women and men (age, 69.6±1.5 yr) were randomized to a training (TG) or a control (CG) group. TG performed an 8-week resistance training program, while CG followed their daily routines. Protein expression of beclin-1, Atg12, Atg16 and LAMP-2 increased following the training program, while expression of p62/SQSTM1 and phosphorylation of ULK-1 at Ser757 were significantly lower. Resistance exercise also induced a decrease in NLRP3 expression and in the caspase-1/procaspase-1 ratio. Expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, as well as the Bad/BcL-2 ratio were reduced, and there was a signifi…
1119343	Biosynthesis of collagen during the life cycle of human diploid cell lines.	aging	1975-??-??	In the course of the active phase of growth collagen synthesis appears relatively stable and decreases when the culture passes into the degenerative phase III. The increase of cell nitrogen indicates the increasing accumulation of cell proteins with their aging in vitro. The ratio of soluble to insoluble collagen is relatively constant in fibroblast cultures from different tissues, periods of development during the active phase of growth. The increase of insoluble collagen in long term cultivated Marfan syndrome fibroblasts indicates the possible relationship between increasing stability of collagen and ageing of fibroblasts in vitro. Further studies confirmed the significant differences between control fibroblast and fibroblast derived from tissues of patients affected by Marfan syndrome. No differences were found in collagen synthesis and in the ratio of soluble to insoluble collagen in fibroblast strains from embryos, foetuses, children and young adults. The collagen synthesis and t…
15781285	Mechanisms for the induction of HNE- MDA- and AGE-adducts, RAGE and VEGF in retinal pigment epithelial cells.	aging	2005-04-??	Pathological features of age-related macular degeneration such as the formation of extracellular deposits and neovascularization are frequently viewed as outcomes of compromising processes within retinal pigment epithelial cells, but the initiating circumstances are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that photooxidation events initiated by A2E, a blue light-excitable aging fluorophore of the retinal pigment epithelium, can set the stage for altered cellular signaling and changes in the expression of genes that can impact the extracellular milieu. Proteins modified by lipid peroxidation products (4-hydroxynonenal; malondialdhyde) and advanced glycation end products were detected at sites of blue light irradiation both in association with the cultured A2E-laden retinal pigment epithelial cells and within the fibronectin substrate on which the cells were grown. RAGE, the cell surface receptor that transduces the effects of advanced glycation end products, was also upregulate…
10677564	Induction of the putative protective protein ferritin by infrared radiation: implications in skin repair.	aging	2000-03-??	The modification of ferritin in human skin cells in vitro and in vivo following infrared-A irradiation by immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA were evaluated. In addition, we observed that IR-A is not capable of inducing frank damage to DNA (pyrimidine dimers, p53), induction of oxidative stress proteins (heme oxygenase, nitric oxide, superoxide dismutase, heat shock proteins) or proteases (collagenase, stromelysin, gelatinase) involved in carcinogenesis and photoaging of the skin. in vivo, basal levels of ferritin were heterogeneous for all individuals tested but all showed ferritin to stain precisely in the basal layer of unirradiated epidermis. Following IR-A radiation, the ferritin increase was localized to epidermal tissue and showed an increase from 120 to 220%. Parallel to the in vivo analysis, dermal fibroblasts were cultured from six individuals. Quantitative analysis for ferritin in cultured fibroblasts was assessed by ELISA and increases were seen to be dose-dependent and …
23462851	Thirdhand smoke causes DNA damage in human cells.	aging	2013-07-??	Exposure to thirdhand smoke (THS) is a newly described health risk. Evidence supports its widespread presence in indoor environments. However, its genotoxic potential, a critical aspect in risk assessment, is virtually untested. An important characteristic of THS is its ability to undergo chemical transformations during aging periods, as demonstrated in a recent study showing that sorbed nicotine reacts with the indoor pollutant nitrous acid (HONO) to form tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-4-(3-pyridyl)butanal (NNA) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). The goal of this study was to assess the genotoxicity of THS in human cell lines using two in vitro assays. THS was generated in laboratory systems that simulated short (acute)- and long (chronic)-term exposures. Analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantified TSNAs and common tobacco alkaloids in extracts of THS that had sorbed onto cellulose substrates. Exposu…
8058126	Synaptophysin gene expression in human brain: a quantitative in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical study.	aging	1994-04-??	Synaptophysin is a presynaptic vesicle protein. Its quantitative detection has become established as a molecular marker of synaptic density. We have studied synaptophysin messenger RNA in the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum using in situ hybridization histochemistry to see if the encoding transcript can be detected in post mortem human brain and to investigate factors which might influence its abundance. Synaptophysin was also measured immunocytochemically in the hippocampus. The level of synaptophysin messenger RNA expression was uniform in all neocortical areas examined. Strong correlations were found for the amount of synaptophysin messenger RNA between individual regions and between homologous areas in the two hemispheres. Synaptophysin messenger RNA declined with increasing age and prolonged post mortem interval. Synaptophysin immunoreactivity also reduced with age, as well as with duration of formalin fixation but not post mortem interval. Synaptophysin immunoreactivity cor…
12071839	Activation of protein kinase CK2 is an early step in the ultraviolet B-mediated increase in interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1; MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) protein levels in human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2002-07-01	Enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1/interstitial collagenase and MMP-3/stromelysin-1 in skin fibroblasts and subsequent damage of dermal connective tissue in the context of sun-induced premature aging and skin tumour progression is causally linked to UVB irradiation. Here, we were interested in identifying components of the complex signal-transduction pathway underlying UVB-mediated up-regulation of these delayed UV-responsive genes and focused on components maximally activated early after irradiation. A 2.3-fold increase in protein kinase CK2 activity was measured at 20-40 min after low-dose UVB irradiation (at 10 mJ/cm2) of dermal fibroblasts. This UVB-mediated increase in CK2 activity was abrogated by pharmacological approaches using non-toxic concentrations of the CK2 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). Preincubation of fibroblasts with DRB prior to UVB irradiation lowered MMP-1 by 49-69% and MMP-3 protein levels by 55-63% compared …
29473908	l-Carnitine Supplementation in Older Women. A Pilot Study on Aging Skeletal Muscle Mass and Function.	aging	2018-02-23	Skeletal muscle wasting, associated with aging, may be regulated by the inflammatory cytokines as well as by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). l-carnitine possesses anti-inflammatory properties and increases plasma IGF-1 concentration, leading to the regulation of the genes responsible for protein catabolism and anabolism. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a 24-week l-carnitine supplementation on serum inflammatory markers, IGF-1, body composition and skeletal muscle strength in healthy human subjects over 65 years of age. Women between 65 and 70 years of age were supplemented for 24 weeks with either 1500 mg l-carnitine-l-tartrate or an isonitrogenous placebo per day in a double-blind fashion. Before and after the supplementation protocol, body mass and composition, as well as knee extensor and flexor muscle strength were determined. In the blood samples, free carnitine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein and IGF-1 were determin…
2911322	Abnormalities in parathyroid hormone secretion and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 formation in women with osteoporosis.	aging	1989-02-02	We investigated the parathyroid hormone-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) axis in osteoporosis by administering phosphate to 8 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (49 to 78 years old) and to 10 normal women matched for age (50 to 74 years). All subjects responded with a similar increase in the serum phosphorus concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.15 +/- 0.06 to 1.79 +/- 0.09 mmol per liter; controls, 1.14 +/- 0.05 to 1.73 +/- 0.08 mmol per liter) and a fall in the ionized calcium concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.12 +/- 0.03 to 1.06 +/- 0.03 mmol per liter; controls, 1.17 +/- 0.01 to 1.11 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter). Parathyroid hormone levels rose 2.5-fold in the control group (15.4 +/- 2.2 to 37.9 +/- 6.1 pg per milliliter) but increased by only 43 percent in the group with osteoporosis (14.8 +/- 2.8 to 21.2 +/- 4.1 pg per milliliter), an increase similar to that previously reported in young normal subjects (53 percent). In healthy older and younger subjects, the lev…
16372474	Comparative study of the anti-aging effect of retinaldehyde alone or associated with pretocopheryl in a surviving human skin model submitted to ultraviolet A and B irradiation.	aging	2005-??-??	In the past few years, the cellular effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induced on skin have become increasingly recognized. Indeed, it is now well known that UV irradiation induces structural and cellular changes in all the compartments of skin tissue. Our aim was to study the anti-aging efficacy of a cosmetic cream containing 0.05% retinaldehyde associated with an antioxidant such as pretocopheryl in comparison with a cream containing only 0.05% retinaldehyde. For this purpose, an ex vivo technique using human skin was used to approximate in vivo metabolic conditions. In this model, human skin was maintained alive by organ culture for 14 days and skin aging was simulated with UV irradiation. Creams were applied to the surface of the epidermis and were compared with nontreated skin. After 14 days, free radical modulation was analyzed by hydroperoxide dosage. Epidermal (laminin) and dermal changes (elastic fibers and collagen) were studied by a histological method. Moreover, to exa…
19839736	The two isomers of HDTIC compounds from Astragali Radix slow down telomere shortening rate via attenuating oxidative stress and increasing DNA repair ability in human fetal lung diploid fibroblast cells.	lifespan	2010-01-??	4-Hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-[1,3]dioxolan-2,6'-spirane-5',6',7',8'-tetrahydro-indolizine-3'-carbaldehyde (HDTIC)-1 and HDTIC-2 are two isomers extracted from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bunge Var. mongholicus (Bge) Hsiao. Our previous study had demonstrated that they could extend the lifespan of human fetal lung diploid fibroblasts (2BS). To investigate the mechanisms of the HDTIC-induced delay of replicative senescence, in this study, we assessed the effects of these two compounds on telomere shortening rate and DNA repair ability in 2BS cells. The telomere shortening rates of the cells cultured with HDTIC-1 or HDTIC-2 were 31.5 and 41.1 bp with each division, respectively, which were much less than that of the control cells (71.1 bp/PD). We also found that 2BS cells pretreated with HDTIC-1 or HDTIC-2 had a significant reduction in DNA damage after exposure to 200 microM H(2)O(2) for 5 min. Moreover, the 100 microM H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage was significantly repaired after the dam…
19580676	Test-retest variability of high resolution positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cortical serotonin (5HT2A) receptors in older, healthy adults.	aging	2009-07-06	BACKGROUND: Position emission tomography (PET) imaging using [18F]-setoperone to quantify cortical 5-HT2A receptors has the potential to inform pharmacological treatments for geriatric depression and dementia. Prior reports indicate a significant normal aging effect on serotonin 5HT2A receptor (5HT2AR) binding potential. The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest variability of [18F]-setoperone PET with a high resolution scanner (HRRT) for measuring 5HT2AR availability in subjects greater than 60 years old.    METHODS: Six healthy subjects (age range = 65-78 years) completed two [18F]-setoperone PET scans on two separate occasions 5-16 weeks apart.    RESULTS: The average difference in the binding potential (BPND) as measured on the two occasions in the frontal and temporal cortical regions ranged between 2 and 12%, with the lowest intraclass correlation coefficient in anterior cingulate regions.    CONCLUSION: We conclude that the test-retest variability of [18F]-setopero…
17518701	Microsatellite instability and compromised mismatch repair gene expression during in vitro passaging of monoclonal human T lymphocytes.	aging	2007-06-??	An age-related accumulation of DNA damage caused by increased insult and/or decreased repair, could contribute to impaired cellular function. DNA mismatch repair (MMR), the main postreplicative correction pathway, can be monitored by assessing microsatellite instability and has been reported to decrease with age. Here, we analyzed the involvement of the MMR system in the accumulation of genetic damage in a cultured monoclonal human T lymphocyte model. We correlated microsatellite instability (MSI) and MMR gene expression, and replicative senescence of CD4+ clones derived from young, old and centenarian individuals or from CD34+ precursors. Cells were analyzed for MSI at five loci (CD4, VWA, Fes, D2S123, and BAT26), for the methylation status of MLH1 and MSH2 gene promoters, and for the expression of the MMR genes MSH2, MSH6, MSH3, MLH1, PMS2, and PMS1. MSI increased with increasing culture passages, particularly in the CD34+ progenitor-derived clones, but also in those from adult T cel…
11108758	Endothelin-1 in subarachnoid hemorrhage: An acute-phase reactant produced by cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes.	aging	2000-12-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most potent vasoconstrictor known, endothelin-1, is currently considered to mediate cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which can cause delayed cerebral ischemia. In our study, we performed clinical and in vitro experiments to investigate the origin and the mechanisms of the secretion of endothelin-1 in SAH.    METHODS: Endothelin-1 and markers of inflammatory host response (interleukin [IL]-1ss, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were comparatively quantified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SAH patients and control subjects, and concentrations were related to clinical characteristics. Furthermore, mononuclear leukocytes isolated from the CSF of SAH patients and control subjects were analyzed regarding their mRNA expression of endothelin-1 and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, complementary in vitro experiments were performed to investigate whether coincubation of blood and CSF can trigger leukocytic mRNA expression and release of the…
26110199	Subclinical Hypothyroidism is not a Risk Factor for Female Sexual Dysfunction in Korean Middle-Aged Women.	aging	2015-07-??	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with the risk of anxiety or depression and can affect quality of life. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism and female sexual dysfunction.    METHODS: The study population consisted of sexually active middle-aged women (≥40 years old) who visited the center for health promotion and optimal aging at Seoul National University Hospital for a health check-up between 2010 and 2011. Sexual function was evaluated by the female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire, and female sexual dysfunction was defined as a FSFI score of ≤26.55. FSFI scores and female sexual dysfunction frequencies were compared between cases with subclinical hypothyroidism and healthy controls. Nonparametric methods were used for statistical analysis.    RESULTS: A total of 1086 women were included, and the frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism and female sex…
27384230	Effects of arterial transit delay on cerebral blood flow quantification using arterial spin labeling in an elderly cohort.	aging	2017-??-??	PURPOSE: To investigate whether measurement of arterial transit time (ATT) can improve the accuracy of arterial spin labeling (ASL) cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification in an elderly cohort due to the potentially prolonged ATT in the cohort.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a 1-minute, low-resolution (12 mm in-plane), sequential multidelay ATT measurement (both with and without vessel suppression) approach to characterize and correct ATT errors in CBF imaging of an elderly, clinical cohort. In all, 140 nondemented subjects greater than 70 years old were imaged at 3T with a single delay, volumetric continuous ASL sequence and also with the fast ATT measurement method. Nine healthy young subjects (28 ± 6 years old) were also imaged.    RESULTS: ATTs measured without vessel suppression (superior frontal: 1.51 ± 0.27 sec) in the elderly were significantly shorter than those with suppression (P < 0.0001). Correction of CBF for ATT significantly increased average CBF in multiple bra…
9271777	Longtime administration of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) does not restore the reduced efficiency of GHRH on sleep endocrine activity in 2 old-aged subjects--a preliminary study.	aging	1997-07-??	Aging results in a more shallow sleep accompanied by a blunted growth hormone (GH) secretion. In young male normal controls repetitive administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) at the beginning of the night results in an increased secretion of GH, a blunting of cortisol and a stimulation of slow-wave sleep (SWS). In healthy elderly men and women, however, GHRH exerts only weak effects on sleep-endocrine activity. In a previous report continuous treatment of healthy elderly males by repetitive administration of GHRH (during 12 days administration with 100 micrograms GHRH i.v. at 9.00 h every second day, "priming") enhanced GHRH stimulated GH secretion at daytime markedly. We tested if priming with GHRH results in a more distinct modulation of the nocturnal hormone secretion and of the sleep EEG than acute administration of the peptide. Two elderly male controls spent first three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory, the first of which served for adaptation to laboratory condit…
25149687	ER Stress Response in Human Cellular Models of Senescence.	aging	2015-08-??	The aging process is characterized by progressive accumulation of damaged biomolecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, as result of increased oxidative stress accompanying cellular senescence. In agreement, we hypothesized that WI-38 human cellular models of replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2-SIPS) or copper sulfate (CuSO4-SIPS) would present endoplasmic reticulum chaperoning mechanisms impairment and unfolded protein response activation. Results show that in replicative senescence and CuSO4-SIPS, immunoglobulin binding protein, calnexin, protein disulfide isomerase, and ER oxireductin-1 levels adjust to restore proteostasis and inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1)-, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-, and pancreatic ER kinase (PERK)-mediated unfolded protein response are activated. However, H2O2-SIPS does not exhibit IRE1 and ATF6 pathways activation but a PERK-mediated upregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding prot…
10022898	Differential roles for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p16 in the mechanisms of senescence and differentiation in human fibroblasts.	aging	1999-03-??	The irreversible G1 arrest in senescent human diploid fibroblasts is probably caused by inactivation of the G1 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes responsible for phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). We show that the Cdk inhibitor p21(Sdi1,Cip1,Waf1), which accumulates progressively in aging cells, binds to and inactivates all cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes in senescent cells, whereas in young cells only p21-free Cdk2 complexes are active. Furthermore, the senescent-cell-cycle arrest occurs prior to the accumulation of the Cdk4-Cdk6 inhibitor p16(Ink4a), suggesting that p21 may be sufficient for this event. Accordingly, cyclin D1-associated phosphorylation of pRb at Ser-780 is lacking even in newly senescent fibroblasts that have a low amount of p16. Instead, the cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin D1-Cdk6 complexes in these cells are associated with an increased amount of p21, suggesting that p21 may be responsible for inactivation of both cyclin E- and cyclin D1-associated …
30760704	KDEL receptor regulates secretion by lysosome relocation- and autophagy-dependent modulation of lipid-droplet turnover.	aging	2019-??-13	Inter-organelle signalling has essential roles in cell physiology encompassing cell metabolism, aging and temporal adaptation to external and internal perturbations. How such signalling coordinates different organelle functions within adaptive responses remains unknown. Membrane traffic is a fundamental process in which membrane fluxes need to be sensed for the adjustment of cellular requirements and homeostasis. Studying endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking, we found that Golgi-based, KDEL receptor-dependent signalling promotes lysosome repositioning to the perinuclear area, involving a complex process intertwined to autophagy, lipid-droplet turnover and Golgi-mediated secretion that engages the microtubule motor protein dynein-LRB1 and the autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1. This process, here named 'traffic-induced degradation response for secretion' (TIDeRS) discloses a cellular mechanism by which nutrient and membrane sensing machineries cooperate to sustain Golgi-dependent…
19651040	Modulation of titin-based stiffness by disulfide bonding in the cardiac titin N2-B unique sequence.	aging	2009-08-05	The giant protein titin is responsible for the elasticity of nonactivated muscle sarcomeres. Titin-based passive stiffness in myocardium is modulated by titin-isoform switching and protein-kinase (PK)A- or PKG-dependent titin phosphorylation. Additional modulatory effects on titin stiffness may arise from disulfide bonding under oxidant stress, as many immunoglobulin-like (Ig-)domains in titin's spring region have a potential for S-S formation. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) force-extension measurements on recombinant Ig-domain polyprotein constructs, we show that titin Ig-modules contain no stabilizing disulfide bridge, contrary to previous belief. However, we demonstrate that the human N2-B-unique sequence (N2-B(us)), a cardiac-specific, physiologically extensible titin segment comprising 572 amino-acid residues, contains up to three disulfide bridges under oxidizing conditions. AFM force spectroscopy on recombinant N2-B(us) molecules demonstrated a much shorter …
15805212	In vivo degradation of polyethylene liners after gamma sterilization in air.	aging	2005-04-??	BACKGROUND: Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene degrades during storage in air following gamma sterilization, but the extent of in vivo degradation remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to quantify the extent to which the mechanical properties and oxidation of conventional polyethylene acetabular liners treated with gamma sterilization in air change in vivo.    METHODS: Fourteen modular cementless acetabular liners were revised at an average of 10.3 years (range, 5.9 to 13.5 years) after implantation. All liners, which had been machined from GUR 415 resin, had been gamma-sterilized in air; the average shelf life was 0.3 year (range, 0.0 to 0.8 year). After removal, the components were expeditiously frozen to minimize ex vivo changes to the polyethylene prior to characterization. The average duration between freezing and testing was 0.6 year. Mechanical properties and oxidation were measured with use of the small-punch test and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, resp…
26717024	RECQL5 has unique strand annealing properties relative to the other human RecQ helicase proteins.	aging	2016-01-??	The RecQ helicases play important roles in genome maintenance and DNA metabolism (replication, recombination, repair, and transcription). Five different homologs are present in humans, three of which are implicated in accelerated aging genetic disorders: Rothmund Thomson (RECQL4), Werner (WRN), and Bloom (BLM) syndromes. While the DNA helicase activities of the 5 human RecQ helicases have been extensively characterized, much less is known about their DNA double strand annealing activities. Strand annealing is an important integral enzymatic activity in DNA metabolism, including DNA repair. Here, we have characterized the strand annealing activities of all five human RecQ helicase proteins and compared them. Interestingly, the relative strand annealing activities of the five RecQ proteins are not directly (inversely) related to their helicase activities. RECQL5 possesses relatively strong annealing activity on long or small duplexed substrates compared to the other RecQs. Additionally, …
19801502	Oxidative stress can alter the antigenicity of immunodominant peptides.	aging	2010-01-??	APCs operate frequently under oxidative stress induced by aging, tissue damage, pathogens, or inflammatory responses. Phagocytic cells produce peroxides and free-radical species that facilitate pathogen clearance and can in the case of APCs, also lead to oxidative modifications of antigenic proteins and peptides. Little information is available presently about the consequences of such modifications on the immune response. To model oxidative modification of an immunodominant antigenic peptide, we oxidized the methionine residue of the human CMV pp65(495-503) (NLVPMVATV) peptide. Such modifications of an antigenic peptide can affect MHC binding or TCR recognition. Using binding and dissociation assays, we demonstrate that oxidative modification of the CMVpp65(495-503) peptide leads to a decreased binding of the pMHC complex to the TCR, whereas binding of the peptide to the MHC class I molecule is not impaired. Additionally, we show that CD8(+) T cells have a decreased proliferation and I…
22259223	Regulation of the human tyrosinase gene in retinal pigment epithelium cells: the significance of transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 and its polymorphic binding site.	aging	2012-??-??	PURPOSE: Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for melanin biosynthesis in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye. Melanin has an important role in retinal development, function, and protection against light-induced oxidative stress, and melanin levels are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Because the levels of and protection afforded by melanin seem to decline with increasing age, proper regulation of the human tyrosinase gene (TYR) in the RPE is an important but insufficiently understood process. Our purpose was to obtain detailed information on regulation of the TYR gene promoter in the human RPE and to specify the role of orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).    METHODS: We used luciferase reporter constructs to study regulation of the human TYR gene promoter in cultured human RPE cells. We further studied the role of OTX2 and MITF, their binding sites, and endogenous expression by usin…
21259001	Oxidative stress-induced membrane shedding from RBCs is Ca flux-mediated and affects membrane lipid composition.	aging	2011-03-??	Phosphatidylserine (PS), which is normally localized in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane, undergoes externalization during aging or trauma of red blood cells (RBCS: ). A fraction of this PS is shed into the extracellular milieu. Both PS externalization and shedding are modulated by the oxidative state of the cells. In the present study we investigated the effect of calcium (Ca) flux on oxidative stress-induced membrane distribution of PS and its shedding and on the membrane composition and functions. Normal human RBCs were treated with the oxidant t-butyl hydroperoxide, and thalassemic RBCs, which are under oxidative stress, were treated with the antioxidant vitamin C or N-acetylcystein. The intracellular Ca content was modulated by the Ca ionophore A23187 and by varying the Ca concentration in the medium. Ca flux was measured by Fluo-3, PS externalization and shedding were measured by quantitative flow cytometry and membrane composition was measured by (1)H-NMR analysis of the …
25335378	Antioxidant status and reproductive hormones in women during reproductive, perimenopausal and postmenopausal phase of life.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: Reproductive aging resulting in menopause with permanent cessation of ovarian follicular activity. The progressive loss of estrogen and its protective effects, combined with deficient endogenous antioxidant results in oxidative stress.    OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of oxidative stress and its relationship with reproductive hormones at various developmental phases of women.    METHODS: A total of 186 (65 in Reproductive, 58 in Perimenopausal, and 63 in Postmenopausal phase) participants between the ages of 20-60 years were recruited for the study. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, estradiol, total antioxidant status (TAS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH); activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels were all determined.    RESULTS: FSH, LH and MDA levels were significantly increased during perimenopausal and postmenopausal phases compared to reproductive p…
12969763	Inhibition of ultraviolet-A-modulated signaling pathways by asiatic acid and ursolic acid in HaCaT human keratinocytes.	aging	2003-08-29	Premature aging of the skin (photoaging) is a well-documented consequence of exposure to ultraviolet-A (UVA). Enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) appear to be the most important components of UVA-modulated signal transduction pathways, ultimately leading to photoaging. In this study, we investigated the effects of asiatic acid and ursolic acid, triterpene compounds, on the UVA-modulated signaling pathways using HaCaT human keratinocytes as a model cellular system. In the cells, we confirmed that UVA irradiation induced oxidative stress and increased the expression of MMP-2. Asiatic acid and ursolic acid significantly suppressed the UVA-induced reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation. Pretreatment with asiatic acid or ursolic acid significantly reduced the UVA-induced activation and expression of MMP-2. In addition, UVA-induced enhanced expression of p53, a hallmark of UV-induced DNA damage and cell death, wa…
27240192	The Influence of Prefermentative Addition of Gallic Acid on the Phenolic Composition and Chromatic Characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon Wines.	aging	2016-07-??	In this study, the prefermentative addition of gallic acid in Cabernet Sauvignon red winemaking was performed. The influence of gallic acid addition on wine phenolic composition, the ratio of copigmentation, and the color parameters were monitored throughout the winemaking process. The results showed that the prefermentative addition of gallic acid enhanced the extraction of total anthocyanins and the copigmentation effect, producing wines with more darkness, redness, yellowness, and saturation. Moreover, the addition of gallic acid contributed to the concentration of total phenolic acids. However, it had a negative effect on the concentrations of flavonols and flavan-3-ols in the final wines. Thus, the prefermentative addition of gallic acid at appropriate levels might be a promising enological technology to obtain wines with high color quality and aging potential.
14739709	Dolichol: a solar filter with UV-absorbing properties which can be photoenhanced.	aging	2003-??-??	Dolichol, the polyisoprenoid lipid found in all eukaryotic cells and suggested to represent a biomarker of aging, is inserted into cell membranes, also in tissues exposed to light such as the skin. A general question about its physiological role is whether dolichol may play the role of a natural barrier for the noxious components of solar radiation. In order to clarify this point, we established that dolichol is a component of human sebum and we performed an " in vitro " study of the effects of UV radiation on the spectral properties of dolichol in isopropanol. Our data clearly show that, following UV irradiation, the optical absorption spectrum of dolichol undergoes remarkable modifications below 400 nm: a significant, strongly dose-dependent, increase of the optical density around 320 nm and a minor, very slightly dose-dependent, raise of the absorbance at 250 nm. On the contrary, UV irradiation causes only minor changes in HPLC profiles and the formation of photooxidative products c…

Modal cell volume and cellular RNA content were meaume was found to correlate with both culture replication rate and cellular RNA content. This observation suggests that cell volume changes may be related to the rate of cell division during ageing in vitro, and that both cell volume and RNA content may be closely controlled. There was no change in the relative proportions of the major rRNA species during the cultures' lifespan.
16436511	Senescence of human fibroblasts after psoralen photoactivation is mediated by ATR kinase and persistent DNA damage foci at telomeres.	aging	2006-04-??	Cellular senescence is a phenotype that is likely linked with aging. Recent concepts view different forms of senescence as permanently maintained DNA damage responses partially characterized by the presence of senescence-associated DNA damage foci at dysfunctional telomeres. Irradiation of primary human dermal fibroblasts with the photosensitizer 8-methoxypsoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) induces senescence. In the present study, we demonstrate that senescence after PUVA depends on DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) formation that activates ATR kinase. ATR is necessary for the manifestation and maintenance of the senescent phenotype, because depletion of ATR expression before PUVA prevents induction of senescence, and reduction of ATR expression in PUVA-senesced fibroblasts releases cells from growth arrest. We find an ATR-dependent phosphorylation of the histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX). After PUVA, ATR and gamma-H2AX colocalize in multiple nuclear foci. After several days, only few …
3071606	Nutritional support in sickle cell anemia: theoretical considerations.	aging	1988-02-??	Despite the clinical diversity of sickle cell anemia (HbSS) this autosomal recessive disorder, often characterized by a 6- to 20-fold increase in destruction rates of the red blood cells (RBC) without a corresponding increase in synthesis, is essentially a chronic hypermetabolic condition. The stress of HbSS produces caloric inefficiency and a marked increase in resting metabolic rate. Nitrogen metabolism is set at a higher than normal dietary intake, and data are still incomplete regarding the possibility that this genetic disorder may have special amino acid requirements. The physiologic needs for most vitamins and essential mineral elements are increased because of the elevated dietary requirements for energy and nitrogen. Many of these micronutrients, especially α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, retinol, zinc, and selenium, are free radical scavengers, and thus play crucial roles in retarding premature aging of RBCs caused by peroxidation of the membrane. Evaluation of the dietary requi…
17925003	Reduced oxygen tension attenuates differentiation capacity of human mesenchymal stem cells and prolongs their lifespan.	lifespan	2007-12-??	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into bone, fat, cartilage, tendon and other organ progenitor cells. Despite the abundance of MSC within the organism, little is known about their in vivo properties or about their corresponding in vivo niches. We therefore isolated MSC from spongy (cancellous) bone biopsies of healthy adults. When compared with the surrounding marrow, a fourfold higher number of colony-forming units was found within the tight meshwork of trabecular bone surface. At these sites, oxygen concentrations range from 1% to 7%. In MSC cultured at oxygen as low as 3%, rates for cell death and hypoxia-induced gene transcription remained unchanged, while in vitro proliferative lifespan was significantly increased, with about 10 additional population doublings before reaching terminal growth arrest. However, differentiation capacity into adipogenic progeny was diminished and no osteogenic differentiation was detectable at 3% oxygen. In turn, MSC that had …
29536466	Global Geriatric Assessment and In-Hospital Bleeding Risk in Elderly Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes: Insights from the LONGEVO-SCA Registry.	aging	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND: Bleeding risk scores have shown a limited predictive ability in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). No study explored the role of a comprehensive geriatric assessment to predict in-hospital bleeding in this clinical setting.    METHODS: The prospective multicentre  registry included 532 unselected patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS) aged 80 years or older. Comorbidity (Charlson index), frailty (FRAIL scale), disability (Barthel index and Lawton-Brody index), cognitive status (Pfeiffer test) and nutritional risk (mini nutritional assessment-short form test) were assessed during hospitalization. CRUSADE score was prospectively calculated for each patient. In-hospital major bleeding was defined by the CRUSADE classification. The association between geriatric syndromes and in-hospital major bleeding was assessed by logistic regression method and the area under the  (AUC).    RESULTS: Mean age was 84.3 years (SD 4.1), 61.7% male. Most patients …
7507566	Cloning of cDNAs with possible association with senescence and immortalization of human cells.	aging	1994-02-??	Normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) have a finite life span in vitro and have been used as a model system for the study of in vivo aging. Little is known about how changes in gene expression may affect the immortalization of human fibroblasts. We looked for cDNA clones whose mRNAs were differentially expressed between mortal senescent SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (B-32) and the immortal counterparts (B-32F) derived from B-32 cells. We identified three cDNA isolates by subtractive differential hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA probes from B-32 cells and B-32F cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these cDNA clones revealed that they were homologous to the human vimentin, a human mitochondrial gene and a human gene of unknown nature. Slot blot and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the former two were preferentially expressed in senescent B-32 cells and the last one was less expressed in B-32F immortal cells.
1844996	Muscle damage: nutritional considerations.	aging	1991-09-??	Most exercise results in some skeletal muscle damage. However, unaccustomed exercise and/or eccentric exercise can cause extensive damage. This exercise-induced muscle damage causes a response that can be characterized by a cascade of metabolic events. Within 24 to 48 hours, delayed onset muscle soreness and weakness, the most obvious manifestations of the damage, peak. Increased circulating neutrophils and interleukin-1 occurs within 24 hours after the exercise, with skeletal muscle levels remaining elevated for a much longer time. There is a prolonged increase in ultrastructural damage and muscle protein degradation as well as a depletion of muscle glycogen stores. These metabolic alterations may result in the increased need for dietary protein, particularly at the beginning of a training program that has a high eccentric component such as strength training. The delay in muscle repair and glycogen repletion following damaging exercise should cause coaches and athletes to allow an ade…
17606815	Associations of salivary cortisol with cognitive function in the Baltimore memory study.	aging	2007-07-??	CONTEXT: The stress responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can produce adverse effects on the brain. Previous studies have concluded that an elevated level of cortisol is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and decline in aging but have been limited by sex exclusion, restricted cognitive batteries, and small sample sizes.    OBJECTIVE: To examine associations among salivary cortisol metrics and cognitive domain scores in an urban adult population.    DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a longitudinal study involving 1140 Baltimore, Maryland, residents aged 50 to 70 years. Four salivary cortisol samples were obtained from 967 participants across 1 study visit (before, during, and after cognitive testing as well as at the end of the visit) from which 7 cortisol metrics were created. We examined associations of cortisol metrics with cognitive performance using multiple linear regression.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pe…
26648330	Intakes of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 and risk of depression in community-dwelling older adults: the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging.	aging	2016-03-??	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Depression can decrease quality of life and affect health outcomes in older population. We investigated whether different intake levels of folate, vitamin B6 and B12 were associated with a 3-year depression incidence among generally healthy, community-dwelling older men and women.    SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants in the Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging (NuAge), free of depression (that is, 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) <11) at baseline (N=1368; 74 ± 4 years old; 50.5% women), were screened annually for incident depression (GDS ⩾ 11) or antidepressant medication. Tertiles of intakes (food only and food+supplements) were obtained from the mean of three non-consecutive 24-h recalls at baseline. Sex-stratified multiple logistic regression models were adjusted for age, physical activity, physical functioning, stressful life events and total energy intake.    RESULTS: Over 3 years, 170 participants were identified as depressed. Women in the …
17534146	Posttranscriptional orchestration of an anti-apoptotic program by HuR.	aging	2007-06-01	The RNA-binding protein HuR can stabilize and/or regulate the translation of target mRNAs, thereby affecting the cellular responses to immune, proliferative, and damaging agents. Here, we discuss emerging evidence that HuR elicits a broad anti-apoptotic function through its influence on the expression of multiple target mRNAs. HuR was previously shown to bind to the mRNA encoding the apoptosome inhibitor prothymosin a(ProT alpha) and enhanced its translation and cytoplasmic abundance. More recently, HuR was shown to increase the stability of a target mRNA encoding the pro-survival deacetylase SIRT1. The discovery that HuR likewise binds to and promotes the expression of mRNAs encoding Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, two major anti-apoptotic effectors, strongly supports HuR's role as a key upstream coordinator of a constitutive pro-survival program.
26547052	Role of galactose in cellular senescence.	aging	2016-01-??	Cellular senescence has been proposed to play critical roles in tumor suppression and organismal aging, but the molecular mechanism of senescence remains incompletely understood. Here we report that a putative lysosomal carbohydrate efflux transporter, Spinster, induces cellular senescence in human primary fibroblasts. Administration of d-galactose synergistically enhanced Spinster-induced senescence and this synergism required the transporter activity of Spinster. Intracellular d-galactose is metabolized to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase. Galactokinase-deficient fibroblasts, which accumulate intracellular d-galactose, displayed increased baseline senescence. Senescence of galactokinase-deficient fibroblasts was further enhanced by d-galactose administration and was diminished by restoration of wild-type galactokinase expression. Silencing galactokinase in normal fibroblasts also induced senescence. These results suggest a role for intracellular galactose in the induction of ce…
24166073	Association of a modified frailty index with mortality after femoral neck fracture in patients aged 60 years and older.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: Frailty, a multidimensional syndrome entailing loss of energy, physical ability, cognition, and health, plays a significant role in elderly morbidity and mortality. No study has examined frailty in relation to mortality after femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.    QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We examined the association of a modified frailty index abbreviated from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to 1- and 2-year mortality rates after a femoral neck fracture. Specifically we examined: (1) Is there an association of a modified frailty index with 1- and 2-year mortality rates in patients aged 60 years and older who sustain a low-energy femoral neck fracture? (2) Do the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the modified frailty index can be a potential tool predictive of mortality and does a specific modified frailty index value demonstrate increased odds ratio for mortality? (3) Do any of the individual clinical deficits comprising th…
28049464	Quality of life among post-menopausal women due to oxidative stress boosted by dysthymia and anxiety.	aging	2017-??-03	BACKGROUND: Menopause is the onset of aging in women. During this process, some women experience physical changes that may impact upon their psychological and social status, also affecting their quality of life. Furthermore, several psychological changes following menopause have been shown to act as pro-oxidant, but the association between the psychological status that modify the quality of life and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determinate the relationship between oxidative stress with psychological disturbances, low self-esteem, depressive mood and anxiety, and quality of life in the postmenopausal women.    METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study with101 premenopausal and 101 postmenopausal women from Mexico City. As markers of oxidative stress we measured plasma lipoperoxide levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and total antioxidant status. We calculate a stress score as glo…
26767409	School education, physical performance in late midlife and allostatic load: a retrospective cohort study.	aging	2016-08-??	BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the social gradient in physical functioning are not fully understood. Cumulative physiological stress may be a pathway. The present study aimed to investigate the association between highest attained school education and physical performance in late midlife, and to determine to what extent cumulative physiological stress mediated these associations.    METHODS: The study is based on data from the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank (CAMB; n=5467 participants, aged 48-62 years, 31.5% women). School education was measured as highest examination passed in primary or secondary school (3 categories). Cumulative stress was operationalised as allostatic load (AL), and measured as the number of biological parameters (out of 14) in which participants scored in the poorest quartile. Physical performance included dynamic muscle performance (chair rise ability, postural balance, sagittal flexibility) and muscle strength (jump height, trunk extension and flexi…
8287361	Aromatic DNA adducts in brain tumors by 32P-postlabeling analysis.	aging	1993-10-15	DNA from human brain tumor samples was analysed by the 32P-postlabeling technique for the presence of aromatic DNA adducts. Thirteen out of 16 samples showed low levels of adducts at 0.14-3.53 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides. Inter-individual variations in the patterns of these aromatic adducts were observed. On the other hand, none of 5 brain samples from epilepsy patients revealed any evidence of such adducts. The data demonstrated the presence of low level, large molecule aromatic DNA adducts in malignant brain tissues and these adducts may either result from environmental exposure to an undetermined genotoxic agent or from the aging process.
27163722	Dedifferentiated face processing in older adults is linked to lower resting state metabolic activity in fusiform face area.	aging	2016-??-01	We used multimodal brain imaging to examine possible mediators of age-related neural dedifferentiation (less specific neural activation) to different categories of stimuli that had been shown in previous research. Specifically, we examined resting blood flow and brain activation in areas involved in object, place and face perception. We observed lower activation, specificity, and resting blood flow for older adults (OA) than younger adults (YA) in the fusiform face area (FFA) but not in the other regions of interest. Mediation analyses further revealed that FFA resting state blood flow mediated age differences in FFA specificity, whereas age differences in visual and cognitive function and cortical thickness did not. Whole brain analyses also revealed more activated voxels for all categories in OA, as well as more frontal activation for faces but not for the other categories in OA than YA. Less FFA specificity coupled with more frontal activation when passively viewing faces suggest th…
21336965	A common polymorphism in the UCP3 promoter influences hand grip strength in elderly people.	aging	2011-06-??	The reduction of muscle mass in the elderly is widely studied as one of the most important landmark of human aging. This process, which occurs for the decay of the correct energetic and protein metabolism, has important functional consequences on individual functionality but also on metabolic adaptation and immunological response to environmental challenges. Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene is expressed in skeletal muscle where it regulates fatty acid metabolism, redox state, and ROS formation. Considering the importance of these processes in aging, we studied two variants of the UCP3 gene in a large, aged (age range 65-105) population of southern Italy verifying if these variants were correlated to hand grip strength, the most reliable measure of muscle decay. We found that a previously described functional polymorphism, rs1800849, located in the promoter region of the UCP3 gene, has a significant impact on hand grip strength. In fact, the carriers of rs1800849 T allele showed higher …
15890475	The retrograde response links metabolism with stress responses, chromatin-dependent gene activation, and genome stability in yeast aging.	longevity, aging	2005-07-18	Yeast can be used as a model to understand the impact mitochondria have on aging in higher organisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction increases with replicative age in yeast, and this is associated with the induction of the retrograde response. This intracellular signaling pathway from the mitochondrion to the nucleus results in changes in the expression of metabolic and stress genes, which adapt the yeast cell to the loss of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity by providing alternate anaplerotic sources of biosynthetic precursors. The induction of the retrograde response increases longevity. Paradoxically, it also leads to the production of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, which cause yeast demise. The deleterious effects of these circles are mitigated by the retrograde response, which increases longevity in part due to this effect and partly due to other activities. Rtg2p is the retrograde signal transducer proximal to the mitochondrion, and it interacts with several proteins in relayi…
3402555	Effect of procaine on cultivated human WI-38 fibroblasts.	aging	1988-??-??	Procaine is a local anesthetic, also used in experimental gerontology and has been tested in cultivated human WI-38 fibroblasts. This molecule was found to enhance growth rate and cell densities in actively dividing cultures. As the cells aged, however, this stimulatory effect diminished and finally vanished. In a long term experiment the enhancement of growth of procaine treated cultures was finally replaced by a toxic effect even at low concentration. The amount of the thermolabile enzyme found in phase III cells did not change when procaine was added to the culture medium. In this cellular aging model, procaine behaved like a metabolic stimulator of actively dividing cells but not as an "antiaging" molecule as it is sometimes assumed.
26476175	Stability of ethyl glucuronide in hair reference materials after accelerated aging.	aging	2015-12-??	Two different hair reference materials, one produced from authentic hair displaying an ethyl glucuronide (EtG) content of about 25 pg/mg and one obtained by fortification of blank hair to an EtG level of 85 pg/mg were submitted to accelerated aging between 4 °C and 60 °C for periods between one and 24 months. Subsequently, the EtG content was determined in the aged samples and untreated reference samples stored at -22 °C under repeatability conditions following the so-called isochronous approach. The EtG content remained stable even at 40 °C for 24 months and at 60 °C over six months. This is in contrast to many organic analytes contained in trace concentrations in diverse matrices. A slight but significant increase of the recovered EtG in case of authentic hair samples having been exposed for 24 months between 4 °C and 60 °C may be due to a temperature-driven process that allows increased recoveries of the physiologically embedded EtG.
18249079	In vitro and in vivo effects of zinc on cytokine signalling in human T cells.	aging	2008-05-??	Aging is associated with changes in the immune response which are collectively called immunosenescence. The changes mainly affect the adaptive immune response and especially the T cell-mediated cellular immune response. There are a few data indicating that the cytokine signalling in T cells is altered with aging. Zinc has been specifically shown to have potent immunomodulatory effects. The aim of the present work was to study the IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine signalling and activation induced cell death (AICD) in T cells of elderly subjects of various ages and from various European countries. These experiments were performed in the frame of European Community financed project called ZINCAGE "Nutritional zinc, oxidative stress and immunosenescence: biochemical, genetic and lifestyle implications for healthy ageing", assembling 17 laboratories from 8 countries through Europe. The study was carried out in a total of 312 French and a group of 201 (26 from Italy, 63 from France, 57 from Greece, 24…
30384145	Telomere length and its association with hippocampal gray matter volume in antipsychotic-naïve/free schizophrenia patients.	aging	2018-??-30	Accelerated ageing processes are postulated to underlie schizophrenia pathogenesis. This postulate is supported by observations of reduced telomere length in schizophrenia patients. Hippocampus, one of the most important brain regions implicated in schizophrenia, is shown to atrophy at a faster rate in aging. In this study, telomere length (TL) was measured in 30 antipsychotic-naive/free schizophrenia patients and 60 healthy controls using quantitative PCR assay. Hippocampus volume was measured using voxel-based morphometry. Schizophrenia was associated with differential TL between sexes [Status × Sex; F(1,85) = 5.9, p = 0.017, η = 0.065]. Male schizophrenia patients had significantly lower relative TL than female patients [F(1,85) = 7.38, p = 0.008], while such sex difference was not observed in healthy controls [F(1,85) = 0.16, p = 0.69]. Schizophrenia patients showed a significant sex-by-telomere interaction with both right & left hippocampus, with male patients showing positive ass…
18709289	Skin aging.	aging	2008-06-??	There are two main processes that induce skin aging: intrinsic and extrinsic. A stochastic process that implies random cell damage as a result of mutations during metabolic processes due to the production of free radicals is also implicated. Extrinsic aging is caused by environmental factors such as sun exposure, air pollution, smoking, alcohol abuse, and poor nutrition. Intrinsic aging reflects the genetic background and depends on time. Various expressions of intrinsic aging include smooth, thinning skin with exaggerated expression lines. Extrinsically aged skin is characterized by photo damage as wrinkles, pigmented lesions, patchy hypopigmentations, and actinic keratoses. Timely protection including physical and chemical sunscreens, as well as avoiding exposure to intense UV irradiation, is most important. A network of antioxidants such as vitamins E and C, coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, glutathione, and others can reduce signs of aging. Further anti-aging products are three gene…
22291992	Neural correlates of the difference between working memory speed and simple sensorimotor speed: an fMRI study.	aging	2012-??-??	The difference between the speed of simple cognitive processes and the speed of complex cognitive processes has various psychological correlates. However, the neural correlates of this difference have not yet been investigated. In this study, we focused on working memory (WM) for typical complex cognitive processes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during the performance of an N-back task, which is a measure of WM for typical complex cognitive processes. In our N-back task, task speed and memory load were varied to identify the neural correlates responsible for the difference between the speed of simple cognitive processes (estimated from the 0-back task) and the speed of WM. Our findings showed that this difference was characterized by the increased activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the increased functional interaction between the right DLPFC and right superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the local gray matter volume of the righ…
21138591	Effect modification of air pollution on Urinary 8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine by genotypes: an application of the multiple testing procedure to identify significant SNP interactions.	aging	2010-12-07	BACKGROUND: Air pollution is associated with adverse human health, but mechanisms through which pollution exerts effects remain to be clarified. One suggested pathway is that pollution causes oxidative stress. If so, oxidative stress-related genotypes may modify the oxidative response defenses to pollution exposure.    METHODS: We explored the potential pathway by examining whether an array of oxidative stress-related genes (twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs in nine genes) modified associations of pollutants (organic carbon (OC), ozone and sulfate) with urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxygunosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative stress among the 320 aging men. We used a Multiple Testing Procedure in R modified by our team to identify the significance of the candidate genes adjusting for a priori covariates.    RESULTS: We found that glutathione S-tranferase P1 (GSTP1, rs1799811), M1 and catalase (rs2284367) and group-specific component (GC, rs2282679, rs1155563) significantly or mar…
22159421	WRN helicase regulates the ATR-CHK1-induced S-phase checkpoint pathway in response to topoisomerase-I-DNA covalent complexes.	aging	2011-12-01	Checkpoints are cellular surveillance and signaling pathways that coordinate the response to DNA damage and replicative stress. Consequently, failure of cellular checkpoints increases susceptibility to DNA damage and can lead to profound genome instability. This study examines the role of a human RECQ helicase, WRN, in checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage. Mutations in WRN lead to genomic instability and the premature aging condition Werner syndrome. Here, the role of WRN in a DNA-damage-induced checkpoint was analyzed in U-2 OS (WRN wild type) and isogenic cells stably expressing WRN-targeted shRNA (WRN knockdown). The results of our studies suggest that WRN has a crucial role in inducing an S-phase checkpoint in cells exposed to the topoisomerase I inhibitor campthothecin (CPT), but not in cells exposed to hydroxyurea. Intriguingly, WRN decreases the rate of replication fork elongation, increases the accumulation of ssDNA and stimulates phosphorylation of CHK1, which relea…
22672282	Modulation of telomere binding proteins: a future area of research for skin protection and anti-aging target.	aging	2012-06-??	Telomere shortening is considered as one of the main characteristics of cellular aging by limiting cellular division. Besides the fundamental advances through the discoveries of telomere and telomerase, which were recognized by a Nobel Prize, telomere protection remains an essential area of research. Recently, it was evidenced that studying the cross-talks between the proteins associated with telomere should provide a better understanding of the mechanistic basis for telomere-associated aging phenotypes. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on telomere shortening, telomerase activity, and the essential role of telomere binding proteins in telomere stabilization and telomere-end protection. This review highlights the capacity of telomere binding proteins to limit cellular senescence and to maintain skin tissue homeostasis, which is of key importance to reduce accelerated tissue aging. Future studies addressing telomere protection and limitation of DNA damage response in huma…
18582489	Cytokeratin-related loss of cellular integrity is not a major driving force of human intrinsic skin aging.	aging	2008-10-??	The contribution of extracellular matrix components to intrinsic skin aging has been investigated thoroughly, however, there is little information as to the role of the cytoskeletal proteins in this process. Therefore, we compared the expression of the constituents of the cytoskeleton, keratins 1-23 (K1-K23) as well as junction-plakoglobin (JUP), alpha-tubulin (TUBA), and beta-actin (ACTB) in human foreskins of both young (mean 6.4 years) and aged (mean 54.3 years) individuals. By applying RNA expression analysis to intrinsically aged human skin, we demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the genes for K1, K3, K4, K9, K13, K15, K18, K19 and K20 are downregulated in aged skin, K5 and K14 are unchanged, and K2, K16 and K17 are upregulated in aged skin. The mRNA data were confirmed on the protein level. This diverse picture is in contrast to other cytoskeletal proteins including components of the desmosome (JUP), microtubuli (TUBA) and microfilaments (ACTB) - often regarded as house-keeping …
12586632	Ectopic hTERT expression extends the life span of human CD4+ helper and regulatory T-cell clones and confers resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.	aging	2003-06-01	Human somatic cells have a limited life span in vitro. Upon aging and with each cell division, shortening of telomeres occurs, which eventually will lead to cell cycle arrest. Ectopic hTERT expression has been shown to extend the life span of human T cells by preventing this telomere erosion. In the present study, we have shown that ectopic hTERT expression extends the life span of CD4+ T helper type 1 or 2 and regulatory T-cell clones and affected neither the in vitro cytokine production profile nor their specificity for antigen. In mixed cell cultures, ectopic hTERT-expressing clones were found to expand in greater numbers than untransduced cells of the same replicative age. This ectopic hTERT-induced growth advantage was not due to an enhanced cell division rate or number of divisions following T-cell receptor-mediated activation, as determined in carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling experiments. Moreover, the susceptibility to activation-induced cell deat…
21480590	Impact of concentration of ellagitannins in oak wood on their levels and organoleptic influence in red wine.	aging	2011-05-25	Some wood substances such as ellagitannins can be extracted during wine aging in oak barrels. The level of these hydrolyzable tannins in wine depends of some parameters of oak wood. Their impact on the organoleptic perception of red wine is poorly known. In our research, oak staves were classified in three different groups according to their level of ellagitannins estimated by NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy) online procedure (Oakscan). First, the ellagitannin level and composition were determine for each classified stave and an excellent correlation between the NIRS classification (low, medium and high potential level of ellagitannin) and the ellagitannin content estimated by HPLC-UV was found. Each different group of NIRS classified staves was then added to red wine during its aging in a stainless tank, and the extraction and evolution of the ellagitannins were monitored. A good correlation between the NIRS classification and the concentration of ellagitannins in red wine aging in c…
8043384	Aging of the skin connective tissue: how to measure the biochemical and mechanical properties of aging dermis.	aging	1994-04-??	The connective tissue of the skin is composed mostly of collagen and elastin. Collagen makes up 70-80% of the dry weight of the skin and gives the dermis its mechanical and structural integrity. Elastin is a minor component of the dermis, but it has an important function in providing the elasticity of the skin. During aging, the synthesis of collagen gradually declines, and the skin thus becomes thinner in protected skin, especially after the seventh decade. Several factors contribute to the aging of the skin. In several hereditary disorders collagen or elastin are deficient, leading to accelerated aging. In cutis laxa, for example, elastin fibers are deficient or completely lacking, leading to sagging of the skin. Solar irradiation causes skin to look prematurely aged. Especially ultraviolet radiation induces an accumulation of abnormal elastotic material. These changes are usually observed after 60 years of age, but excessive exposure to the sun may cause severe photoaging as early a…
23460089	General phenolic characterisation, individual anthocyanin and antioxidant capacity of matured red wines from two Portuguese Appellations of Origins.	aging	2013-08-15	BACKGROUND: The main aim of this work was to evaluate the general phenolic composition, individual anthocyanin content and total antioxidant capacity from 20 commercial matured red wine samples (vintage from 2005 to 2008) produced in two Appellations of Origin from the north of Portugal: Douro and Dão.    RESULTS: The results showed that the levels of general phenolic compounds, individual anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity in the 20 matured red wine samples analysed differed significantly. In addition, matured red wine samples aged in oak wood had a lower total individual anthocyanin content (from 13.85 to 56.79 mg L(-1), averaging 46.13 mg L(-1)) than wines aged in bottle (from 25.93 to 252.82 mg L(-1), averaging 94.17 mg L(-1)). The total antioxidant capacity values of the analysed wines showed quantitative differences among the values obtained from each antioxidant method applied as well as differences in the range of variation, especially for the values obtained by the DPPH met…
17244303	Comparison of the flexural strength of five adhesive resin cements.	aging	????-??-??	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The increased use of adhesive resin cements in bonded prosthetic restorations has led to restorations debonding under function.    PURPOSE: This investigation evaluated the differences in the flexural strength of new adhesive resin cements as a function of specimen age and storage condition.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four new dual-cure cements were compared to C/B Metabond. Twenty specimens of each of the five cements were prepared in a rectangular glass mold (25 x 2 x 2 mm). The new cements were light-activated with a 550 mW/cm(2) lamp for 80 seconds on both the top and bottom surfaces. The auto-cured cement was allowed to set according to manufacturer's directions. Half the specimens were tested immediately after curing while the other half were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 30 days. A three-point bending test was performed using an Instron at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance and Scheffé tests ( p <…
26586908	iNOS-dependent sweating and eNOS-dependent cutaneous vasodilation are evident in younger adults, but are diminished in older adults exercising in the heat.	aging	2016-02-01	Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) contributes to sweating and cutaneous vasodilation during exercise in younger adults. We hypothesized that endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) mediate NOS-dependent sweating, whereas eNOS induces NOS-dependent cutaneous vasodilation in younger adults exercising in the heat. Further, aging may upregulate inducible NOS (iNOS), which may attenuate sweating and cutaneous vasodilator responses. We hypothesized that iNOS inhibition would augment sweating and cutaneous vasodilation in exercising older adults. Physically active younger (n = 12, 23 ± 4 yr) and older (n = 12, 60 ± 6 yr) adults performed two 30-min bouts of cycling at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (400 W) in the heat (35°C). Sweat rate and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) were evaluated at four intradermal microdialysis sites with: 1) lactated Ringer (control), 2) nNOS inhibitor (nNOS-I, NPLA), 3) iNOS inhibitor (iNOS-I, 1400W), or 4) eNOS inhibitor (eNOS-I, LNAA). In younger…
23438140	Comparison of noncross-linked and cross-linked hyaluronic acid with regard to efficacy of the proliferative activity of cutaneous fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro.	aging	2013-03-??	BACKGROUND: Intradermal application of hyaluronic acid (HA) in varying chain length and cross-linking density is used routinely for hydrodynamic volume replacement of the extracellular matrix to reduce the clinical effects of aging.    OBJECTIVES: In vitro data show that via receptors of the hyaladherin group hyaluronic acid has additionally direct or indirect effects on cells. In the case of native noncross-linked HA, it has been proved that the proliferative and metabolic activity of cutaneous fibroblasts can be increased. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these effects can be proved also for cross-linked HA and how these effects can be quantified for different preparations.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect on proliferative activity in cultures of native cutaneous fibroblasts and keratinocytes was investigated for noncross-linked HA, for noncross-linked HA with added glycerol, for HA that was stabilized in the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups per inner esterification, …
15741268	Sex hormone suppression reduces resting energy expenditure and {beta}-adrenergic support of resting energy expenditure.	aging	2005-06-??	Resting energy expenditure (REE) decreases with aging and may decrease in women as a result of the menopause, potentially contributing to weight gain. REE has been observed to fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, suggesting regulation by sex hormones. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of suppressing estrogen and progesterone on REE. Fourteen premenopausal women, 29 +/- 5 yr old (mean +/- sd), were studied in the midluteal menstrual phase (ML) and after 6 d of GnRH antagonist therapy (GnRHant) administered in the follicular menstrual phase. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after a 12-h fast and again during beta-adrenergic blockade to determine sympathetic nervous system (SNS) support of REE. Treatment with GnRHant significantly decreased REE (1405 +/- 42 vs. 1334 +/- 36 kcal/d, mean +/- se, ML vs. GnRHant; P = 0.002). Additionally, SNS blockade tended to alter REE more during ML than during GnRHant (-19 +/- 10 vs. 5 +/- 11 kcal/d; P = 0.1…
19448716	Mechanisms of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.	aging	2009-06-??	Acute exercise initiates rapid cellular signals, leading to the subsequent activation of proteins that increase gene transcription. The result is a higher level of mRNA expression, often observed during the recovery period following exercise. These molecules are translated into precursor proteins for import into preexisting mitochondria. Once inside the organelle, the protein is processed to its mature form and either activates mitochondrial DNA gene expression, serves as a single subunit enzyme, or is incorporated into multi-subunit complexes of the respiratory chain devoted to electron transport and substrate oxidation. The result of this exercise-induced sequence of events is the expansion of the mitochondrial network within muscle cells and the capacity for aerobic ATP provision. An understanding of the molecular processes involved in this complex pathway of organelle synthesis is important for therapeutic purposes, and is a primary research undertaking in laboratories involved in …
24393208	Comparative immunohistochemical assessment of cutaneous cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme expression in chronological aging and photoaging.	aging	2014-02-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Skin aging can be classified into chronological aging and photoaging. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may be involved in ultraviolet-induced inflammation, photocarcinogenesis and the aging process. Studies done focused on assessing COX-2 expression after acute ultraviolet exposure and in photocarcinogenesis. Comparative assessment of COX-2 expression in chronological aging and photoaging was not previously studied. We aimed to compare COX-2 expression in chronological aging and photoaging.    METHODS: Sixty participants were included (20 with chronological aging, 20 with photoaging, and 20 non-skin-aged contributors as controls). Fitzpatrick skin type and Glogau's photoaging type were assessed. Immunohistochemical evaluation of COX-2 was done in biopsies from sun-protected skin in the chronological aging and control groups, and from sun-exposed skin in the photoaging group.    RESULTS: Comparison between each two groups showed a high statistically significant difference, w…
2782845	Mitochondrial antigenic structure and enzyme activity in ageing human diploid fibroblasts.	lifespan	????-??-??	It has been proposed that cellular ageing may be caused by loss of mitochondrial function due to the action of free radicals. To investigate this hypothesis, antigenic structures of the mitochondrial inner membrane/matrix and of the outer mitochondrial membrane of human diploid fibroblasts were monitored by immunoblotting at four stages during cellular lifespan in vitro. At the same time, specific activities of the enzymes oligomycin-sensitive ATPase (O-S ATPase), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were assayed to assess the functional capacity of cellular oxidative phosphorylation and of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. No changes were found with ageing in inner mitochondrial membrane-associated matrix components, or in the activities of O-S ATPase and MDH. However GDH activity increased significantly with ageing in vitro, possibly indicating greater amino acid utilization for energy production in older cells. There was loss of an outer mitochondrial membrane an…
24422589	Extraction, evolution, and sensory impact of phenolic compounds during red wine maceration.	aging	2014-??-??	We review the extraction into wine and evolution of major phenolic classes of sensory relevance. We present a historical background to highlight that previously established aspects of phenolic extraction and retention into red wine are still subjects of much research. We argue that management of the maceration length is one of the most determining factors in defining the proportion and chemical fate of phenolic compounds in wine. The extraction of anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins (PAs) is discussed in the context of their individual extraction patterns but also with regard to their interaction with other wine components. The same approach is followed to present the sensory implications of phenolic and phenolic-derived compounds in wine. Overall, we conclude that the chemical diversity of phenolic compounds in grapes is further enhanced as soon as vacuolar and pulp components are released upon crushing, adding a variety of new sensory…
10515576	Age-dependent increase of collagenase expression can be reduced by alpha-tocopherol via protein kinase C inhibition.	aging	1999-10-??	Total protein kinase C (PKC) activity in human skin fibroblasts increases during in vivo aging as a function of the donor's age. During in vitro aging protein kinase C activity is also increased, as a function of cell passage number. Using PKC isoform specific antibodies, we demonstrate that the increase in total PKC activity is mainly due to the PKC a isoform. PKC alpha protein expression increased up to 8 fold during in vivo aging. Collagenase (MMP-1) gene transcription and protein expression also increased with age, concomitant with the increase in protein kinase C alpha. Furthermore, alpha-tocopherol, which inhibits protein kinase C activity, is able to diminish collagenase gene transcription without altering the level of its natural inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1. We propose that an aging program leads to increased protein kinase C alpha expression and activity. This event would induce collagenase overexpression followed by increased collagen degradation.…
7160447	Ganglioside changes during cell aging in human diploid fibroblast TIG-1.	aging	1982-??-??	Gangliosides of human diploid fibroblast, TIG-1, derived from fetal lung were analyzed during cell aging. The major gangliosides of TIG-1 cells were GM3 and GD3. During cell aging, GM3 and other gangliosides were decreased or below detection level. Lipid-bound sialic acid per mg protein was 2 micrograms at the early, middle and late passages, but between the middle and late passage it was twofold higher than the other passages.
21289261	Progesterone prevents sleep disturbances and modulates GH, TSH, and melatonin secretion in postmenopausal women.	aging	2011-04-??	CONTEXT: A number of neuroactive progesterone metabolites produce sedative-like effects. However, the effects of progesterone administration on sleep are not well characterized.    OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a 3-wk progesterone administration on sleep architecture and multiple hormonal profiles.    SUBJECTS: Eight healthy postmenopausal women, 48-74 yr old, without sleep complaints or vasomotor symptoms. None was on hormone replacement therapy. They did not take any medication for ≥ 2 months.    DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. For 3 wk, subjects took daily at 2300 h a capsule of either 300 mg of progesterone or placebo. Sleep was polygraphically recorded during the last two nights, and blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 24 h.    RESULTS: During the first night (no blood sampling), sleep was similar in both conditions. Under placebo, blood sampling procedure was associated with marked sleep disturbances, which were considerably …
26996820	Perlecan expression influences the keratin 15-positive cell population fate in the epidermis of aging skin.	aging	2016-??-??	The epidermis is continuously renewed by stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Basal keratinocytes append the dermal-epidermal junction, a cell surface-associated, extracellular matrix that provides structural support and influences their behaviour. It consists of laminins, type IV collagen, nidogens, and perlecan, which are necessary for tissue organization and structural integrity. Perlecan is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan known to be involved in keratinocyte survival and differentiation. Aging affects the dermal epidermal junction resulting in decreased contact with keratinocytes, thus impacting epidermal renewal and homeostasis. We found that perlecan expression decreased during chronological skin aging. Our in vitro studies revealed reduced perlecan transcript levels in aged keratinocytes. The production of in vitro skin models revealed that aged keratinocytes formed a thin and poorly organized epidermis. Supplementing these models with purified perlecan reversed the pheno…
17472436	Mitochondrial dysfunction accounts for the stochastic heterogeneity in telomere-dependent senescence.	lifespan, aging	2007-05-??	Aging is an inherently stochastic process, and its hallmark is heterogeneity between organisms, cell types, and clonal populations, even in identical environments. The replicative lifespan of primary human cells is telomere dependent; however, its heterogeneity is not understood. We show that mitochondrial superoxide production increases with replicative age in human fibroblasts despite an adaptive UCP-2-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling. This mitochondrial dysfunction is accompanied by compromised [Ca(2+)]i homeostasis and other indicators of a retrograde response in senescent cells. Replicative senescence of human fibroblasts is delayed by mild mitochondrial uncoupling. Uncoupling reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation, slows down telomere shortening, and delays formation of telomeric gamma-H2A.X foci. This indicates mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as one of the causes of replicative senescence. By sorting early senescent (SES) cells from young prolife…
6226851	Erythrocyte anomalies in Down's syndrome.	aging	1983-08-??	It is suggested that anomalies in Down's syndrome /DS/ erythrocyte /E/ features are due to accelerated E aging. This, in turn, can be conditioned by augmented free-radical exposure. Accelerated cell aging in DS may be the reason for immune system derangement.
29579543	IGFBP-3 plays an important role in senescence as an aging marker.	aging	2018-04-??	Aging study requires aging markers to measure the degree of aging process. The aging markers such as senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), lipofuscin, telomere, p53 and p16 have been known in aging study until now. Therefore, we investigated the role of genes and proteins related to aging in young, senescent and HO-induced old cells to develop a novel aging marker involved in aging mechanism. After cellular aging was compared in young, senescent and HO-induced old cells using SA-β-galactosidase staining assay, the expression level of genes and proteins in senescent and HO-induced old cells were compared and analyzed with those of young cells using RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. First of all, the senescent cells and the cells aged by HO showed higher level of SA-β-galactosidase staining than young cells. In particular, the expression level of IGFBP-3 was decreased in senescent and HO-induced old cells compared with young cells. Moreover, the senescent …
9541134	A comparative analysis of the proteins between the fibroblasts from Werner's syndrome patients and age-matched normal individuals using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.	aging	1998-01-30	Werner's syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing symptoms of premature aging. The fibroblasts of WS patients have a shorter life-span than normal fibroblasts. We analyzed the fibroblast proteins from three WS patients and from three age-matched normal individuals using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image processing. The expressions of 12 proteins were shown to be augmented or suppressed in WS fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts: 11 of 12 spots on the electrophoresis gel of WS fibroblasts were denser than the corresponding spots of normal individual fibroblasts, while the remaining one spot was fainter in WS fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts. The abundance of these proteins were compared to those of the corresponding proteins from normal fibroblasts at various cell passages in vitro reported in the TMIG-2DPAGE database. The result shows that the change in the protein patterns in in vitro aging did not necessarily correspond to the change in WS fi…
29311034	Caregiving for Uganda's elders with disability: Using cross-sectional surveillance data to identify healthcare service gaps in low- and middle-income settings.	aging	2018-??-??	BACKGROUND: Disability is highly prevalent in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), but there is a relative dearth of disability and caregiving research from LMICs.    OBJECTIVE: To examine type and severity of disability experienced by individuals 60 years and older, caregivers and type of caregiving assistance, and the interrelationships between sociodemographic factors involved in Uganda.    METHODS: Data was collected from two Eastern Ugandan districts using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Data on availability of caregiver was analyzed for 816 participants with disability. Group comparisons and regression analyses examined differences based on caregiver availability.    RESULTS: Approximately 66% of individuals with disability had a caregiver. The mean age of those with a caregiver (74.7 ± 8.9 years) was statistically significantly (p = .0004) higher than that of individuals without caregiver (72.4 ± 8.2 years). Significant differences based on caregiver availability…
1447307	Similar, but not identical, modulation of expression of extracellular matrix components during in vitro and in vivo aging of human skin fibroblasts.	aging	1992-12-??	Regulation of the synthesis of procollagen and other extracellular matrix components was examined in human skin fibroblasts obtained from donors of various ages, from fetal to 80 years old (in vivo aged), and in fetal fibroblasts at varying passage levels (in vitro aged). Growth rates and saturation densities of fibroblasts decreased with increasing age of the donor and after passage 20 of fetal fibroblasts. The rates of collagen and proteoglycan synthesis also decreased during both types of aging to about 10-25% of the rate in early passage fetal fibroblasts, whereas the synthesis of total noncollagenous proteins was not greatly affected. Decreased collagen synthesis in both types of aging was correlated with lower steady-state levels of mRNAs for the two subunits of type I procollagen mRNA, although their regulation was not coordinate. Type III collagen mRNA levels also declined in both types of aging. The concentration of fibronectin mRNA also decreased during in vitro aging but mor…
2416282	Aging changes of riboflavin concentration and glutathione reductase activity in erythrocytes.	aging	1985-10-??	Aged erythrocytes obtained by fractionation using gradient centrifugation with Dextran 40, showed lower glutathione reductase activity and riboflavin content than young cells. However, both young and old cells displayed almost the same increase in enzyme activity upon addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide to the test hemolysate in vitro. The lipid peroxide content in the cell membranes showed no consistent changes with aging.
28803240	Impact of Body Site, Age, and Gender on the Collagen/Elastin Index by Noninvasive in vivo Vertical Two-Photon Microscopy.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Extrinsic and intrinsic skin aging is subject to constant remodeling and degradation processes, primarily in components of the extracellular matrix. While collagen fibers thin out during the aging process, the amorphous elastin fibers accumulate. These are essential formative components of the dermis. So far, these processes have been detected in vertical histological sections of invasive biopsies and recently in noninvasive horizontal scans.    METHODS: In this pilot study, a modified noninvasive 2-photon microscope was applied to measure the collagen/elastin index of skin in vivo. The obtained images permit an immediate vertical survey and allow a conclusion on the dermal composition at once. The collagen/elastin index was quantified by the second harmonic to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID) depending on volunteers' age (18-66 years), gender, and body area.    RESULTS: The highest SAAID was measured at the volar forearm as compared to the abdominal SAAI…
20053132	Stimulation of cell proliferation and expression of matrixmetalloproteinase-1 and interluekin-8 genes in dermal fibroblasts by copper.	aging	2010-06-??	Copper is essential to wound healing as well as a widespread environmental pollutant, with skin aging potential. Wound healing and skin aging are facilitated by matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP), which remodel the extracellular matrix, and interleukin-8 (IL-8), linked with copper. This research investigated the mechanism to copper's role in wound healing or skin aging by regulation of MMP-1 and IL-8 genes. It examined the dose-responsive effects of copper on MMP-1, -2, and -9 activities; MMP-1 and IL-8 gene regulation at protein, mRNA, and promoter levels; tissue inhibitor of matrixmetalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) expression; and cell proliferation. Copper stimulated cell proliferation and the expression of MMP-1 and IL-8 genes at the protein, mRNA, and promoter levels, indicating transcriptional regulation, without significantly altering TIMP-1. The research suggests that copper facilitates wound healing as well as skin aging via the induction of MMP-1 expression, with limiting MMP effect a…
21367876	Associations between longitudinal changes in serum estrogen, testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone and changes in benign urologic outcomes.	aging	2011-04-01	Some men have rapid increases in benign prostatic enlargement and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and it is not clear how sex steroid hormones contribute to the rates of change in these urologic outcomes. Therefore, the authors conducted a population-based cohort study of 648 men residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1990 to 2007, to examine associations between baseline sex steroid hormones, the rate of change in these hormones, and the rates of change in LUTS, maximum urinary flow rate, and prostate volume. Annual changes in hormone levels and urologic outcomes were calculated using mixed-effects regression models. Associations between hormone variables and rates of change in urologic outcomes were assessed with linear regression models. Higher baseline estradiol levels and rapid declines in estradiol over time were associated with rapid increases in LUTS and rapid decreases in maximum flow rate. Lower baseline bioavailable testosterone levels and more rapid declines in bi…
15292449	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 regulates both the exonuclease and helicase activities of the Werner syndrome protein.	aging	2004-??-??	Werner syndrome (WS) is a genetic premature aging disorder in which patients appear much older than their chronological age. The gene mutated in WS encodes a nuclear protein (WRN) which possesses 3'-5' exonuclease and ATPase-dependent 3'-5' helicase activities. The genomic instability associated with WS cells and the biochemical characteristics of WRN suggest that WRN plays a role in DNA metabolic pathways such as transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Recently we have identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a new WRN interacting protein. In this paper, we further mapped the interacting domains. We found that PARP-1 bound to the N-terminus of WRN and to the C-terminus containing the RecQ-conserved (RQC) domain. WRN bound to the N-terminus of PARP-1 containing DNA binding and BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains. We show that unmodified PARP-1 inhibited both WRN exonuclease and helicase activities, and to our knowledge is the only known WRN protein partner that in…
8787948	Clinical pharmacokinetics of zopiclone.	aging	1995-12-??	Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone hypnotic agent. It possesses a chiral centre and is commercially available as a racemic mixture. Methods involving high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis (CE) and high performance thin layer chromatography have been developed for the quantitation of zopiclone and its 2 main metabolites in biological samples. For the chiral determination of the enantiomers of zopiclone and its metabolites, HPLC and CE methods are available. After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability of approximately 80%. The plasma protein binding of zopiclone has been reported to be between 45 and 80%. Zopiclone is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva and breast milk. Zopiclone is partly metabolised in the liver to form an inactive N-demethylated derivative and an active N-oxide metabolite. In addition, approximately 50% of the administ…
24526512	Assessment of a multi-marker risk score for predicting cause-specific mortality at three years in older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND: Due to increasing co-morbidity associated with aging, heart failure (HF) has become more prevalent and heterogeneous in older individuals, and non-cardiovascular (CV) mortality has increased. Previously, we defined a multi-marker modality that included cystatin C (CysC), troponin T (TnT), and age. Here, we validated this multi-marker risk score by evaluating its predictions of all-cause mortality and CV mortality in an independent population of older individuals with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).    METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 124 patients, median age 73 years, that had HFrEF. We determined all-cause mortality and CV mortality at a 3-year follow-up. We compared the risk score to the N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for predicting all-cause mortality and CV mortality.    RESULTS: High risk scores were associated with both all-cause mortality (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-8.1, p < 0.001) and CV mortality (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7…
6549127	Electrophoretic and lectin-binding properties of glycopeptides released from the membrane during "in vitro" aging of human erythrocytes.	aging	1984-??-??	During in vitro aging of human erythrocytes sialopeptides are lost from the membrane in a process which appears to act on glycophorins. This glycopeptide material can be purified by affinity chromatography on Wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, as glycophorin does. The electrophoretic behaviour of the purified material suggests that the glycopeptide comes from the breakdown of the domain of glycophorin exposed on the surface of the membrane. The binding properties toward Phaseolus vulgaris E lectin indicate that the only N-linked sugar chain of glycophorin is present in the sialopeptide released from the membrane; therefore we can argue that the glycophorin breakdown during in vitro aging of red cell takes place beyond the 26th residue of the sequence, and probably quite near the lipid bilayer.
3619637	In vitro aging of red blood cells and lipid peroxidation.	aging	1987-??-??	Incubating isolated erythrocytes in phosphate buffered saline supplied with sufficient glucose (20 mM) for several days resulted in methemoglobin formation and decrease in glycolytic and antioxidant enzyme activities. Volatile hydrocarbon gas release (ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane) and loss of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid (20:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) in the erythrocyte membrane indicated possible involvement of peroxidative reactions in cellular aging processes.
26112694	Interaction of intraocular lenses with fibronectin and human lens epithelial cells: Effect of chemical composition and aging.	aging	2015-12-??	The aim of this study is to investigate in vitro interactions between hydrophobic acrylate intraocular lenses (IOLs) and their biological environment. The influence of lens chemical composition and aging on fibronectin (FN) adsorption and on IOLs cytotoxicity on human lens epithelial cells was examined. Cytotoxicity of acrylate monomers used in IOLs manufacture was also investigated. Four different IOLs were included in the study: Acrysof(®), Tecnis(®), EnVista(®), and iSert(®). Implants were artificially aged in a xenon arc chamber to simulate 2 years of light exposure. Fibronectin adsorption on IOL surface was quantified using ELISA and correlated to surface roughness determined with AFM. Direct contact cytotoxicity was determined with the MTT assay and cell morphology was observed with light microscopy. Results showed that fibronectin adsorption did not differ significantly among IOLs, whatever their chemical composition. Moreover, aging conditions did not impact fibronectin adsorpt…
16827688	Age and skin structure and function, a quantitative approach (II): protein, glycosaminoglycan, water, and lipid content and structure.	aging	2006-08-??	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aging process has been studied with fervor recently, given our shifting demographics. As age's effects are so manifest in the skin's appearance, structure, mechanics, and barrier function, it is not surprising that much effort has been made in research to better understand them. Quantitative measurements permitted by bioengineering have allowed us to objectively and precisely study aging skin. These overviews piece together the immense amounts of information that have emerged from recent technological advances in dermatological research in order to develop a unified understanding of the quantitative effects of age on skin.    METHODS: We performed a literature search on age-related changes in protein, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), water, and lipid content and structure, searching Pub-med, Em-Base, Science Citation Index, and the UCSF dermatological library's collection of books on the topic of aging skin.    RESULTS: Collagen becomes sparser and less soluble in intri…
4058067	Total LD and isozyme variations during in vitro fibroblast aging with a discussion of its theoretical implication.	aging	????-??-??	Dermal fibroblast cultures were obtained from 18 patients. Total lactic dehydrogenase (LD) and LD isozymes were determined after each population doubling (PD). The lactic dehydrogenase was assayed by the method of Wacker, Ulmer and Vallee. The isozymes were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Some investigators have reported conflicting results as to the quantity of LD produced during in vitro aging. These researchers sampled a small number of PDs. We found that the total LD varied with each PD. A distinct isozyme pattern has been described for adult, fetal and neoplastic fibroblasts. We have found all three patterns occurring during the in vitro aging of our normal diploid fibroblasts. In spite of our asynchronous population of cells the LD and its isozymes continually fluctuate. An asynchronous population of cells would be expected to produce a dampening of the total LD. In order to explain this finding we speculate a synchrony is established in a "gated" entrance from subcycle Gq into …
4021559	Membrane glycoprotein changes during the senescence of normal human diploid fibroblasts in culture.	aging	1985-05-31	The plasma membrane is intimately involved in a variety of cellular phenomena and may play an important role in the aging of human cells in culture. Significant differences in human diploid fibroblast surface glycoproteins were observed with in vitro aging. Senescent cells bound more concanavalin A (Con A) than young cells and exhibited two distinct classes of binding sites. Cell surfaces of senescent cells incorporated less labelled mannose and more labelled fucose and glucosamine than young cell surfaces. Membranes prepared from older cells were also less effective than membrane preparations from young cells in incorporating mannose from GDP-mannose into a group of oligolipid intermediates, required for the synthesis of glycoproteins with asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. These results demonstrate novel quantitative changes in membrane structure and lectin reactivity in aging human diploid fibroblasts, which must reflect the fundamental physiological modifications in the cell that …
8215584	The effect of reactive oxygen species on the biosynthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in cultured human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	1993-??-??	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility that the biological changes observed in connective tissue matrix components of photoaging skin may be induced by an alteration of biosynthesis in fibroblasts damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated the effect of ROS induced by xanthine and the xanthine oxidase system on the biosynthesis of connective tissue matrix components, collagen and glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. ROS decreased collagen production and increased GAGs synthesis. Interestingly, these changes were consistent with the biological alterations of connective tissue matrix components observed in photoaging skin. Moreover, catalase and alpha-tocopherol completely prevented the ROS-induced alterations of collagen and GAGs biosynthesis, whereas superoxide dismutase had no effect on the ROS-induced changes. These results suggest that ROS may be one of the factors which cause the biological changes of connective tissue ma…
21464540	Expression of cyclophilin A and CD147 during skin aging.	aging	2011-03-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of cyclophilin A (CypA) and CD147 in the process of skin aging.    METHODS: Twenty cases of tissue samples from junior group(<15 years old), middle age group(30-40 years old)or old age group (>65 years old) were collected from photophobic and exposal parts of skin, respectively. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) were carried out to semi-quantitatively detect the expression level of CyPA and CD147.    RESULTS: IHC demonstrated that both CyPA and CD147 were expressed in both photophobic and exposal parts of normal human skin in all 3 groups. The expression levels of both CyPA and CD147 were increased with increase in age. There were significant differences in both CyPA and CD147 expression among 3 groups (P<0.05). CyPA and CD147 were also positively correlated in all 3 groups. Similar results were achieved by ISH.    CONCLUSION: The interaction between CD147 and CyPA might play an important role in the process of skin aging.
8482345	Enhanced expression of fibronectin during in vivo cellular aging of human vascular endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts.	aging	1993-04-??	Vascular endothelial cells are thought to play an important role in human aging as their senescence and/or detachment from vascular wall contribute to arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure in elderly persons. Since fibronectin is necessary for cell attachment and spreading and its increased expression has been reported in aging fibroblasts, we checked its expression in aortic endothelial cells aged in vivo. We found that the steady-state level of fibronectin expression increases with increasing donor age, while the labeling index of cultured cells decreases with age. The increased level of fibronectin expression correlated well with an increase in cell area. To explore whether these changes were a reflection of exhaustion of proliferation potential in vivo, we examined fibronectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells aging in vitro. Very similar results were obtained, supporting the idea that vascular endothelial cells age in vivo by using up division potential. When…
2959572	Red blood cell aging--membrane skeleton alteration and IgG receptor expression.	aging	1987-??-??	Investigations were performed on aging of erythrocytes. It has been assumed that structural changes of the membrane result after exposer of the cells to certain environmental influences in vivo or in vitro. Cell aging can be connected with varying combinations of membrane structure disturbances. It is postulated that the messenger which signals membrane structure lesion is involved in a mechanism given by the expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptor sites which bind autologous IgG1 and IgG3. This antibodies are cytophilic for macrophages. The performed studies demonstrated that an intact molecular arrangement of the membrane skeleton is not only a supposition for stabilization of the membrane asymmetry but also for IgG receptor masking to prevent an early elimination of the red blood cells from the organism.
2077476	Insulin receptors in children's erythrocytes. Study on aging cells.	aging	????-??-??	Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the red cell aging process on insulin receptor binding. In erythrocytes from 8 children with high reticulocyte count and 9 healthy age-matched subjects we studied insulin receptor binding in correlation with pyruvate kinase (PK) activity and creatine levels. Moreover maximum 125I-insulin bound % and PK activity were tested in four red cell fractions of different age. Our data show a significant correlation between 125I-insulin bound and either PK activity or creatine levels. In vitro experiments on red cell fractions of different age (as tested by creatine levels) evidence a lower decay of PK activity than insulin bound (p less than 0.05). Our results indicate that creatine content is the best marker of red cell age for insulin receptor studies.
27562218	Declined Expression of Histone Deacetylase 6 Contributes to Periodontal Ligament Stem Cell Aging.	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: Identification of regulators for aging-associated stem cell (SC) dysfunctions is a critical topic in SC biology and SC-based therapies. Periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC), a kind of dental mesenchymal SC with dental regeneration potential, ages with functional deterioration in both in vivo and ex vivo expansion. However, little is known about regulators for PDLSC aging.    METHODS: Expression changes of a potential regulator for PDLSC aging, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), were evaluated within various models. Senescence-associated phenotypic and functional alternations of PDLSC in loss-of-function models for HDAC6 were examined using HDAC6-specific pharmacologic inhibitors or RNA interference-based knockdown. Involvement of p27 in HDAC6-associated aging was demonstrated by its acetylation and stability changes along with overexpression or functional inhibition of HDAC6.    RESULTS: Expression of HDAC6 decreased significantly in replicative senescence and induced SC agin…
16803990	Proteasomal oscillation during mild heat shock in aging human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2006-05-??	Augmentation of proteasome machinery is emerging as a significant gerontomodulatory consequence of hormetic stimulation, such as mild heat stress. This study describes the phenomenon we term hormetic proteasomal oscillation, wherein mildly heat-stressed human fibroblasts (41 degrees C, 1 h) display an adaptation response pattern in proteasome activity. Remarkably, such response appears to be diverse in severely heat-stressed or senescent fibroblasts. This proteasomal oscillation, as an innate cellular reaction to heat and aging, however, is independent of 20S proteasome protein levels and nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transactivation.
16155929	Long term metabolic arrest and recovery of HEK293 spheroids involves NF-kappaB signaling and sustained JNK activation.	longevity, aging	2006-02-??	Understanding how cells withstand a depletion of intracellular water is relevant to the study of longevity, aging, and quiescence because one consequence of air-drying is metabolic arrest. After removal of medium, HEK293 spheroids with intracellular water content of approximately 65% survived partial vacuum, with antistatic control, for weeks in the dark at 25 degrees C. In contrast, only a limited exposure of monolayers to air was lethal; the mitochondrion being a target of this stress. The pathways activated during the long-term arrest and recovery of spheroids depended on both NF-kappaB signaling and sustained JNK activation. A cyclical cascade, presumably originating from an intercellular stress signal, led to endogenous cytokine production (TNF-alpha, IL-1b, and IL-8) and propagation of the cellular stress signal through the co-activation of NF-kappaB and JNK. Increased levels of downstream pathway signaling members, specifically Gadd45beta, c-jun, and ATF3 were observed, as was a…
8292683	Sleep after spousal bereavement: a study of recovery from stress.	aging	1993-12-01	AIM: In this study, we compared repeated measures of electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep and subjective sleep quality in nondepressed, spousally bereaved elders and a healthy control group, in order to search for possible psychobiological correlates of bereavement not confounded by concurrent major depression.    METHOD: Laboratory-based EEG sleep studies and measures of subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were repeated at 3, 6, 11, 18, and 23 months after spousal bereavement in a study group of 27 elderly volunteers. Data were compared with similar measures from a control group of 27 nonbereaved subjects recorded on three occasions 1 year apart. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), using age as a covariate, examined effects due to time on selected variables in the bereaved group, as well as effects due to group, time, and group-by-time interactions in the experimental and control subjects.    RESULTS: Bereaved and control groups showed consisten…
25234834	Increase of stratifin triggered by ultraviolet irradiation is possibly related to premature aging of human skin.	aging	2014-10-??	Although ultraviolet (UV) rays cause premature aging of human skin, which is called photoaging, its detailed mechanisms are not known. Stratifin (SFN), a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, is secreted by keratinocytes on human skin, and has an effect on gene expression in other cells. In this study, the association of SFN with the mechanism of photoaging was investigated. The effect of UVB irradiation on SFN expression in epidermal keratinocytes was examined by in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, the effects of SFN on epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were examined. SFN mRNA expression and protein levels increased significantly in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. SFN significantly decreased filaggrin and serine palmitoyltransferase mRNA expression in epidermal keratinocytes and hyaluronan synthase 2 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts. In addition, it was reconfirmed that SFN induces the downregulation of collagen content through changes of COL-1, MMP-1 and MMP-2 m…
3128035	Membrane-bound immunoglobulins increase during red blood cell aging.	aging	1988-??-??	A flow cytofluorimetric method was used to detect the immunoglobulin molecules present on human red blood cells. Normal human erythrocytes were separated into seven fractions of increasing mean age by density centrifugation on discontinuous gradients. Some biochemical and morphological properties of these cells were determined as well as their IgG content. The results obtained suggest that IgG binding during red cell aging is a cumulative process.
14567995	Cellular aging-dependent decrease in cholesterol in membrane microdomains of human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	2003-11-01	Recently it has been shown that cholesterol plays indispensable roles in the function of cholesterol-rich microdomains (rafts), such as in ligand-mediated signal transduction. Using a perfringolysin O derivative (BCtheta) that binds selectively to cholesterol in rafts without causing membrane damage (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 (2001) 4926), we have investigated the effect of in vitro replicative aging of human diploid fibroblasts, TIG-1, on the distribution of plasma membrane cholesterol. The amount of BCtheta-labeled membrane cholesterol decreased during replicative aging of TIG-1 cells, whereas total cholesterol increased somewhat. The relationship was confirmed by double staining with BCtheta and senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase, a biomarker of senescent cells. Cell fractionation experiments revealed decreases in both cholesterol in rafts and a raft marker, flotillin, during replicative aging. In addition, hydroxyurea-induced prematurely senescent cells also showed a lowe…
30390250	The Role of IGF-1 Signaling in Skeletal Muscle Atrophy.	aging	????-??-??	Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a key anabolic growth factor stimulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling which is well known for regulating muscle hypertrophy. However, the role of IGF-1 in muscle atrophy is less clear. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms via which IGF-1 signaling is implicated in several conditions of muscle atrophy and via which mechanisms protein turnover is altered. IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling stimulates the rate of protein synthesis via p70S6Kinase and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase and negatively regulates protein degradation, predominantly by its inhibiting effect on proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. Caspase-dependent protein degradation is also attenuated by IGF/PI3K/Akt signaling, whereas evidence for an effect on calpain-dependent protein degradation is inconclusive. IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling reduces during denervation-, unloading-, and joint immobilization-induced muscle atrophy, whereas IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling se…
8304781	Age- and sex-dependent change in stratum corneum sphingolipids.	aging	1993-??-??	We measured six stratum corneum sphingolipid species (ceramides 1-6) in 26 males and 27 females, and found a significant change in their percentage composition only among female subjects of different age groups. There was a significant increase in ceramide 1 and 2 with a corresponding decrease in ceramide 3 and 6 from prepubertal age to adulthood. Thereafter the ratio of ceramide 2 to total sphingolipids decreased with age in contrast to ceramide 3 which showed an increase. Such a pattern of change in the aging population is different from that observed in scaly skin experimentally induced by tape stripping. The present results suggest a significant influence of female hormones on the composition of stratum corneum sphingolipids. Moreover, the different patterns of change in sphingolipid composition of stratum corneum lipids between scales from inflammatory skin and those from aged skin also suggest that epidermal biosynthesis of sphingolipids is influenced by epidermal proliferative a…
77824	The iron status in healthy individuals aging from 18-25 years.	aging	1978-??-??	The haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, transferrin and serum iron values of a group of 65 healthy young people aging from 18-25 years were determined. Ferritin in serum was quantitated by radioimmunoassay to determine the usefulness of this assay in reflecting iron stores of healthy people.
25503577	Continuous irradiation with a 633-nm light-emitting diode exerts an anti-aging effect on human skin cells.	aging	2015-02-??	Accumulating evidence has indicated that the light source emitted from light‑emitting diode (LED) has a potential anti-aging effect on human skin. Studies using single and interval LED irradiation have documented such effects; however, to the best of our knowledge, the anti-aging effects of continuous LED irradiation have not yet been investigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that continuous irradiation with a 633±3-nm LED exerted anti-aging effects in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments. More specifically, irradiation with a 633-nm LED for 2 days increased the synthesis of type 1 procollagen and decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 and MMP2 in skin fibroblasts. In addition, irradiation with a 633-nm LED decreased the expression levels of inflammatory genes, such has cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-1-α (IL-1α) in keratinocytes. Furthermore, a 14-day LED irradiation moderately increased keratinocyte proliferation. Using human skin explants, w…
17358508	Force balance and membrane shedding at the red-blood-cell surface.	aging	2007-01-05	During the aging of the red-blood cell, or under conditions of extreme echinocytosis, membrane is shed from the cell plasma membrane in the form of nanovesicles. We propose that this process is the result of the self-adaptation of the membrane surface area to the elastic stress imposed by the spectrin cytoskeleton, via the local buckling of membrane under increasing cytoskeleton stiffness. This model introduces the concept of force balance as a regulatory process at the cell membrane and quantitatively reproduces the rate of area loss in aging red-blood cells.
20603227	The how, when, and why of the aging signals appearing on the human erythrocyte membrane: an atomic force microscopy study of surface roughness.	aging	2010-12-??	We recently developed an atomic force microscopy-based protocol to use the roughness of the plasma membrane of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) as a morphological parameter, independently from the cell shape, to investigate the membrane-skeleton integrity in healthy and pathological cells. Here we apply the method to investigate a complex physiological phenomenon, the RBCs aging, that plays a major role in the regulation of the RBCs' turnover. The aging, monitored morphologically and biochemically, has been accelerated and modulated by preventing oxidative stresses as well as the effects of proteases and divalent cations, and by artificially consuming the intracellular adenosine triphosphate. The collected data evidence that the progression of aging causes a drastic decrease of the measured roughness that is diagnostic of a progressive, adenosine triphosphate-dependent alteration of the membrane-skeleton properties. Finally, the degree of reversibility of such effects has been inve…
1829049	Spontaneous degradation and enzymatic repair of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in aging red cell proteins analyzed by computer simulation.	longevity	1991-??-??	The inherent instability of proteins may be a limiting factor in the longevity of an organism. Spontaneously altered forms may themselves be toxic, or their accumulation may simply crowd out normal proteins. Two of the major sites of nonenzymatic degradation are aspartyl and asparaginyl residues, which are susceptible to an intramolecular reaction that results in the deamidation of asparaginyl residues and the isomerization and racemization of both aspartyl and asparaginyl residues. In all eucaryotic cells examined so far, an enzyme is present that can recognize at least some of these damaged sites and initiate their conversion to normal forms. This enzyme, the type II protein carboxyl methyltransferase, catalyzes the methyl esterification of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues, enabling them to spontaneously revert to their normal L-aspartyl configurations. In this study, we utilize data on the rates of spontaneous degradation and enzymatic methylation in a computer program that sim…
9055241	Effects of in vitro cellular aging on alkaline phosphatase, cathepsin activities and collagen secretion of human periodontal ligament derived cells.	aging	1996-11-13	It is believed that the degree of periodontal tissue breakdown and tooth loss increase with age. In periodontal tissues which are gingiva, periodontal ligament (PL), alveolar bone and tooth cementum, the PL which is soft connective tissue, lies between the tooth cementum and alveolar bone, having the primary function of tooth support, and maintaining the homeostasis of supporting tissues, as well as providing the healing process. We therefore investigated the effects of in vitro cellular aging on alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cathepsin activities and collagen secretion from human PL cells obtained from 18-23 year-old patients' teeth. ALP, cathepsin activities and collagen secretion may play important roles in the remodeling and maintaining of periodontal tissues. To investigate the life span of PL cells, the cells were sequentially subcultivated. The maximum population doubling level of the PL cells in the present experiment was 22-25 passages. Investigating some important biological act…
21145908	Overexpression of PaParp encoding the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase of Podospora anserina affects organismal aging.	lifespan, aging	????-??-??	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a diverse group of proteins present in all multicellular eukaryotes. They catalyze the NAD(+)-dependent modification of proteins with poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation plays a key role in a plethora of processes including DNA repair, tumor progression and aging. Here we report that PaPARP, the single protein with a PARP catalytic domain, in the fungal aging model Podospora anserina, indeed displays a NAD(+)-dependent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. While unable to select a PaParp deletion strain, we succeeded in the generation of PaParp overexpressors. Biochemically these strains are characterized by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and a lowered ATP content. They show an increased sensitivity against different stressors including the DNA damaging agent phleomycin, the reactive oxygen generator paraquat, and the apoptosis inducer farnesol. PaParp overexpressors are impaired in growth, in pigmentation and fertility, and have …
20621990	Urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and cognitive function in Puerto Rican adults.	aging	2010-08-01	DNA oxidative stress has been suggested as an important pathogenic mechanism in cognitive impairment and dementia. With baseline data collected from 2004 to 2008, the authors examined whether urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of global DNA oxidation, was associated with cognitive function in a sample of 1,003 Puerto Rican adults, aged 45-75 years, living in Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding area. Cognitive function was measured by using a battery of 7 tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination, word list learning, digit span, clock drawing and figure copying, Stroop, and verbal fluency tests. The primary outcome was a global cognitive score, averaging standardized scores across all cognitive tests. A higher 8-OHdG concentration was significantly associated with lower global cognitive scores, after adjustment for age, education, status of the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE), and other covariates (P(trend) = 0.01). The difference in the global score, compar…
7305986	Age-dependent decay of cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase in human erythrocytes.	aging	1981-01-15	Age-dependent decrease in cytochrome b5 was observed in erythrocytes from both a normal person and a patient with hereditary methaemoglobinaemia without neurological symptoms. With aging, concentrations of cytochrome b5 in erythrocytes from the patient were almost the same as those in the control. Age-dependent decrease in cytochrome b5 reductase activity in the control erythrocytes was also shown; however, the reductase activity was very low in erythrocytes from the patient over the whole age range. Our studies show that methaemoglobin content of erythrocytes seems to be dependent on the content of cytochrome b5 in the cells, both in the control subject and in the patient.
6993800	Alterations in prostaglandin synthesis during senescence of human lung fibroblasts.	aging	1980-04-??	Prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by human embryo lung fibroblasts in culture was determined with increasing population doubling. These cultures synthesized PGE2, PGF2 alpha, PGI2 (prostacyclin) and TXA2 (thromboxane A2) in response to fetal bovine serum or ascorbic acid. Changes in prostaglandin synthesis by these cells during aging were observed in response to serum or ascorbic acid. These included a shift from the synthesis of PGI2 and PGE2 to TXA2 and PGF2 alpha and finally to PGF2 alpha alone. We also observed a marked increase during aging in the release of precursor fatty acid from lipid stores upon stimulation with ascorbic acid. A parallel decrease in the ability to convert the released fatty acid to prostaglandins was detected.
6453260	Changes in cell-surface glycosaminoglycans in human diploid fibroblasts during in vitro aging.	aging	1981-02-??	Changes in glycosaminoglycans during in vitro aging were investigated in human diploid fibroblasts. The cells were found to produce predominantly hyaluronate and smaller amounts of chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Accumulation of heparan sulfate on the cell surface was notable during aging. Total glycosaminoglycan production in preconfluent culture did not change with population doubling level (PDL), while in confluent culture a decline in glycosaminoglycan production was observed. In contrast with this, heparan sulfate on the cell surface increased as a function of PDL in both confluent and preconfluent cultures. The distribution pattern of heparan sulfate in medium and cell surface indicated that the increase in heparan sulfate on the cell surface could be attributed to an increased accumulation on the cell surface, but not to an elevated production. Thus, we conclude that the increased accumulation of heparan sulfate on the cell sur…
18704747	Deregulation of versican and elastin binding protein in solar elastosis.	aging	2009-04-??	Several changes in skin appearance including loss of elasticity and wrinkle formation are associated with alterations in the composition of the dermal extracellular matrix. They are induced by intrinsic aging or by environmental factors such as UV light referred to as photoaging. A general characteristic in the histology of photoaged skin is the accumulation of elastotic material suggesting impaired formation and/or massive breakdown of elastic fibres. In order to shed light on some of the underlying mechanisms we tracked two of the major players in elastic fibre formation in different skin conditions: EBP (elastin binding protein), a regulator of elastic fibre assembly and VER (versican), a component of functional elastic fibres as well as non-functional elastotic material. Using quantitative RT-PCR on skin biopsies we found that the expression levels of VER and EBP were unaltered during intrinsic skin aging. Upon acute UV stress however, VER and EBP showed different regulation patter…
17379755	High-intensity exercise elicits the mobilization of senescent T lymphocytes into the peripheral blood compartment in human subjects.	aging	2007-07-??	Clonal expansion of T lymphocytes in response to antigenic stimulation is a fundamental process of adaptive immunity. As a consequence of clonal expansion, some T lymphocytes acquire a senescent phenotype, fail to replicate in response to further antigenic stimulation, and express the killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) and/or CD57. Physical exercise elicits a mobilization of large numbers of T lymphocytes into the bloodstream from peripheral lymphoid compartments, but the frequency of senescent cells in the mobilized population is not known. Eight male runners (age: 29 +/- 9 yr; maximal O2 uptake 62 +/- 6 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) performed an intensive treadmill-running protocol at 80% maximal O2 uptake to volitional exhaustion. Blood lymphocytes isolated before, immediately after, and 1 h after exercise were assessed for cell surface expression of KLRG1, CD57, CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, and lymphocyte subset markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56) by flow cytometry. The percentage of a…
24534523	Metabolic syndrome is associated with poor memory and executive performance in elderly community residents: the PROOF study.	aging	2014-11-??	OBJECTIVE: Aging is associated with a loss of cognitive performance and an increasing occurrence of cardiovascular events. Moreover, cardiovascular risk factors are linked to cognitive impairment and dementia. Whereas individual components of metabolic syndrome (Met S) have been reported to be linked to cognitive decline and dementia, there are very few studies on Met S as a whole. The present study aims to assess the relationship between Met S and its components and cognitive functioning in a cohort of elderly non-demented community residents.    DESIGN: Population-based cohort study (PROOF study). Cross-sectional analysis.    PARTICIPANTS: Dementia-free community-dwellers aged 65.    MEASURES: The PROOF participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery at baseline. Summary cognitive measures including memory, attention, and executive performance were created by converting the individual test results to Z scores and computing the average scores within each domain. Each of…
8212965	The impaired transcription factor AP-1 DNA binding activity in lymphocytes derived from subjects with some symptoms of premature aging.	aging	1993-??-??	The study of human disorders known as premature aging syndromes may provide insight into the mechanisms of cellular senescence. The main feature of cellular senescence in vitro is cessation of cell proliferation. Down syndrome (DS) and neuronal ceroid-lypofuscinosis (NCL) are clinically characterized by the premature onset of numerous features normally associated with human aging. Phytohemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes derived from DS subjects showed a statistically significant diminished proliferation capacity in comparison with lymphocytes derived from NCL and healthy individuals. We demonstrated, by applying the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, slightly impaired AP-1 DNA binding activity in NCL lymphocytes and strong in DS ones. Our results showed that the same molecular mechanisms of proliferation cessation could exist in fibroblasts characterized by replicative senescence and in lymphocytes derived from individuals with premature aging syndromes (Down).
10579635	Histone variants of H2A and H3 families are regulated during in vitro aging in the same manner as during differentiation.	aging	1999-09-??	In a previous communication, we showed that the H2A.1/H2A.2 histone variant ratio decreases in a linear manner during the in vitro aging of human diploid fibroblasts. This ratio is known to decrease in the same manner in progressive stages of development and in the process of differentiation, and is thus considered to be a biochemical marker for differentiation. A detailed analysis of the synthesis of H2A and H3 histone variants as a function of cumulative population doublings in the same in vitro cell system is presented in this study. Quantitative analysis of these variants in the G0 phase, synchronized fibroblasts has shown that their relative amount in chromatin, as well as their biosynthesis rate, change during in vitro aging of human diploid fibroblasts, revealing both up-and down-regulation of certain variants as a function of cumulative population doublings. Furthermore, we show by morphometric studies employing the seven distinct fibroblast morphotypes, as described by the Bay…
21176034	Prefrontal and paralimbic metabolic dysregulation related to sustained attention in euthymic older adults with bipolar disorder.	aging	2010-12-??	OBJECTIVE: Reports of sustained attention deficits in the euthymic phase of bipolar disorder have been variable, and have yet to be related to cerebral metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated relationships between cognitive performance deficits and resting cerebral metabolism in euthymic older adults with bipolar disorder.    METHODS: Sixteen older (mean age 58.7 years) euthymic outpatients with bipolar disorder (10 type I, 6 type II; 44% female) and 11 age-matched healthy controls received resting positron emission tomography with (18) fluorodeoxyglucose and, within 10 days, the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II, a commonly used measure of sustained attention and inhibitory control.    RESULTS: Bipolar disorder patients had significantly more omission errors (z = 2.53, p = 0.01) and a trend toward more commission errors (z = 1.83, p < 0.07) than healthy controls. Relative to healthy controls, among bipolar disorder subjects commission errors were more strongly related to …
20157511	WRN helicase defective in the premature aging disorder Werner syndrome genetically interacts with topoisomerase 3 and restores the top3 slow growth phenotype of sgs1 top3.	aging	2009-02-05	Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder characterized by genomic instability. The WRN gene defective in WS encodes a protein with both helicase and exonuclease activities that interacts with proteins implicated in DNA metabolism. To understand its genetic functions, we examined the ability of human WRN to rescue phenotypes associated with sgs1, the sole RecQ helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. WRN failed to rescue sgs1 sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate or replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, suggesting divergent functions of human and yeast RecQ helicases. However, physiological expression of WRN in sgs1 top3 restored top3 slow growth phenotype, whereas no effect on growth was observed with wild-type or sgs1 strains. Slow growth of WRN-transformed sgs1 top3 correlated with an elevated population of large-budded cells with undivided nuclei, indicating restoration of cell cycle delay in late S/G2 characteristic of top3. WRN helicase but not exonucle…
25676694	Low to moderate doses of infrared A irradiation impair extracellular matrix homeostasis of the skin and contribute to skin photodamage.	aging	2015-??-??	Human skin is daily exposed to sun rays, which include not only ultraviolet radiation, but also an important quantity of infrared (IR) radiation. In the past few years, many publications have underlined the negative impact of IR radiation on the human skin, particularly when the skin and/or the cells are exposed to high sun irradiance and significant doses of IR. In the present study, we demonstrate, in vitro on normal human fibroblasts, that even under low irradiance with single or very few repeated doses, infrared A irradiation (IRA) produces free radicals, triggers major changes in the expression of the type I collagen and elastin network, impairs the dermal-epidermal junction, upregulates several matrix metalloproteinases and has an impact on the expression of key genes of the extracellular matrix. We conclude that chronic or discretionary exposure to IRA could play a role that is more important than expected in premature skin aging.
3602618	Red cell age effects on metabolism and oxygen affinity in humans.	aging	1987-05-??	Hemoglobin-oxygen-binding characteristics and essential influencing factors were investigated in human erythrocytes of different age separated by density gradient centrifugation. The most important age-dependent changes of the cell milieu are losses of K+, organic phosphates and water; the latter also leads to an increased concentration of negative charges on Hb. This augments the Donnan effect, which is only partly compensated for by a decrease of DPG-. The oxygen dissociation curve of the oldest fraction (P50 23.4 mm Hg) is shifted to the left compared to young cells (P50 29.2 mm Hg), and Hills 'n' is decreased (old cells 2.31, young cells 2.74). The Bohr effect for CO2 increases in the old population (BCCO2 at 50% SO2 -0.63 and -0.24 for old and young erythrocytes, respectively). This effect is less pronounced for the Bohr coefficients for lactic acid (delta BCLac 0.09). Most cell age-dependent alterations of Hb-O2-binding (including BCCO2) are explainable by opposite alterations of…
23800248	A new objective histological scale for studying human photoaged skin.	aging	2014-05-??	BACKGROUND: A quantitative understanding of the histological alteration of the skin is important for assessing the severity of photoaging.    METHODS: We performed Elastica-van Gieson staining and immunohistochemistry for decorin on 34 facial skin sections. We evaluated the alteration of collagen fibers and decorin (a modulator for collagen fibrillogenesis), according to the 5 grades of morphological change in elastic fibers that was established by Kligman (1969). The objectivity of a stage (Stages I-VI), which was established in this study, was evaluated using weighted kappa statistical analysis based on the degree of agreement in stage determination by 11 observers using a blind procedure. Correlation between the crow's-feet-area wrinkles grades of another 26 women and stages was also analyzed.    RESULTS: The initial alteration of elastic fibers was observed in the deep dermis. Decorin was not detected in very severely altered skin. Based on the combination of changes in the elastic…
8297932	FRAR course on laboratory approaches to aging. Cellular aging, in vitro and in vivo.	aging	1993-08-??	Human cells grown in culture exhibit exponential growth provided they are regularly provided with fresh medium. This exponential growth is limited, and although the cells eventually cease to divide, they remain viable for long periods of time. Such a culture is deemed to be "senescent", but it is not clear whether this reflects the growth pattern of cells in vivo. Considerable evidence has been obtained to correlate cell senescence in vitro with aging in vivo, but there is no convincing evidence that any organ or tissue ages as a result of senescence of its individual cells. Recently gained insights into the control of cell proliferation through studies of cell senescence, and the relevance of cell senescence as a strategy to prevent carcinogenesis are of particular interest.
3497817	Internalization and processing of epidermal growth factor in aging human fibroblasts in culture.	aging	1987-??-??	Tissue culture lines established from newborn human skin were used as a model system to study the effects of the mitogenic hormone epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the aging process. These cells demonstrated a finite life span in culture which is presumed to be related to the in vivo aging process. Fibroblasts aged in vitro demonstrated a reduction in their ability to respond to the mitogenic effects of EGF as compared to these cells at an earlier population doubling level (PDL). This decreased responsiveness was not due to a decrease in the number of EGF receptors/cells, as cells at late PDL possessed either the same or more EGF receptors than cells at an earlier PDL. In Rat-1 fibroblasts, 125I-labeled EGF is internalized following binding to the surface receptor, and is transported through intracellular organelles where it undergoes a series of modifications which result in acidification of the EGF (Matrisian et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3047). It is not known whether this acidi…
6687842	Phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes by autologous monocytes: requirement of membrane-specific autologous IgG for immune elimination of aging red blood cells.	aging	1983-05-??	The role of membrane-bound IgG present on the membrane of senescent erythrocytes in immune eliminations of aging red cells was investigated. Phagocytosis of populations of red blood cells (RBC) of different ages by autologous monocytes was assessed both by direct phagocytosis and by induction of microsomal heme oxygenase. Removal of IgG from older RBCs inhibited their phagocytosis; in contrast, preincubation of neuraminidase-treated young or in vitro aged RBCs with IgG eluted from old cells led to phagocytosis of RBCs treated by autologous monocytes. It was also found that the Fc portion of membrane-bound IgG is essential for the elimination of senescent cells; less than 15% of old heat-inactivated RBCs coated with F(ab)2 fragment of membrane-bound IgG were phagocytosed. In contrast, more than 50% of old heat-inactivated RBCs coated with heat-eluted IgG were phagocytosed by autologous monocytes. A possible mechanism of elimination of aged cells is discussed.
9165309	Effect of reactive oxygen species on the elastin mRNA expression in cultured human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	1997-??-??	The effects of ultraviolet A (UVA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by a xanthine and xanthine oxidase (XOD) system, on the mRNA expression of elastin, were investigated using cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis using synthesized 530 base cDNA probe for elastin with primers derived from exon 10 and 1 of human elastin. UVA irradiation did not affect elastin mRNA expression. In contrast, ROS resulted in a dose-related increase in the level of elastin mRNA up to 1.8-fold in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Catalase, used as scavenger, essentially prevented the ROS induced alterations in elastin mRNA levels. These results suggest that ROS produced in the dermis may contribute to elastin deposition observed in photoaging skin.
21376714	Association of exonic variants of Klotho with metabolic syndrome in Asian Indians.	aging	2011-05-12	BACKGROUND: Klotho, an anti-aging gene, is a functional candidate for metabolic syndrome. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association of the genetic variants of Klotho with metabolic syndrome and surrogates of insulin resistance in Asian Indians.    METHODS: We recruited 428 clinically normal subjects for the study. Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism.    RESULTS: Significant and borderline associations of the KL-VS (OR=15.88 [95%CI, 2.56-98.70], p=0.003) and C1818T (OR=0.28 [95%CI, 0.07-1.07], p=0.063) variants of the Klotho gene, respectively, were observed with metabolic syndrome. The association of the KL-VS variant with metabolic syndrome could be linked to its observed influence on high blood glucose (OR=6.92 [95% CI=1.75-27.44], p=0.006), high blood pressure (OR=5.21 [95%CI=1.00-38.43], p=0.046), insulin resistance (OR=3.59, [95%CI=1.01-12.79], p=0.048) and trend towards its association with hypertrig…
23360988	Human CLPP reverts the longevity phenotype of a fungal ClpP deletion strain.	lifespan	2013-??-??	Mitochondrial maintenance crucially depends on the quality control of proteins by various chaperones, proteases and repair enzymes. While most of the involved components have been studied in some detail, little is known on the biological role of the CLPXP protease complex located in the mitochondrial matrix. Here we show that deletion of PaClpP, encoding the CLP protease proteolytic subunit CLPP, leads to an unexpected healthy phenotype and increased lifespan of the fungal ageing model organism Podospora anserina. This phenotype can be reverted by expression of human ClpP in the fungal deletion background, demonstrating functional conservation of human and fungal CLPP. Our results show that the biological role of eukaryotic CLP proteases can be studied in an experimentally accessible model organism.
29027807	Biochemistry of the menopause.	aging	2018-01-??	The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocri…
28088982	Accumulation of DNA damage in the aged hematopoietic stem cell compartment.	aging	2017-??-??	Aging is associated with loss of functional potential of multiple tissue systems, and there has been significant interest in understanding how tissue-specific cells contribute to this decline. DNA damage accumulation has been widely associated with aging in differentiated cell types. However, tissue-specific stem cells were once thought to be a geno-protected population, as damage accrued in a stem cell population has the potential to be inherited by differentiated progeny, as well as propagated within the stem cell compartment through self-renewal divisions. This review will discuss the evidence for DNA damage accumulation in the aged HSC compartment, potential drivers, and finally the consequences of the acquired damage.
23466301	Expression profiles of subtracted mRNAs during cellular senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow.	lifespan, aging	2013-05-??	Cellular senescence is an irreversible cell cycle arrest that limits the replicative lifespan of cells. Senescence suppresses development of tumors by regulating aging factors, such as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) and telomerase. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between young human mesenchymal stem cells (Y-hMSCs) and senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (S-hMSCs). We selected positive clones that were functionally characterized by referring to public databases using NCBI BLAST tool. This search revealed that 19 genes were downregulated, and 43 genes were upregulated in S-hMSCs relative to Y-hMSCs. Among subtracted clones in Y-hMSCs, most of genes markedly were related to metabolic functions. These genes, PDIA3, WDR1, FSTL1, COPG1, LMAN1, and PDIA6, significantly downregulated. Conversely, genes for subtracted clones in S-hMSCs were mostly associated with cell adhesion. In particular, the expression l…
29432893	Improvement of cognitive functions in response to a regular Nordic walking training in elderly women - A change dependent on the training experience.	aging	2018-??-??	Although regular physical activity is known to benefit health of aging populations, there are still many factors, which regulate exercise-induced adaptive changes. Among many vitamin D and myokines are under consideration. We, therefore, evaluated the influence of a single session of and regular Nordic Walking (NW) training combined with vitamin D supplementation on cognitive functions and muscle strength and some elements of the amino-acid profile. Thirty-five healthy elderly women (68 ± 5 years old) from health promotion programmes took part in the study. At baseline they were divided into two groups: women, who participated in NW training for the first time (Beginners Group: BG) and women, who continued regular NW training longer than four years (Advance Group: AG). All women had a similar concentration of vitamin D (above 20 ng·ml) at baseline. The 12 weeks of NW training was supported by supplementation of vitamin D (4000 IU/day). Muscle strength, serum concentrations of myokines …
19832964	Melanin and facial skin fluorescence as markers of yellowish discoloration with aging.	aging	2009-11-??	BACKGROUND: Although one clinical sign of aging and/or photoaging is a yellowish discoloration of the facial skin, little is known about the cause of this change. In addition to the increase in the epidermal melanin content, it has been suggested that advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to accumulate in photoaged skin, may affect this discoloration.    AIM: The objective of this pilot study was to non-invasively investigate the roles of melanin and AGEs in this yellowish discoloration of the facial skin.    METHODS: We examined the spectral reflectance at the cheek in 40 healthy Japanese women of various ages (mean age, 38.1 years) using a reflectance spectrophotometer and a spectrofluorimeter. The degree of yellowish tint was evaluated in terms of b(*). The amount of melanin in the skin was evaluated by calculating the melanin index (MI) A(640)-A(670) [A(lambda): log(10) (1/reflectance) at a wavelength of lambda]. The amount of AGEs was roughly evaluated using the …
14500696	Apolipoprotein D expression in human brain reactive astrocytes.	aging	2003-10-??	Astrocytosis is a hallmark of damage that frequently occurs during aging in human brain. Astrocytes proliferate in elderly subjects, becoming hypertrophic and highly immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These cells are one type that actively responds in the repair and reorganization of damage to the neural parenchyma and are a source of several peptides and growth factors. One of these biomolecules is apolipoprotein D (apo D), a member of the lipocalin family implicated in the transport of small hydrophobic molecules. Although the role of apo D is unknown, increments in brain apo D expression have been observed in association with aging and with some types of neuropathology. We have found an overexpression of apo D mRNA in reactive astrocytes by in situ hybridization in combination with immunohistochemistry for apo D in normal aged human brains. The number of double-labeled cells varied according to the cerebral area and the gliosis grade. The possible significanc…
1142849	Lysosomal enzymes and aging in vitro: subcellular enzyme distribution and effect of hydrocortisone on cell life-span.	aging	????-??-??	The acid phosphatase and beta glucuronidase activities of four subcellular fractions (nuclear, mitochondrial-lysosomal, microsomal, supernatant) of WI-38 cells were compared during in vitro aging. All of the fractions showed an age-associated increase in activity. The increase in the lysosomal fraction was sufficient to account for the increase in the whole homogenate. The supernatant fraction showed a consistent and pronounced increase suggesting a decrease in latency. Hydrocortisone stabilized the lysosomes to some extent. However the presence of hydrocortisone (5 mug/ml) in the growth medium consistently extended the life-span of the culture 20-30%. The magnitude of the extension seemed to be directly proportional to the amount of time the cultures were exposed to the added hormone.
12559407	Modulation of cell-phenotype during in vitro aging. Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis by skin fibroblasts and corneal keratocytes.	aging	2002-12-??	The aim of this study was to compare keratocyte and fibroblast phenotypes during in vitro aging by comparing their biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans using explant and cell cultures. Human skin and corneal explant cultures were realised with Dulbecco Modified Eagle's medium containing 3H glucosamine. Sequential cell cultures were studied at different passages for GAGs biosynthesis by 3H glucosamine incorporation followed by selective degradation with specific hydrolases. Radioactivity was determined and each GAG fraction evaluated. KS and DS are the major components synthesised by corneal explant culture. During in vitro aging, keratocytes synthesised 41% less KS between passages 4-9 with a decrease by 26% of the proportion of DS observed in the same conditions. In skin explant cultures, as expected the major components are CS and hyaluronan (HA). In the first cell passage studied compared with skin organ cultures we could notice a strong decrease of the proportions of DS and KS compen…
28152550	Novel 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 inhibitors reduce cortisol levels in keratinocytes and improve dermal collagen content in human ex vivo skin after exposure to cortisone and UV.	aging	2017-??-??	Activity and selectivity assessment of new bi-aryl amide 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitors, prepared in a modular manner via Suzuki cross-coupling, are described. Several compounds inhibiting 11β-HSD1 at nanomolar concentrations were identified. Compounds 2b, 3e, 7b and 12e were shown to selectively inhibit 11β-HSD1 over 11β-HSD2, 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2. These inhibitors also potently inhibited 11β-HSD1 activity in intact HEK-293 cells expressing the recombinant enzyme and in intact primary human keratinocytes expressing endogenous 11β-HSD1. Moreover, compounds 2b, 3e and 12e were tested for their activity in human skin biopsies. They were able to prevent, at least in part, both the cortisone- and the UV-mediated decreases in collagen content. Thus, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by these compounds can be further investigated to delay or prevent UV-mediated skin damage and skin aging.
18348080	High omega-3 fat intake improves insulin sensitivity and reduces CRP and IL6, but does not affect other endocrine axes in healthy older adults.	aging	2008-03-??	Aging diminishes hormone secretion and target cell responsiveness, possibly due to loss of cell membrane fluidity or alteration of membrane phospholipids affecting signal transduction. We investigated whether a high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet would improve endocrine function in 6 men and 6 women aged over 60 years. Subjects first ate an isocaloric control diet for 6 weeks, followed by an 8-week experimental diet, which included 720 g of fatty fish weekly plus 15 ml of sardine oil daily. In the last week, we measured RBC membrane fatty acids on each diet, performed pituitary, adrenal, hepatic, and Leydig cell endocrine provocative testing, and assayed selected cytokines. We also assessed insulin sensitivity utilizing octreotide insulin suppression testing and assessed free fatty acid (FFA) responses to isoproteronol. Insulin sensitivity increased significantly after 8 weeks on the omega-3 diet and FFA responses trended lower. Serum C-reactive protein was significantly reduc…
832427	Activities of purine pathway enzymes in gouty human fibroblasts aged in vitro.	aging	1977-02-01	The finite life-span of fibroblasts in culture may reflect aging at the cellular level and gout is clinical condition whose incidence also increases with age. In order to better understand the age-related changes in purine metabolism, activities of purine degrading (adenosine deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase) and reutilizing (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase and adenosine kinase) enzymes were measured in serially cultured skin fibroblasts from normal subjects and from gouty patients who overproduce uric acid. Serially cultured fibroblasts from gouty overproducers of uric acid displayed increased purine enzyme levels with increasing cell passage while fibroblasts from normal donors showed little change in activity. There was no alteration in relative degrading and reutilizing enzyme levels. The data suggest an increase in the rate of purine turnover in aging gouty fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts.
10739678	Gene-specific DNA repair of pyrimidine dimers does not decline during cellular aging in vitro.	aging	2000-04-10	A large number of studies have demonstrated that various kinds of DNA damage accumulate during aging and one of the causes for this could be a decrease in DNA repair capacity. However, the level of total genomic repair has not been strongly correlated with aging. DNA repair of certain kinds of damage is known to be closely connected to the transcription process; thus, we chose to investigate the level of gene-specific repair of UV-induced damage using in vitro aging of human diploid skin fibroblasts and trabecular osteoblasts as model systems for aging. We find that the total genomic repair is not significantly affected during cellular aging of cultures of both human skin fibroblasts and trabecular osteoblasts. Gene-specific repair was analyzed during cellular aging in the dihydrofolate reductase housekeeping gene, the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and the inactive region X(754). There was no clear difference in the capacity of young and old cells to repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in…
18207583	Expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) by human skin fibroblasts, effect of advanced glycation end-products and fucose or rhamnose-rich polysaccharides.	aging	????-??-??	Expression by cells of the SA-beta-Gal was shown to be a reliable indicator of the switch mechanism used by cells to enter the senescent phenotype. We used this method in order to explore the variation of SA-beta-Gal-positive cells with passage number and time spent in culture. Both parameters produced an increase of SA-beta-Gal-positive cells. The addition of a Maillard-product (advanced glycation end-product=AGE) to the fibroblast cultures also increased SA-beta-Gal expression. Fucose- and rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides (FROPs and RROPs, respectively) provided a significant protection against this AGE-induced increase of SA-beta-Gal-positive cells. It is speculated that these processes might well play an important role in skin aging.
9091184	Age-related response of human dermal fibroblasts to L-ascorbic acid: study of type I and III collagen synthesis.	aging	1996-12-??	Stimulation of the synthesis of type I and III collagens by 0.15 mM L-ascorbic acid (AA) was investigated in primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts form 30 females aged between 19 and 70 years. At this concentration allowing maximal stimulation, fibroblast cultures responded to this agent by an increase in collagen secretion, but to a lower extent for type III compared to type I, leading to an increase in the type I/III collagen ratio. We showed that AA stimulation of type I and III collagen secretion decreased in a statistically significant linear manner with donor age (slope = 1.9; p = 0.0014 and slope = -0.5; p = 0.0164, respectively). We also observed an age-related AA stimulation of the cell-associated collagen pool for type I collagen but not for type III (slope = 0.29; p = 0.015). This might indicate that a reduced ability of fibroblasts to secrete the newly synthesized type I collagen is involved in loss of the cellular response to AA stimulation. Analysis of AA stimulation as …
11193225	Human diploid fibroblasts that undergo a senescent-like differentiation have elevated ceramide and diacylglycerol.	aging	2001-01-??	Senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) have elevated levels of ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG) compared with young HDF. DNA fragmentation analysis demonstrated the increased ceramide in senescent HDF was not associated with apoptosis, whereas in young HDF, exogenous ceramide induced apoptosis. In young HDF treated with both exogenous ceramide and DAG, less DNA fragmentation was observed. Thus, elevated DAG levels in senescent HDF might protect against ceramide-induced apoptosis. To determine which characteristics of senescent HDF (aging per se, cell cycle arrest, elevated p21Sdi1,Waf1,Cip1, and senescent-like differentiation) might influence ceramide and DAG, we examined transformed or mitomycin C-treated HDF that shared some of these properties with senescent HDF. The elevation of ceramide and DAG did not depend on aging per se, cell cycle arrest, or elevation of p21. Rather, ceramide and DAG may be elevated as part of a program of differentiation that is induced by either aging …
2446977	Detection of IgG bound at the erythrocyte membrane by means of an immunohistochemical gold-silver technique.	aging	1987-??-??	The binding of IgG at the erythrocyte membrane during aging plays an important role in the elimination process of the cells by the reticulohistiocytic system. By means of an indirect protein A gold- and protein A gold-silver-method bound IgG was detected immunocytochemically on physiologically aged, pronase and neuraminidase treated red blood cells (RBC). At the light and electron microscopic level an increased binding of IgG at "old" as well as enzymatic treated cells in comparison to "young" and normal RBC was noted. The silver enhancement of gold particles visualized the immunostaining and permitted the semiquantitative analysis of the RBC by a scanning microdensitometer.
2742734	Psychological aspects of treating complete denture patients: their relation to prosthodontic success.	aging	????-??-??	Denture failures in the elderly are multifactorial. Such failures are rarely the result of technical or mechanical faults alone and are seldom corrected by remaking the denture. The dentist is in a position to reduce the number of prosthetic failures through the application of knowledge of the physical, metabolic, and endocrine changes associated with aging, as well as the emotional disturbances and nutritional deficiencies common among the aged.
1245298	Changes in RNA synthesis during the life span of human fibroblasts in vitro.	aging	1976-??-??	The prolongation of the life span of human fibroblasts in vitro by hydrocortisone seem to be associated with its stimulatory action on ribosome synthesis. The sustaining effect of the hormone on the latter remains, after withdrawal of hydrocortisone, for a time which is dependent on the age of the cells. When hydrocortisone is removed from cultures that have grown beyond the life span of the controls, the cells die within two passages. Hence, the events leading to the growth decline took place in spite of the presence of the hormone which does not seem to prevent the aging process but rather to delay it. The results could be compatible with either the error hypothesis or the theory which explains aging by an increased binding of histones to DNA with the subsequent blocking of genetic information.
31221064	Alteration of Hypoxia-Associated Gene Expression in Replicatively Senescent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells under Physiological Oxygen Level.	aging	2019-03-??	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a population of adult stem cells that modulate functional state of neighboring tissues. During cell aging, the biological activity of MSC changes, which may affect tissue homeostasis. It is known that reducing the oxygen level in vitro to physiological values typical to a particular cell niche leads to attenuation of some morphological and functional changes associated with aging. This work aimed to study gene expression in MSCs involved in response to physiological hypoxia using a replicative aging model under physiological (5%) and atmospheric (20%) oxygen in cultures. Our results show that significant reduction of proliferative activity of MSCs is observed after 20 passages (~50 cell generations). Regardless of the oxygen, in senescent cells PKM2, SERPINE1, and VEGFA were upregulated while ANKRD37, DDIT4, HIF1A, and TXNIP were downregulated. Also, ADORA2B, BNIPL, CCNG2, EGLN1, MAP3K1, MXI1, and P4HA1 were downregulated under hypoxia. The effect o…
16804029	Phage-displayed antibodies for the detection of glycated proteasome in aging cells.	aging	2006-05-??	Accumulation of posttranslationally damaged proteins during aging could explain the decline of cell performance with age. N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML) is the major glycation product on damaged proteins, causing dysfunction and cross-linking. The proteasome, a multicatalytic degradation complex, is one of the pathways for eliminating damaged proteins, and thus regulating their accumulation within the cell. However, the proteinase activities of the proteasome decline during aging. This may be due to posttranslational modifications of the subunits forming the proteasome complex. Using phage display technology, we have selected 16 single-chain variable fragments (scFv) recognizing the CML-modified alpha7 subunit of the proteasome. Using one of them, Ab3, we have observed a five-fold increase of CML-alpha7 in old human skin fibroblasts in comparison with young fibroblasts and telomerase-immortalized bone marrow cells (hTERT-BMCs).
30526376	Protection against UVB-induced damages in human dermal fibroblasts: efficacy of tricin isolated from enzyme-treated Zizania latifolia extract.	aging	2019-03-??	This study was undertaken to determine the effects of enzyme-treated Zizania latifolia (ETZL) and of its major compound tricin on skin photo-aging and to investigate the mechanisms involved. It was found ETZL and tricin suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production and increased type I-procollagen production in UVB-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Furthermore, ETZL and tricin significantly up-regulated the expressions of the antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and SOD1, reduced UVB-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induction by ROS and thereby attenuated activator protein-1 (AP-1) expression. In addition, ETZL and tricin both reduced the phosphorylations of IκBα and IKKα/ß and κB blocked the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. These results show that ETZL have skin protective effects against UVB and suggest tricin as major efficacious material in ETZL protecting skin photoaging.
12915210	Association of increased autophagic inclusions labeled for beta-galactosidase with fibroblastic aging.	aging	2003-08-??	Replicative senescence appears after a finite number of cell divisions. After proliferation has ceased, senescent cells remain viable for long periods and metabolic modifications are observed such as lipofuscin accumulation. In order to understand this phenomenon, we examined the emergence of subcellular modifications corresponding to autophagy in MRC5 normal human fibroblasts. An increase of monodansylcadaverine fluorescence, a specific marker of autophagy, in aging compared to young fibroblasts was observed (p<0.0001). The increase of autophagic vacuoles in aging fibroblasts was confirmed by electron microscopy. We compared young versus senescent fibroblasts and showed that autophagic vacuoles, already present in young cells, became larger in senescent fibroblasts with a significant relative increase of inclusion area with respect to measured cell area (p=0.0041). However, autophagy-associated-gene expression remained stable in senescent compared to young fibroblasts, suggesting that…
2731189	Fluorescence studies of the aged erythrocyte membranes.	aging	1989-??-??	The most important purpose of this research is to characterize by means of fluorescence polarization the structural and functional changes which occur in the membrane of the human erythrocytes during aging process. Our results provide evidence of a significant increase of membrane fluidity in the deep lipid core and in the lipid/protein boundary, in the aged erythrocytes. These features are associated with a rigidity of the membrane surface, as revealed by the anisotropy increase of a specific probe suitable for monitoring the membrane protein behaviour. These modifications could be considered as one of the mechanisms which contribute to alter erythrocyte rheological properties sufficiently to be recognised and removed within circulation.
29800817	Acidic domain of WRNp is critical for autophagy and up-regulates age associated proteins.	aging	2018-??-??	Impaired autophagy may be associated with normal and pathological aging. Here we explore a link between autophagy and domain function of Werner protein (WRNp). Werner (WRN) mutant cell lines AG11395, AG05229 and normal aged fibroblast AG13129 display a deficient response to tunicamycin mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced autophagy compared to clinically unaffected GM00637 and normal young fibroblast GM03440. Cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated autophagy in WS and normal aged cells is restored after transfection with wild type full length WRN, but deletion of the acidic domain from wild type WRN fails to restore autophagy. The acidic domain of WRNp was shown to regulate its transcriptional activity, and here, we show that it affects the transcription of certain proteins involved in autophagy and aging. Furthermore, siRNA mediated silencing of WRN in normal fibroblast WI-38 resulted in decrease of age related proteins Lamin A/C and Mre11.
9081760	Effect of in vitro aging on Campylobacter rectus lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PGE2 release from human gingival fibroblasts.	aging	1996-09-??	OBJECTIVE: We examined the influence of in vitro aging on Campylobacter rectus (C. rectus) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated prostaglandin (PG), E2 release frOm human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs).    MATERIALS AND METHODS: LPS was prepared from C. rectus ATCC33238. HGFs were established from healing gingival tissue removed from three patients (donors A, B and C), aged 10-12 years. Aging of the cells in culture was determined with increasing population doubling. The cells were cultured until confluence, then stimulated with LPS (1.0 micrograms ml-1), and the levels of PGE2 in the medium were measured after 24 h by radioimmunoassay.    RESULTS: The LPS-stimulated PGE2 production in each old cell (passage 17-20) was significantly increased to about 1.6-2.6 times than that in the corresponding young cells (passage 5-6). The gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in the old cells was higher than that in the young cells in response to LPS. In the absence of LPS, PGE2 production levels in …
25056231	Stereoselective skin anti-photoaging properties of ginsenoside Rg3 in UV-B-irradiated keratinocytes.	aging	2014-??-??	Ginsenosides are major bioactive constituents that are responsible for the diverse pharmacological activities of ginseng. This work aimed to assess the skin anti-photoaging activities of the two stereoisomeric forms of ginsenoside Rg3, 20(S)-Rg3 and 20(R)-Rg3. When the two Rg3 stereoisomers were added to cultured human keratinocyte HaCaT cells prior to irradiation with 70 mJ/cm(2) UV-B, 20(S)-Rg3, but not 20(R)-Rg3, decreased the UV-B-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a concentration-dependent manner, as detected by both fluorometric and confocal microscopic analyses. Likewise, 20(S)-Rg3, but not 20(R)-Rg3, decreased the UV-B-induced ROS levels in human dermal fibroblast cells. Both stereoisomers were unable to modulate the nitric oxide levels in HaCaT cells under UV-B irradiation, and induced no cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts. 20(S)-Rg3 suppressed the UV-B-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activities in HaCaT cells. Taken toge…
29242135	Quantitative image mean squared displacement (iMSD) analysis of the dynamics of profilin 1 at the membrane of live cells.	aging	2018-??-01	Image mean square displacement analysis (iMSD) is a method allowing the mapping of diffusion dynamics of molecules in living cells. However, it can also be used to obtain quantitative information on the diffusion processes of fluorescently labelled molecules and how their diffusion dynamics change when the cell environment is modified. In this paper, we describe the use of iMSD to obtain quantitative data of the diffusion dynamics of a small cytoskeletal protein, profilin 1 (pfn1), at the membrane of live cells and how its diffusion is perturbed when the cells are treated with Cytochalasin D and/or the interactions of pfn1 are modified when its actin and polyphosphoinositide binding sites are mutated (pfn1-R88A). Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy images, we obtained data on isotropic and confined diffusion coefficients, the proportion of cell areas where isotropic diffusion is the major diffusion mode compared to the confined diffusion mode, the size of the confin…
1297331	Transcription factor activity during cellular aging of human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	????-??-??	Human diploid fibroblasts display a limited proliferative life span in vitro, which is directly correlated to the age of the donor from which the cells were explanted. In an effort to identify molecular events that may underlie the loss of proliferative potential in aging fibroblasts, we have determined, at the protein level, the abundance of several cell-cycle-regulated proteins and the activity of the two major members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding complex. We find that cyclin A and p34cdc2 expression is decreased by two- to four-fold in old fibroblasts, but that Fos expression and binding activity are reduced by as much as 95% in old, as opposed to young cells, despite equivalent amounts of p105Rb and Jun proteins being expressed. We have further determined that the composition of the protein complex which binds a consensus (-TGACTCA-) AP-1 site changes dramatically during in vitro aging. Since we have shown previously that AP-1 activity is required for progression t…
19811411	Effects of aging on antioxidant response and phagocytosis in senescent erythrocytes.	aging	2009-??-??	Red blood cell (RBC) aging is a complex process affected by immunological and biochemical parameters. In this work we studied the antioxidant response in RBC of different ages. We also investigated their interaction with peripheral blood monocytes. Anticoagulated blood samples from 19 O RhD+ volunteers' donors were processed. Young (Y) RBC and Senescent (Se) RBC were obtained by self-formed gradients of Percoll. The fractionation of the erythrocytes suspensions was demonstrated by statistically significant density-related changes in hematological determinations. Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), of soluble NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (b5Rs) and membrane-bound b5R (b5Rm) were determined spectrophotometrically. The interaction between monocytes and different RBC suspensions was evaluated by the erythrophagocytosis assay. The G6PD and b5Rm activities in SeRBC were significantly lower than that observed in YRBC. No differences were found in the b5Rs of both groups. W…
29525179	Genetic markers of dopaminergic transmission predict performance for older males but not females.	aging	2018-??-??	Mobility and memory declines with aging can limit independence. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with cognitive performance, but studies investigating motor function are scant. We examined 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in dopaminergic metabolism: BDNF (Val66Met), DRD3 (Ser9Gly), DBH (C>T), and COMT (Val158Met) for their relationship to motor and cognitive function in healthy older adults (n = 4605 and n = 7331) who participated in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study. Individuals with genotypes associated with reduced dopamine metabolism exhibited poorer balance and memory. We found the most pronounced effects in the oldest participants (aged 85+ years), supporting the notion that age-related declines in dopamine availability contribute to magnified genotype effects with advancing age. Moreover, males demonstrated stronger associations than did females between a number of beneficial dopamine alleles and cognitive scores, suggesting that sex diff…
17161377	Downregulation of transcription factor, Sp1, during cellular senescence.	aging	2007-02-02	We found that the protein level of Sp1 transcription factor decreases as normal human fibroblasts undergo replicative aging. Sp1 also undergoes a rapid decrease in the protein level and activity in MCF-7 cells that are induced to a state of cellular senescence. In the cells treated with other DNA damaging chemicals such as actinomycin D and H(2)O(2), the Sp1 level decreased progressively as well. Inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases prevented this downregulation, suggesting that DNA damage signaling is involved in the regulation of the Sp1. This decrease in Sp1 protein level is due to the accelerated proteasomal degradation since a proteasome inhibitor, ALLN, blocked this downregulation. Therefore, the global decrease in gene transcription frequently reported in aging cells and tissues could be attributed at least in part to the decrease in Sp1 level.
16037231	Formation of alpha-aminoadipic and gamma-glutamic semialdehydes in proteins by the maillard reaction.	aging	2005-06-??	Recent research has demonstrated that nonenzymatic glycation (the Maillard reaction) lead to the formation of carbonyl groups and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in proteins. Such oxidative modifications are a major contributing factor to diabetic complications and aging. alpha-Aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS) and gamma-glutamic semialdehyde (GGS) have been identified as the major carbonyl products in oxidized proteins both in vitro and in vivo. AAS is an oxidative deamination product of lysine residue, while GGS originates from arginine and proline residues. To evaluate oxidative damage to proteins by the Maillard reaction, we developed a method of detecting AAS and GGS by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aldehydic residues in proteins were derivatized by reductive amination with NaCNBH3 and p-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), a fluorescence regent. After acid hydrolysis of the ABA-derivatized protein, ABA-AAS and ABA-GGS were measured by fluorometric HPLC. Thus, AAS and…
873988	Release of spectrin-free vesicles from human erythrocytes during ATP depletion. I. Characterization of spectrin-free vesicles.	aging	1977-06-??	Human erythrocytes incubated without glucose at 37 degrees C (in vitro aging) release spectrin-free vesicles after 12 or more hours. The release of vesicles is dependent upon ATP depletion. If the endogenous level of ATP is maintained, vesicle release is completely inhibited up to 54 h. Vesicle release is independent of hemolysis because in vitro aged cells and cells that maintain their ATP levels lose identical amounts of hemoglobin up to 45 h. 93 percent of all membrane particles released constitute a uniform population of spheres with a diameter of 185 +/- 23nm. These vesicles are of slightly varying densities due to varying contents of hemoglobin. Vesicles contain half the amount of membrane protein that is found in intact membranes when referred to the content of phospholipids phosphorus. This is primarily due to the absence of spectrin. However, their content of protein component III, glycophorin, and cholesterol remains the same as in intact membranes. Thus, the major integral m…
17061064	Effect of membrane-bound IgG and desialysation in the interaction of monocytes with senescent erythrocytes.	lifespan	2006-10-??	Determination of the erythrocyte lifespan is a complex process affected by many cellular parameters. In the present study we measured and characterised the red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins, mainly band 3, and quantified membrane-bound IgG in senescent RBC (SeRBC) and young RBC (YRBC). We also investigated, through a functional assay, the interaction between SeRBC and peripheral blood monocytes. We applied this erythrophagocytosis assay to study the phagocytosis of desialysed RBC. The results obtained showed no changes in the protein content between SeRBC and YRBC and no differences when examining membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE. Then, considering that the accumulation of autologous IgG on RBC membrane provides a direct mechanism for the removal of SeRBC, we measured the IgG content of intact RBC using an enzyme-linked anti-immunoglobulin test finding that the number of IgG molecules bound to SeRBC was significantly higher than that observed for YRBC. The increase observed in the pe…
23433549	UV-mediated downregulation of the endocytic collagen receptor, Endo180, contributes to accumulation of extracellular collagen fragments in photoaged skin.	aging	2013-04-??	BACKGROUND: Collagen is the most abundant protein in human skin and is responsible for its resilience. In particular during photoaging, collagen homeostasis is out of balance leading to a continuous loss of intact collagen and to the observed signs of aged skin such as diminished tensile strength and wrinkle development. The process of collagen turnover is very slow and the relevance of cellular uptake of damaged collagen, most likely mediated via Endo180 or integrin α2β1, still remains a matter of investigation.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of different collagen receptors on dermal fibroblasts for collagen internalization and their impact on collagen homeostasis during photoaging.    METHODS: TaqMan Real-Time PCR, flow cytometry, UV irradiation, knockdown experiments and immunostaining.    RESULTS: We show that Endo180 and integrin α2 are regulated in photoaged skin and after acute UV stress in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown experiments revealed that Endo180 is essential for c…
22808515	Peptides tissue-specifically stimulate cell differentiation during their aging.	aging	2012-05-??	We verified expression of CXCL12 and Hoxa3 transcription factors of differentiation in cultures of human embryonic pancreatic and bronchial cells and CXCL12 and WEGC1 factors in a culture of human prostatic fibroblasts. Reduced expression of these differentiation markers was detected in late-passage (aging) cultures. The expression of differentiation factors CXCL12, Hoxa3, and WEGC1 was tissue-specifically stimulated by short peptides: pancragen (Lys-Glu-Asp-Trp) in pancreatic cells, bronchogen (Ala-Glu-Asp-Leu) in bronchial epithelial cells, and vesugen (Lys-Glu-Asp) in fibroblasts. The inducing effect of peptides on the expression of differentiation factors was more pronounced in aged cultures, which can serve as a mechanism of their geroprotective effect.
18206666	Effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate on mitochondrial integrity and antioxidative enzyme activity in the aging process of human fibroblast.	aging	2008-03-15	Mitochondrial integrity and antioxidative enzyme activity are two of the determinants of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation probably underlying the aging mechanism. In this study, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was examined for its antiaging effect on human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). EGCG was evaluated for its cytotoxicity, and LC50 values were 78.0 and 84.4 microM for young and old HDF, respectively. HDF treated with EGCG at 25 and 50 microM for 24 h considerably increased catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD)1, SOD2, and glutathione peroxidase gene expressions and their enzyme activities, thus protecting HDF against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, accompanied with decreased intracellular ROS accumulation and well-maintained mitochondrial potential. Moreover, HDF treated with EGCG at 12.5 microM for long term showed less intracellular ROS with higher mitochondrial potential, more intact mitochondrial DNA, much elevated antioxidative enzyme efficiency, and more j…
10764987	Ultraviolet A radiation-induced biological effects in human skin: relevance for photoaging and photodermatosis.	aging	2000-03-??	There is increasing evidence that longwave ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVA; 320-400 nm) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of photodermatoses such as polymorphous light eruption as well as photoaging. In order to fully understand these detrimental effects it is critical to analyze the photobiological and molecular mechanisms by which UVA radiation affects the function of human skin cells. In this review, our current knowledge about the signal transduction pathway involved in UVA radiation-induced expression of proinflammatory genes relevant to the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption will be summarized. In addition, recent studies on the role of mitochondrial DNA mutations in UVA radiation-induced photoaging of human skin will be discussed. For both biological endpoints the UVA radiation-induced generation of singlet oxygen within human skin appears to be of critical importance. These studies are of enormous clinical relevance because they indicate that prevention of th…
23031395	Pain is associated with short leukocyte telomere length in women with fibromyalgia.	aging	2012-10-??	UNLABELLED: Telomere length, considered a measure of biological aging, is linked to morbidity and mortality. Psychosocial factors associated with shortened telomeres are also common in chronic pain; yet, little is known about telomere length in pain populations. Leukocyte telomere length was evaluated in 66 women with fibromyalgia and 22 healthy female controls. Participants completed questionnaires and a subgroup of fibromyalgia patients underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST; n = 12) and neuroimaging (n = 12). Telomere length was measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Although patients had shorter telomere length than controls, the difference was not statistically significant. However, higher levels of pain within fibromyalgia were associated with shorter telomere length (P = .039). When pain and depression were combined, patients categorized as high-pain/high-depression had an age-adjusted telomere length 265 base pairs shorter than those with low-pai…
7124656	Quantitative morphological analysis of proliferating and nonproliferating subpopulations of IMR-90 fibroblasts during aging in vitro.	aging	1982-07-??	Early-, mid- and late-passage cultures (population doubling levels 12, 35, and 51, respectively) of IMR-90 fibroblasts were exposed to 3H-thymidine for 48 h prior to fixation in situ for morphometric analysis in order to determine quantitatively what ultrastructural changes accompany the loss of proliferative capacity during aging in vitro. Analysis of autoradiographs, both at the light and electron microscopic levels, with an image analyzer followed by ANOVA statistical scrutiny demonstrated that a significant increase in relative cell area, an indicator of cell size, was characteristic of cells unable to incorporate 3H-TdR at both mid- and late-passage, but not at early-passage levels. Nuclear size also increased significantly with progressive passage level but was not related to proliferative capacity. No significant difference in the area fraction of nucleoli per unit area of nucleus or of mitochondria, Golgi, or lysosomes was seen in either subpopulation at any passage level. Dila…
28286269	Circular RNA profiling reveals that circCOL3A1-859267 regulate type I collagen expression in photoaged human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2017-??-29	Production of type I collagen declines is a main characteristic during photoaging, but the mechanism is still not fully understood. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of newly identified non-coding RNAs with regulatory potency by sequestering miRNAs like a sponge. It's more stable than linear RNAs, and would be a useful tool for regulation of gene expression. However, the role of circRNAs in collagen expression during photoaging is still unclear. Here we performed deep sequencing of RNA generated from UVA irradiated and no irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and identified 29 significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.05), 12 circRNAs were up-regulated and 17 circRNAs were down-regulated.3 most differentially expressed circRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR and the down-regulated circCOL3A1-859267 exhibited the most significantly altered in photoaged HDFs. Overexpression of circCOL3A1-859267 inhibited UVA-induced decrease of type I collagen expression…
17014852	Klotho RNAi induces premature senescence of human cells via a p53/p21 dependent pathway.	aging	2006-10-16	Klotho has recently emerged as a regulator of aging. To investigate the role of Klotho in the regulation of cellular senescence, we generated stable MRC-5 human primary fibroblast cells knockdown for Klotho expression by RNAi. Downregulation of Klotho dramatically induces premature senescence with a concomitant upregulation of p21. The upregulation of p21 is associated with cell cycle arrest at G1/S boundary. Knockdown of p53 in the Klotho attenuated MRC-5 cells restores normal growth and replicative potential. These results demonstrate that Klotho normally regulates cellular senescence by repressing the p53/p21 pathway. Our findings implicate Klotho as a regulator of aging in primary human fibroblasts.
26899446	The comparison of microRNA profile of the dermis between the young and elderly.	aging	2016-05-??	BACKGROUND: Skin aging is a process of structural and compositional remodeling that can be manifested as wrinkling and sagging. Remarkably, the dermis plays a dominant role in the process of skin aging. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in the regulation of gene expression in organism aging. However, studies about age-related miRNAs in human skin remain limited.    OBJECTIVE: To obtain an overall view of miRNAs expression in human aged dermis by comparison of dermis samples between young and elderly, construct the miRNA-gene-network and reveal the pivotal miRNAs in the regulatory network.    METHODS: Human dermis tissue was obtained from 12 donors, including 6 of young group and 6 of elderly one. The miRNA microarray and data analysis were performed. Target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted, followed by a gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis. A miRNA-gene-network was then constructed, and the pivotal miRNAs in the network was …
22143823	Human Xp/Yp telomere analysis by Southern-STELA.	aging	2012-04-??	Telomeres are specialized structures designed to protect the ends of linear chromosomes. They are dynamic structures such that in normal somatic cells they constantly shorten as cell division progresses. There is compelling evidence that telomere shortening leads to cell senescence, a process perceived as the main cause of aging in higher mammals. Therefore, the features of telomere shortening are of great importance in understanding cell senescence and aging in general. By identifying unique subtelomeric regions, large enough to produce strong chemiluminescent signals, we have provided a new tool for Southern blot analysis of individual human Xp/Yp telomeres. We extend these results with quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probe (PNA Q-FISH) analysis of telomeres on the Y chromosome. Our results demonstrates unequal shortening dynamics between the p and q telomeres.
10502396	Attenuated expression of 70-kDa heat shock protein in WI-38 human fibroblasts during aging in vitro.	aging	1999-10-10	We examined the effects of cellular aging on the expression of the heat shock-inducible HSP70 gene in WI-38 diploid human fibroblasts serially passaged in vitro. The senescence of the cells was established by evaluating population doubling level, cell density at confluency, and cell morphology along with the detection of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity (histochemically detectable at pH 6), a reliable marker of aging in low-density cultures. A marked decrease in the synthesis and accumulation of the inducible HSP70 protein was observed in serum-fed late passage cells exposed to a severe heat shock (30 min at 45 degrees C) in comparison to early passage cells. However, the degree of HSF-DNA binding, monitored by gel retardation assay was similar in both early and late passage cells. Similarly, Northern blotting analysis indicated that comparable amounts of inducible HSP70 mRNA were present in the total RNA fraction, in the total polyadenylated RNA fraction, or in the nu…
3089279	Vitamin E in young and old human red blood cells .	aging	1986-08-07	Young and old human red blood cells contain about the same amount of alpha-tocopherol, a compound which has previously been shown to be the major lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant present in such cells. Since red blood cells lose up to ca. 20% of lipid material from their membrane as they age, the alpha-tocopherol/membrane-lipid ratio actually rises with age rather than declining as might have been expected on the basis of the free radical theory of aging. The alpha-tocopherol/arachidonic acid moiety ratios increase in the order: young red blood cells less than old red blood cells less than plasma, which argues against the suggested membrane stabilizing effect of alpha-tocopherol/arachidonic acid moiety complexes.
7657482	Polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism of human skin fibroblasts during cellular aging.	aging	1995-??-??	The linoleic acid metabolism was studied in serially cultured human skin fibroblasts during 30 passages. Confluent cells were incubated with [U-14C]linoleic acid in serum free medium for 4 h after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 passages. The labeled linoleic acid was rapidly incorporated in cell lipids, preferentially into phospholipids (80%), and the distribution within the lipid classes remained constant during the cell cycles. The rate of conversion of [14C]linoleic acid into long chain fatty acids varied with the number of passages. The formation of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and of arachidonic acid decreased significantly from 12% to 5% (as % of incorporated linoleic acid) between 3 and 30 serial passages whereas the linoleic acid content increased in the cells from 68% to 83%. The results indicate that the desaturase activities decreased significantly during cellular aging of human skin fibroblasts.
1800129	A new human male diploid cell strain, TIG-7: its age-related changes and comparison with a matched female TIG-1 cell strain.	aging	1991-??-??	A new human diploid cell strain, TIG-7, which has the male karyotype, was established and characterized. Isozyme and histocompatibility typing of the cell strain was performed. The average in vitro life span of the cells is 73 population doublings. Changes in cell volume, doubling time, saturation density, the efficiency of cell attachment, plating efficiency, and relative DNA content were examined during in vitro cellular aging. Hydrocortisone slightly prolongs the life span of the cell strain when the hormone is administered to the cultures during middle passages. The age-related changes in the parameters of TIG-7 are not appreciably different from those of the previously established TIG-1 cell strain. These results show that this cell strain is useful for research on cellular aging; further profit is anticipated from research using a combination of these two sexually different cell strains.
20719841	The polycystic ovary post-rotterdam: a common, age-dependent finding in ovulatory women without metabolic significance.	aging	2010-11-??	INTRODUCTION: The age-specific prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), as defined by the Rotterdam criteria, among normal ovulatory women, has not yet been reported. It is also uncertain whether these women differ from their peers in the hormonal or metabolic profile.    METHODS: A total of 262 ovulatory Caucasian women aged 25-45 yr, enrolled in a community-based ovarian aging study (OVA), underwent transvaginal ultrasound assessment of ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) in the early follicular phase and were categorized as to whether they met the Rotterdam definition of PCO by AFC (≥12 in one ovary) and/or by volume (>10 cm(3) for one ovary). The effect of age on prevalence of PCO was assessed. Serum hormones and metabolic measures were compared between women meeting each element of the Rotterdam criterion and those without PCO using age-adjusted linear regressions.    RESULTS: The prevalence of PCO by AFC was 32% and decreased with age. Those with PCO by AFC had lower FS…
11421072	Induction of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinase 1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 in human skin in vivo by solar simulated radiation.	aging	2001-06-??	Repeated exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation results in premature skin aging due, in part, to the degradation of dermal collagen by fibroblast collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase 1 [MMP-1]). We have established TaqMan reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems to quantify the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MMP-1 and its specific inhibitor TIMP-1 in human buttock skin exposed in vivo to solar simulated radiation (SSR). A time-course study (n = 6) with two minimal erythema doses (MED) of SSR showed maximal induction of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 at 24 h. A dose-response study (n = 6) sampled at 24 h revealed that doses of about 1 MED were necessary to induce expression of MMP-1 mRNA, and our data suggest that the response is saturated at about 2 MED. We also investigated SSR-induced gene expression in the dermis and epidermis separately (n = 5). MMP-1 was present in both tissues, but TIMP-1 was only detected in the dermis. In general, we could only measure MMP-1 m…
18382083	Nutritional situation of the elderly in Eastern/Baltic and Central/Western Europe - the AgeingNutrition project.	aging	2008-??-??	BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the AgeingNutrition project, funded by the European Commission, partners from 10 'Eastern/Baltic' (new) European (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Turkey) and 5 'Central/Western' (old) European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, and Spain) performed a comparative analysis of existing data on nutritional status, food intake, nutrient intake, dietary habits and lifestyle of the aging population in Europe.    METHODS: Using predefined inclusion criteria, 36 studies (22 from Eastern/Baltic, 14 from Central/Western countries) were chosen for evaluation. The studies varied in general design, data assessment and parameters and methods applied (especially regarding assessment of nutritional situation, comprising anthropometry, blood lipid profile, dietary nutrient and food intake). Thus, data evaluation by recalculation of raw data had to be restricted to a few distinct, common parameters.    RESU…
12151283	Cell adhesion molecule expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in major depression in the elderly.	aging	2002-08-??	BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in major depression.    AIMS: We investigated the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in the prefrontal cortex in depression.    METHOD: Immunohistochemistry to localise CAMs in post-mortem tissue from 20 subjects with major depression and 20 controls, and image analysis to quantify their expression.    RESULTS: We found significant increases in CAMs in the grey matter of the DLPFC in the depression group but no comparable differences in the ACC or occipital cortex. In the white matter there was a non-significant increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-I in the DLPFC in the depression group but no increase in the other areas or for vascular cell adhesion molecule-I in any area. Paired tests showed specificity for the DLPFC in the depression group only.    CONCLUSIONS: The increase in CAM expression in the DLPFC suggests an inflammator…
8803927	Alterations in transcription factor-binding activities to fibronectin promoter during aging of vascular endothelial cells.	aging	1996-07-05	Previously, we showed that the expression of the fibronectin (FN) gene is enhanced during aging of human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. To elucidate the mechanism, we explored binding proteins to the FN promoter. The promoter contains sites for the general transcription factors: CAAT-binding transcription factor (CTF), promoter-specific transcription factor-1 (Sp1), and transcription factor-IID (TFIID). The promoter also contains sites for inducible transcription factors, cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), and Activator protein 2 (AP-2). We synthesized 10 different oligonucleotides for these and other potential transcription factor-binding sites. Using these oligonucleotides, we searched for binding proteins in young and old endothelial cells by electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays. Our results showed that AP-1 decreased with aging, but Sp1 and CREB1 were unaffected. However, decreased binding activities to CRE at positions -170 and -415 were show…
16673649	Activity of two enzymes associated with apoptosis and cell aging in arterial hypertension.	aging	2006-02-??	OBJECTIVE: To study the activity of two enzymes, transmembrane reductase (TMR) and cytosolic low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (ACP1), in arterial hypertension (HT) in a sample of adults aged over 50 years.    METHODS: A sample of 153 adults, 77 with hypertension and 76 normotensive (NT), aged between 50 and 90 years (mean: 71.87 +/- 11.59), of both sexes, was studied. TMR (mmol/cell/h) and ACP1 (micromol/gHb/h) activity in red blood cells was determined by spectrophotometry. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student's t test and Pearson's correlation.    RESULTS: We observed a significant difference in TMR activity between normotensive and hypertensive subjects, with lower levels in the hypertensives (NT = 4.762 +/- 2.595; HT = 3.878 +/- 1.748), p = 0.01. ACP1 activity, although higher in hypertensive patients, did not differ significantly from normotensive subjects (p = 0.08) (NT = 242.827 +/- 97.618; HT = 309.561 +/- 150.738). No correlation was observed…
28032397	DNA base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair synergistically contribute to survival of stationary-phase cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	lifespan, aging	2017-03-??	Defects of genome maintenance may causally contribute to aging. In general, base excision repair (BER) is involved in the repair of subtle base lesions and AP sites, and bulky helix-distorting lesions are restored by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Here, we measured the chronological lifespan (CLS) of BER- and NER-deficient mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and observed the aging process of cells. The CLS of the nth1 (gene for DNA glycosylase/AP lyase) mutant and the rad16 (a homolog of human XPF) mutant were slightly shorter than that of the wild-type (WT) strain. However, survival of the nth1Δ rad16Δ double mutant was significantly reduced after entry into the stationary phase. Deletion of rad16 in an AP endonuclease mutant apn2Δ also accelerated chronological aging. These results indicate that BER and NER synergistically contribute to genome maintenance in non-dividing cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in cells during the stationary phase, and …
15036401	mRNA level of alpha-2-macroglobulin as an aging biomarker of human fibroblasts in culture.	aging	2004-03-??	Cellular senescence is a well-established model system for studying the molecular basis of aging. To identify a reliable biomarker for cellular age and further study the gene expression of aging, we profiled the gene expression difference between aged and young cultured human embryonic lung fibroblasts by high-density complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) arrays. Among the differentially expressed genes, alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) was selected for further study. Its gene expression level as a function of population doubling level (PDL) in cultured fibroblasts was determined by RT-PCR and northern hybridization. mRNA level of alpha(2)M showed a positive linear-correlation with cumulative PDL. Additional assays revealed that the levels of alpha(2)M increased in irreversible growth arrest induced by sublethal H(2)O(2), but not in quiescent state of cultured fibroblasts induced by serum-deprivation, and remained stable in Hela cells. These results suggest that mRNA level of alp…
21266744	p53 governs telomere regulation feedback too, via TRF2.	aging	2011-01-??	p53 takes critical part in a number of positive and negative feedback loops to regulate carcinogenesis, aging and other biological processes. Uncapped or dysfunctional telomeres are an endogenous DNA damage that activates ATM kinase (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and then p53 to induce cellular senescence or apoptosis. Our recent study shows that p53, a downstream effector of the telomere damage signaling, also functions upstream of the telomere‐capping protein complex by inhibiting one of its components, TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2). Since TRF2 inhibition leads to ATM activation, a novel positive feedback loop exists to amplify uncapped telomere‐induced, p53‐mediated cellular responses. Siah1 (seven in absentia homolog 1), a p53‐inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a key role in this feedback regulation by targeting TRF2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Biological significance and therapeutic implications of this study are discussed.
19693768	Cellular senescence and longevity of osteophyte-derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to patient-matched bone marrow stromal cells.	longevity, aging	2009-11-01	This study aimed to determine the cellular aging of osteophyte-derived mesenchymal cells (oMSCs) in comparison to patient-matched bone marrow stromal cells (bMSCs). Extensive expansion of the cell cultures was performed and early and late passage cells (passages 4 and 9, respectively) were used to study signs of cellular aging, telomere length, telomerase activity, and cell-cycle-related gene expression. Our results showed that cellular aging was more prominent in bMSCs than in oMSCs, and that oMSCs had longer telomere length in late passages compared with bMSCs, although there was no significant difference in telomere lengths in the early passages in either cell type. Telomerase activity was detectable only in early passage oMSCs and not in bMSCs. In osteophyte tissues telomerase-positive cells were found to be located perivascularly and were Stro-1 positive. Fifteen cell-cycle regulator genes were investigated and only three genes (APC, CCND2, and BMP2) were differentially expressed …
6549561	Ultrastructural localization of ConA and WGA receptors on human corneal endothelium.	aging	????-??-??	Corneal endothelial cell plasma membrane plays an important role in maintaining normal thickness and transparency of the cornea. We investigated the molecular organization of endothelial cell membrane using lectins labeled with colloidal gold as ultrastructural probes. We detected the presence of Concanavalin A and Wheat Germ Agglutinin which recognize specific carbohydrate residues of membrane glycoconjugates. We think that this fine cytochemical approach may be useful to better understand the transport mechanisms between aqueous humor and corneal endothelium and to study adaptation and aging of corneal endothelial cells.
7251685	Glycosaminoglycan synthesis and composition in human fibroblasts during in vitro cellular aging (IMR-90).	aging	1981-05-??	The synthesis and turnover of sulfate-labeled glycosaminoglycans(35S-GAGs) has been investigated in diploid human embryo fibroblasts during in vitro cellular aging. With progressive subcultivation, there was a decreased incorporation of Na2(35)SO4 into 35S-GAGs released to the medium, but not into those accumulated at the cell surface. The composition of 35S-GAGs found in extracellular medium, cell surface (removable by gentle proteolysis), and intracellular compartments of the culture after 48-hr labeling did not change significantly with progressive subcultivation. Pulse-labeled 35S-GAGs moved from intracellular to surface and extracellular compartments more slowly in late-passage cultures. Addition of 1 mM beta-xyloside to both early- and late-passage cultures produced a ten-fold enhancement of extracellular 35S-GAG production without a concomitant increase in surface-associated 35S-GAG. We interpret the data of this study to mean that secreted and cell-surface glycosaminoglycans re…
15915509	Novel fluorescence assay using calcein-AM for the determination of human erythrocyte viability and aging.	aging	2005-07-??	BACKGROUND: A highly sensitive, fast, and simple flow cytometric assay to assess human red blood cell (RBCs) viability and aging is reported.    METHODS: The assay described in this report is based on the use of acetoxymethyl ester of calcein (calcein-AM), a fluorescein derivative and nonfluorescent vital dye that passively crosses the cell membrane of viable cells and is converted by cytosolic esterases into green fluorescent calcein, which is retained by cells with intact membranes and inactive multidrug resistance protein. The loss of calcein can be easily determined by flow cytometry, and the cytosolic localization of esterases was demonstrated by spectrofluorometric analyses.    RESULTS: We found that RBCs incubated with Ca(2+), which induces a rapid and modulated self-death that shares several features with apoptosis (Bratosin et al., Cell Death Differ 2001;8:1143-1156), externalized phosphatidylserine and lost calcein staining and cytosolic adenosine triphosphate content.

511950	A new cell surface marker of aging in human diploid fibroblasts.	aging	1979-08-??	The relationship of cell surface changes to proliferative decline of human diploid fibroblasts was investigated using the concanavalin A-mediated red blood cell adsorption assay. The amount of the red blood cells adsorbed to human diploid fibroblasts via concanavalin A increased continuously from the early phases of cell passage up through cell senescence, while the amount of 3H-concanavalin A binding did not change to a significant extent. The red blood cell adsorption is not a function of cell cycle phase and time spent in culture. Cocultivation of young cells with old cells also did not affect the adsorption capacity of respective cells. Thus, the concanavalin A-mediated red blood cell adsorption can be expected to serve as a new cell surface marker for aging in vitro. Using this marker, it was revealed that transient cell size or 3H-thymidine incorporating capacity di not have a direct relationship with the division age of a cell. Small rapidly dividing cells in old populations res…
1488981	Acrometageria: a spectrum of "premature aging" syndromes.	aging	1992-10-01	A child with manifestations of acrogeria and metageria, two "premature aging" syndromes, is presented. Because of his indistinct phenotype and because the question has been previously raised as to whether these conditions are separate, we propose the designation of acrometageria to describe this phenotypic continuum. As there is much in common clinically between acrometageria and the syndrome of type III procollagen deficiency (Ehlers-Danlos type IV), it might be presumed that a similar pathogenesis for acrometageria exists. This possibility has been tested previously, without demonstrating specific quantitative or qualitative deficits, but with some indirect evidence that collagen metabolism is deranged in these patients. One such crude indicator is the elevation of urinary hyaluronic acid levels, demonstrated in our patient and also observed in the phenotypically distinct Werner and Hutchinson-Gilford premature aging syndromes. On one hand, it could be argued that this supports the c…
29188870	Association between Siesta (Daytime Sleep), Dietary Patterns and the Presence of Metabolic Syndrome in Elderly Living in Mediterranean Area (Medis Study): The Moderating Effect of Gender.	aging	2017-??-??	OBJECTIVES: Several lifestyle parameters including diet, physical activity and sleep were associated in isolation with the presence of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in adults, to date there is a paucity of studies which evaluated their combined role aging populations and especially with respect to gender. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide a global consideration of the lifestyle factors associated with MetS among elderly individuals.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study.    SETTING: 21 Mediterranean islands and the rural Mani region (Peloponnesus) of Greece.    PARTICIPANTS: during 2005-2015, 2749 older (aged 65-100 years) from were voluntarily enrolled in the study.    MEASUREMENTS: Dietary habits, energy intake, physical activity status, socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle parameters (sleeping and smoking habits) and clinical profile aspects were derived through standard procedures. The presence of MetS was defined using the definition provided by N…
10989122	Repair of telomeric DNA prior to replicative senescence.	aging	2000-09-01	The average length of telomere repeats at the ends of chromosomes in most normal human somatic cells has been found to decrease by 50-200 base pairs with each cell division. The loss of telomere repeats has been causally linked to replicative senescence by the demonstration that overexpression of the enzyme telomerase can result in the elongation or maintenance of telomeres and immortalization of somatic cells with a diploid and apparently normal karyotype. Major questions that remain are related to the actual mechanism by which telomere shortening induces replicative senescence and the importance of telomere shortening and replicative senescence in the homeostasis of cells in renewal tissues and aging. This perspective is concerned with the consequences of telomere shortening at individual chromosomes in individual cells. Experimental evidence indicates that short telomeres accumulate prior to senescence and that replicative senescence is not triggered by the first telomere to reach a…
25442593	Evolution of phenolic compounds and sensory in bottled red wines and their co-development.	aging	2015-04-01	This study aimed to assess the correspondence between the evolution of phenolic compounds and the development of appearance and mouthfeel in Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L. cv.) dry red wines during 18-month aging in bottle. The wines were sealed with six types of bottle stoppers. The results showed that phenolic compounds presented four evolution patterns along with wine aging in bottle, mainly depending on their chemical nature. Most of the anthocyanins had significant differences in concentration amongst the wines sealed with the six bottle stoppers at the 18-month point. Analysis of partial least squares (PLS) revealed that wine appearance quality was positively correlated with the levels of malvidin-3-O-(6-O-acetyl)-glucoside-4-vinylguaiacol, gallocatechin and dihydrokaempferol-3-O-rhamnos, while the development of mouthfeel properties was positively associated with the evolutions of malvidin-3-O-glucoside-ethyl-(epi)catechin, peonidin-3-O-(6-O-acetyl)-glucoside, malvidin-3-…
1405791	Aging as a multi-step process characterized by a lowering of entropy production leading the cell to a sequence of defined stages. II. Testing some predictions on aging human fibroblasts in culture.	aging	1992-08-??	The concepts of irreversible thermodynamics have been used in order to develop a theory of aging considered as a multi-step process leading the cell through a sequence of defined stages characterized by a lower level of entropy production and finally to a critical level of errors involving cell death (Toussaint et al., 1991). One of the predictions of this model is that external stresses which can be considered as fluctuations would accelerate the evolution of the cell from one state to the other according to the intensity of the stress. Seven morphotypes have been observed in the serially cultivated human fibroblasts, cells passing progressively from one morphotype to the other. In this paper, we experimentally tested the effect of two different molecules, tert-butylhydroperoxide and ethanol, in order to determine their influence on the shift from one morphotype to the other. When applied for a single period of time on cultivated cells, both molecules effectively showed a modification…
23148930	A novel niche for skin derived precursors in non-follicular skin.	aging	2013-02-??	BACKGROUND: Skin derived precursors (SKP) comprise a subset of specialized dermal cells that can be distinguished from fibroblast by their capacity for spheroidal growth. Recent investigations have shown that hair follicles constitute a niche for this cell type, but their localization and their definite function in non-follicular skin remains largely unknown.    OBJECTIVE: To identify the dermal niche of non-follicular SKPs and to analyze whether functional aspects correlate with this localization.    METHODS: SKPs were isolated from separate anatomical regions of human abdominal skin. Fluorescence activated cell sorting then was used to obtain a pure population of non-follicular SKPs. Functional characterization of these cells was performed applying differentiation and proliferation assays. Information on specific in vivo functions was derived from histological evaluation of quantity and localization patterns.    RESULTS: Sphere forming capacity and differentiation assays show that SK…
17585503	Asymmetric distribution of DNA between daughter cells with final symmetry breaking during aging of human fibroblasts.	aging	2007-??-??	Human fibroblasts proliferating in vitro go through functional modifications, lose progressively their capacity to divide, and enter finally a post-mitotic state. These events are supposed to reproduce the developmental steps taking place in vivo during aging of the organism. The gradual changes occurring through proliferation are incompatible with an even distribution of the genetic material during cell division. We measured the amount of DNA on pairs of daughter cells at different population doubling levels of human fibroblasts. It was found that at each doubling in a significant fraction of cells, the distribution of DNA between sister cells is asymmetric. The cell system is in a steady state through the different phases of the fibroblast population life span; then during the last mitoses when the cells enter the terminal phase IV there is symmetry breaking with a phase transition, the cells settling into a new state.
4447631	Membrane glycopeptides from old and young human erythrocytes.	aging	1974-06-??	Glycopeptides were extracted by papain digestion from old and young human erythrocyte membranes and fractionated on DEAE-Sephadex A-25. Chemical characterization of the unfractionated samples and of the main peak eluted from the column indicates that glycoproteins of the erythrocyte membrane undergo significant decreases in sialic acid and galactosamine content with aging.
23475372	Levels of metallic elements and their potential relationships to cognitive function among elderly from Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) settlement in Selangor Malaysia.	aging	2013-06-??	Exposure to toxic metals and excessive amount of trace elements is a risk factor of cognitive decline. Continuous monitoring of these elements by the use of metabolically inactive tissues such as fingernails may help in taking preventive measures to delay the cognitive decline process. In this study, the cognitive function of 54 elderlies (60-72 years old) from FELDA Sungai Tengi, Selangor, was evaluated using the Malay version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in fingernail were detected using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Results showed that (92.6 %) our population was cognitively impaired based on the MoCA with mean score of 18.07 ± 5.11. The mean level of elements in fingernails for As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were 16.68 ± 3.52, 4.26 ± 0.91, 4.81 ± 1.16, 1.00 ± 0.23, 1.83 ± 0.47, and 40.86 ± 10.81 μg/g, respectively. Signific…
2972328	Decreased Ca pump ATPase activity associated with increased density in human red blood cells.	aging	1988-??-??	Red blood cells (rbcs) from five different normal humans were separated according to density using a simple procedure. The procedure involved centrifugation for 30 minutes in small glass tubes in the absence of any density gradient medium. This produced a column of rbcs arranged according to their density. Samples of the top 8% of the columns and bottom 8% of the columns were removed from the tubes with a micropipet. From each donor, samples of the least and most dense cells, respectively, were pooled from multiple tubes for each donor and designated "top" and "bottom" cells. These top and bottom cells were compared with unselected (total) cells from the same subjects, respectively. Top cells were larger and bottom cells were smaller than total cells. ATPase activities were operationally defined and measured in saponin lysates of these rbcs. The Ca pump ATPase (both in the calmodulin-activated and calmodulin-independent states [achieved by addition of compound 48/80]) of the top cells …
12510171	Aging of myocardial collagen.	aging	2002-??-??	The objective of this article was to present a review of the collagen tissue of the heart muscle as a function of age. The myocardial collagen matrix consists of a network of fibrillar collagen which is intimately connected to the myocyte. Most collagen fibers reside in parallel with myocytes. These fibers may have a wavy, taut or coiled appearance. Fibrillar collagen types I and III are the major components of the myocardial collagen matrix. Collagen type I has been found to represent nearly 80% of the total collagen protein, while type III collagen is present in lower proportions (approximately 11%). Cardiac fibroblasts are the cellular source of fibrillar collagen, cardiac myocytes expressing only mRNA for type IV collagen. Collagens types I and III exhibit a high tensile strength which plays an important role in the behavior of the ventricle during the cardiac cycle. The collagen concentration and the intermolecular cross-linking of collagen increase with age. Measurements of colla…
16114899	Binding of amyloidogenic transthyretin to the plasma membrane alters membrane fluidity and induces neurotoxicity.	aging	2005-08-30	Transthyretin (TTR) can deposit as amyloid in the peripheral nervous system and induce a peripheral neuropathy. We examined the mechanism of TTR amyloid neurotoxicity on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Wild-type (WT) TTR and two amyloidogenic mutants (V30M and L55P) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Incubation (aging) of WT TTR at 37 degrees C for 1 week caused no significant aggregation. However, there was a significant increase in the extent of amyloid fibril formation after the amyloidogenic mutants had been aged. L55P TTR aggregated more readily than V30M TTR. Both amyloidogenic mutants were neurotoxic after aging. The order of neurotoxicity was as follows: L55P > V30M > WT. As binding of amyloid proteins to the plasma membrane may cause cytotoxicity, we studied the binding of TTR to a plasma membrane-enriched preparation from SH-SY5Y cells by surface plasmon resonance. All three forms bound to the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions. The binding of the amyloidogenic …
12540210	Proliferative ability and alkaline phosphatase activity with in vivo cellular aging in human pulp cells.	lifespan, aging	2003-01-??	Little is known about the effect of aging on characteristic functions of pulp cells. When damaged pulp is recovered and mineralized tissue is formed to protect remaining pulp tissue, the general responses of pulp tissue after adequate stimuli (pulp cell proliferation and activation of alkaline phosphatase [ALPase]) are thought to be essential. In this study, we compared proliferative ability and ALPase activity between cultures of human pulp (HP) cells obtained from young and aged donors. The in vitro proliferative lifespan of HP cells from young donors was longer than HP cells from aged donors. Growth rates and ALPase activity of HP cells decreased with increasing donor age. These findings suggest that impaired repair of pulp and dentin in aged patients is partly due to a decrease in the proliferative ability and ALPase activity in aged pulp cells.
6387322	Genome reorganization during cellular senescence.	aging	1984-10-15	It was previously suggested that aging of dividing cells depends on the reorganization of the cell genome during the division cycle and is determined by chance, intrinsic properties of the genome and environmental factors. A considerable amount of evidence has accumulated supporting the hypothesis. This is reviewed in terms of the reorganization taking place at the different orders of DNA structure.
7252070	Normal CuZn superoxide dismutase, Mn superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in Werner's syndrome.	aging	1981-07-??	Werner's syndrome is often regarded as a segmental progeroid syndrome. It has been suggested that free radical damage involving oxygen contributes to aging. Furthermore, lymphocytes from Werner's syndrome patients show in vitro increased chromosome breakage and are protected by exogenous superoxide dismutase and catalase. We prepared erythrocytes and lymphocytes from three patients with Werner's syndrome and determined four important enzymes protecting against oxygen toxicity; CuZn superoxide dismutase, Mn superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. All enzymic activities were found to be normal.
25013207	Age-related increase of VGF-expression in T lymphocytes.	aging	2014-06-??	VGF is a protein expressed by neurons and processed into several peptides. It plays a role in energy homeostasis and promotes growth and survival. Recently, VGF mRNA was detected in peripheral leukocytes. Since it is known that aging is associated with a decrease in the development and function of neuronal as well as immune cells, we addressed the question whether a peripheral expression of VGF by CD3+ T cells and CD56+ NK cells is correlated with age. Therefore, the frequency of VGF+CD3+ and VGF+CD56+ cells was determined in mentally healthy volunteers aged between 22 and 88. We found an age-dependent increase in the number of VGF+CD3+ T cells that correlated with HbA1c and the body mass index (BMI). VGF-expression by NK cells was age-independent. Blockade of VGF reduced proliferation and secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF by CD3+ T cells and PBMCs. Rapamycin-mediated T cell blockade significantly reduced the frequency of VGF-expressing T cells. We concl…
22457327	Focus issue: TOR signaling, a tale of two complexes.	aging	2012-03-27	Through its association with two distinct protein complexes, target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), the kinase TOR coordinates cellular growth with cell cycles, growth factors, and nutrients. The interconnected TOR signaling network participates in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as aging, stem cell renewal, cell specification, and carcinogenesis; therefore, understanding the details of this system may yield new ways to promote longer, healthier living. This issue provides an overview of research on TOR signaling that has emerged since the issue Science Signaling devoted to this topic in 2009.
18691516	Advancement in skin aging: the future cosmeceuticals.	aging	????-??-??	Aging is a multifactorial process defined as the accumulation of damage. The aging of the skin is characterized by specific clinical end points, the cause of which is not always thoroughly understood. The skin is exposed to environmental aggressions and the reactive oxygen species produced during cellular metabolism. Damage to the cellular and extracellular components of the skin can be avoided or removed by the appropriate topical application of active ingredients. Sunscreens are essential to avoid damage from the most important damaging environmental agent: solar radiation. Liposomes containing deoxyribonucleic acid repair enzymes and accelerate the endogenous removal of pyrimidine dimers after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Specific antioxidants reduce the rate of formation of secondary ultraviolet-induced damages, particularly those induced by singlet oxygen. Anti-inflammatory agents, immunostimulants, and enhancers of molecular and cellular detoxification could enter the panop…
9739504	Age-associated alterations in calcium current and its modulation in cardiac myocytes.	aging	1998-08-??	The calcium current is one of the most important components in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. During aging, the magnitude of L-type Ca++ channel current (ICa,L) is significantly increased in parallel with the enlargement of cardiac myocytes, resulting in unaltered ICa,L density. Since the inactivation of ICa,L is slowed and the action potential duration is prolonged, the net Ca++ influx during each action potential is likely to be increased in senescent hearts relative to young ones. This augmentation of Ca++ influx may be important for the preserved cardiac function of the older heart in the basal state. However, it increases the risk of Ca++ overload and Ca(++)-dependent arrhythmias in the senescent heart. During stress, the response of ICa,L to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation is markedly reduced, which may be an important cause of the age-related decrease in cardiac reserve function. These age-dependent changes in ICa,L and its modulations are similar to those observe…
856836	Characterization of the cell cycle of cultured human diploid cells: effects of aging and hydrocortisone.	lifespan, aging	1977-03-??	Age-related changes in the cytokinetics of human diploid cells in vitro have been compared in normal cultures and in cultures in which lifespan has been prolonged by the addition of hydrocortisone to the medium. For both cultures, with advancing age the fraction of cells in the actively proliferating pool decreased and the intercellular variation in cell cycle times increased. The average cell cycle time was prolonged during aging due almost entirely to changes in the duration of G1. The duration of S remained constant, while a small delay in G 2 was observed in late passage cells near the end of their lifespan. Although the same pattern of change in proliferative parameters occurred in both control and hydrocortisone-treated cultures, the changes were somewhat delayed in the presence of the steroid. The results are interpreted in terms of several cell cycle models and suggest that the events controlling cell proliferation are sensitive to hydrocortisone modulation during the G1 and po…
10416055	Coenzyme Q10, a cutaneous antioxidant and energizer.	aging	1999-??-??	The processes of aging and photoaging are associated with an increase in cellular oxidation. This may be in part due to a decline in the levels of the endogenous cellular antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone, CoQ10). Therefore, we have investigated whether topical application of CoQ10 has the beneficial effect of preventing photoaging. We were able to demonstrate that CoQ10 penetrated into the viable layers of the epidermis and reduce the level of oxidation measured by weak photon emission. Furthermore, a reduction in wrinkle depth following CoQ10 application was also shown. CoQ10 was determined to be effective against UVA mediated oxidative stress in human keratinocytes in terms of thiol depletion, activation of specific phosphotyrosine kinases and prevention of oxidative DNA damage. CoQ10 was also able to significantly suppress the expression of collagenase in human dermal fibroblasts following UVA irradiation. These results indicate that CoQ10 has the efficacy to prevent many of the…
6882865	Interaction of human serum apolipoprotein B with sodium deoxycholate.	aging	1983-07-??	Preparation of apolipoprotein B (Apo B)-deoxycholate (DOC) complexes by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 20 mM DOC, pH 8.5, gave two populations of particles with 5% (peak I) and 13% (peak II) lipid remaining bound. These complexes were initially shown to be very large and elongated, with partition radii of approx. 131 +/- 0.5 A, weight average molecular weights of approx. 164 000 +/- 1 000, and an intrinsic viscosity of 80.19 +/- 2.21 ml/g. Additionally, they appeared very similar to native low-density lipoprotein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, giving one major band. Incubation of these samples for 10 days under nitrogen at 4 degrees C in the presence of antibiotics and protease inhibitor resulted in dissociation to many smaller subunits. Results of scanning molecular sieve chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that dissociation of these complexes was relatively slow and indicated the presence of at least two classes of components in …
12437453	Induction of manganese superoxide dismutase in human dermal fibroblasts: a UV-B-mediated paracrine mechanism with the release of epidermal interleukin 1 alpha, interleukin 1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha.	aging	2002-11-??	BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species generated in the skin by UV irradiation promote photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. The manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a primary antioxidant enzyme that crucially contributes to the homeostasis of oxygen radicals within the mitochondria, and thus critically participates in the control of senescence and tumor generation.    OBJECTIVE: To determine whether repetitive UV-B exposure, as practiced for light hardening during phototherapy for various photodermatoses, can enhance the adaptive antioxidant response by up-regulating MnSOD activity in either the epidermal or the dermal skin compartment.    DESIGN: In vitro experiments to determine MnSOD activity levels in cultured human dermal fibroblasts and epidermal cells (HaCaT cells and primary keratinocytes) at different times after direct UV-B exposure or after incubation of human dermal fibroblasts with supernatants from UV-B-irradiated epidermal cells.    SETTING: Photobiological research …
6474092	Mediterranean glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency--near normal decay of the mutant enzyme protein in circulating erythrocytes.	aging	1984-08-??	Complete removal of leucocytes and platelets from erythrocytes and the development of a sensitized procedure for the assay of G6PD activity allowed the biochemical mechanisms of the Mediterranean variety of G6PD deficiency to be re-evaluated. Activity in the young erythrocytes from 9 G6PD-deficient subjects averaged 0.1% of the levels observed in the corresponding erythrocyte fraction from normal individuals: moreover, the decline of activity during aging of the G6PD-deficient erythrocytes was comparable with that observed for the normal enzyme. Mutant G6PD purified from granulocytes of a G6PD-deficient subject and entrapped within the corresponding erythrocytes was remarkably stable. Exposure of native erythrocytes to an oxidative stress (divicine plus ascorbate) resulted in a decrease of G6PD activity that was significantly more rapid and extensive in control than in G6PD-deficient cells. These results seem to exclude enhanced intracellular breakdown of the mutant protein within the …
19675556	Involvement of a forkhead transcription factor, FOXO1A, in UV-induced changes of collagen metabolism.	aging	2009-08-??	Transcription factors belonging to the forkhead box gene, group O (FOXOs) family have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of life-shortening effects of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway, which accelerates aging by suppressing FOXOs. Thus, FOXOs could hold the key for counteracting aging. Although FOXOs may play a critical role in aging, the effects of FOXOs on UV-induced changes of collagen metabolism by dermal fibroblasts are unknown. In this study, UV-induced changes in FOXO1a expression and the roles of FOXO1a in the regulation of collagen synthesis and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) expression in human dermal fibroblasts were investigated. In UVA- or UVB-irradiated fibroblasts, the expression of FOXO1A mRNA decreased significantly. The expression of type I collagen (COLIAI) also decreased. On the other hand, MMP-1 and MMP-2 mRNA levels increased. FOXO1A-small interfering RNA transfection induced the downregulation of FOXO1A expressio…

Recently in Neuron, Beckervordersandforth et al. (2017) report that adult neurogenesis requires mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation and that disrupting these pathways induces premature aging phenotypes.
30444781	Effects of Ultraviolet Irradiation on Cellular Senescence in Keratinocytes Versus Fibroblasts.	aging	2019-01-??	Aging is a biologic process characterized by time-dependent functional declines that are influenced by oxidative stress-induced inflammatory reactions. In particular, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation plays a key role in cellular senescence in photo-aged skin. However, the cellular senescence of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts by UV irradiation may differ depending on the exposure time and dosage of UV irradiation. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the effects of UV irradiation on cellular senescence in human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). After cell viability test, 200 mJ/cm UV irradiation was used in this study. To evaluate the reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species production, the levels of glutathione (GSH) and nitrite (NO2) were measured. We also performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase assay. An overall …
11204553	Rates of spontaneous reactivation and aging of acetylcholinesterase in human erythrocytes after inhibition by organophosphorus pesticides.	aging	2000-09-??	The in vitro rates of spontaneous reactivation and aging in human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were studied after inhibition by a dimethoxy (R1R2) and diethoxy substituted (R1R2) organophosphate pesticide (OP) of general structure R1R2P(O)X. These have been compared with data for human plasma cholinesterase previously reported using a similar methodology. A significantly slower rate of aging for erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was found compared to plasma cholinesterase, whether inhibited by dimethoxy or diethoxy substituted OPs. For diethoxy OPs the rate of spontaneous reactivation of the inhibited plasma enzyme was significantly slower than for the inhibited red cell enzyme. This acetylcholinesterase, and previously published plasma cholinesterase, data suggest that in practise a blood sample taken 30-40 h after significant acute OP exposure will still show inhibition in either plasma or erythrocyte cholinesterase when analysed, but that any inhibited plasma enzyme is more likel…
22622661	Mitochondrial autophagy and lipofuscin accumulation in aging odontoblasts.	aging	2012-07-??	Aging of long-lived post-mitotic cells is characterized as a progressive and irreversible reduction of functional activity. In such cells, mitochondria are organelles critical for bioenergetic supply, whose turnover is mediated by an autophagic-lysosomal pathway. In human teeth, odontoblasts are post-mitotic cells responsible for sensory function and dentin preservation. Here, human odontoblasts were processed for immunohistochemistry with antibodies against mitochondrial (MTCO2) and lysosomal (LAMP2) markers, and comparatively analyzed in two age groups (young-adult and adult) with light and electron microscopy. Selective engulfment of mitochondrial profiles into autophagic vacuoles is common in young-adult odontoblasts, suggesting a microautophagic pathway. With age, the odontoblast layer is reduced in width, and mitochondrial elements converge around large clusters of autofluorescent lipofuscin deposits. Age-related changes in odontoblasts are observed as a long-term process in whic…
27732642	Replicative Senescence in Human Fibroblasts Is Delayed by Hydrogen Sulfide in a NAMPT/SIRT1 Dependent Manner.	aging	2016-??-??	Recent evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has cytoprotective and anti-aging effects. However, the mechanisms for such properties are not fully understood. Here, we show that the expression of the main H2S producing enzyme, CBS, and production of H2S are coordinately diminished in replicative senescent adult human dermal fibroblasts. The reduced production of H2S falls within the same time-frame that the hallmarks of replicative senescence appear including accumulation of SA-β-Gal, enhanced expression of p16, p21, and RRM2B while the expression of RRM2, hTERT, SIRT1, NAMPT, and NAD/NADH ratio all fall. Exogenous H2S increases the expression of hTERT, NAMPT, SIRT1 and NAD/NADH ratio in treated cells. Moreover, H2S safeguards the expression of hTERT in a NAMPT and SIRT1 dependent manner and delays the onset of replicative senescence as evidenced by reduced accumulation of age associated SA-β-Gal and cessation of proliferation. Postponement of loss of cell proliferative capacity…

Expression of Nck, c-Crk, Grb2/Ash, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase p110 alpha and Werner's syndrome gene product WRN was noticeably reduced in late passage cells, showing a concurrent downregulation of a set of signaling molecules accompanying aging.
821292	Glycopeptides of erythrocyte membranes in some hematological disorders.	aging	1976-??-??	Red cell membrane glycopeptides of subjects suffering from different hematological disorders (PNH, hemolytic anemias, dyserythropoietic anemias and polycythemia vera) have been characterized. In most cases, except in polycythemia vera, a decrease of sialic acid and galactosamine was detected. The role of these alterations is discussed with regard to the decrease of membrane glycopeptides during physiological aging of the red cell.
7162221	A long-lived human diploid fibroblast line for cellular aging studies: applications in cell hybridization.	lifespan, aging	1982-11-??	We have isolated a diploid fibroblast culture from human fetal lung with an in vitro lifespan of about 100 population doublings. The culture grows very well at clonal densities and long-lived clones can be isolated for use in cellular aging studies. The longer in vitro lifespan of the culture has allowed us to isolate from it a clone, containing a dominant and recessive mutation, having significant remaining proliferative potential. The nature of the mutations will allow for hybrid selection, after fusion of the mutant clone with wild type human cells. The mass culture and clones derived from it provide a valuable resource for cell aging studies.
18462275	Telomeres and race: what can we learn about human biology from health differentials?	aging	2008-08-??	The advent of molecular technology that can be applied across large population samples has added--rather than reduced--complexity in the analysis of the intertwined effects of social history and heritable factors on health outcomes. The report by Hunt et al. in this issue of Aging Cell provides an example of the promises and dilemmas associated with this increased complexity.
24434040	Effect of exercise training on skeletal muscle cytokine expression in the elderly.	aging	2014-07-??	Aging is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exercise training, in addition to improving muscle function, reduces these circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Yet, few studies have evaluated changes in the expression of cytokines within skeletal muscle after exercise training. The aim of the current study was to examine the expression of cytokines both at rest and following a bout of isokinetic exercise performed before and after 12weeks of resistance exercise training in young (n=8, 20.3±0.8yr) and elderly men (n=8, 66.9±1.6yr). Protein expression of various cytokines was determined in muscle homogenates. The expression of MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-6 (which are traditionally classified as 'pro-inflammatory') increased substantially after acute exercise. By contrast, the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 increased only slightly (or not at all) after acute exercise. These responses were not significant…
2153179	Retinoic acid inhibits the production of collagenase by human epidermal keratinocytes.	aging	1990-01-??	Lattices made of collagen and fibroblasts can be used as dermal equivalents to grow human keratinocytes in vitro. When these cultures are performed in a medium containing delipidized serum, the lattice is eventually degraded by the growing epithelium. The digestion of the dermal equivalent is due to the secretion of a collagenase by the keratinocytes. This degradation does not occur in cultures containing total serum or supplemented with retinoic acid. We show in this paper that retinoic acid inhibits the secretion of this keratinocyte collagenase in a dose-dependent manner. In the light of this result, the possible involvement of collagenase inhibition in the therapeutic effect of retinoic acid in skin disorders and skin aging must be considered.
22119379	Anti-oxidative and anti-aging activities of 2-O-α-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid on human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2012-01-15	A stable ascorbic acid derivative, 2-O-α-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-2G), was evaluated and compared with ascorbic acid for its protective effect against cellular damage and senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Pretreatment with AA-2G for 72 h promoted the proliferation of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and protected against cell damage induced by H(2)O(2). In contrast, ascorbic acid increased the proliferation and protected against cell damage, only when culture medium containing ascorbic acid was replaced every 24 h during the pretreatment period. These results suggest that the effect of AA-2G is longer-lasting compared to that of ascorbic acid. Senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, a classical biomarker of cellular senescence, was increased in H(2)O(2)-exposed NHDF cells, but pretreatment or posttreatment with ascorbic acid or AA-2G significantly inhibited the increase in SA-β-gal levels. AA-2G was more potent than ascorbic acid in …
86606	Lipofuscin in human tongue muscle.	aging	1979-04-??	In a study of 107 tongue specimens lipofuscin granules were found to be present in the muscle fibers of 93% of the cases. The pigment was not found in young individuals under the age of 18 years. The pigmented granules, which were stored in clusters of different sizes at the nuclear poles, were PAS-positive, stained black or brown with the Masson-Fontana procedure, black with Sudan black, and strong purple-pink with Ziehl-Neelson staining; yellow autofluorescene was emitted in ultraviolet light. The morphology, histochemical reactions and autofluorescence of the pigmented granules were characteristics of the endogenous lipid pigment described as lipofuscin. Statistical analyses indicated a direct correlation between increase in quantity and distribution of the pigment and increase in age (P = 0.001), in both males and females. Accumulation of the pigment in the tongue with aging was found to be similar to that in the myocardium.
21670520	Increased monocytic adhesion by senescence in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	aging	2011-??-??	We investigated whether replicative senescence of endothelial cells contributed to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs at a population-doubling level of 30 (PDL30) divided much more slowly than those at PDL9. The percentage of SA-β-Gal-positive cells and the mRNA expression levels of PAI-1 and p21 at PDL30 were significantly higher than those at PDL9. The changes induced by aging were evaluated according to the mRNA expression level of genes related to the endothelial cell function. The expression level of many adhesion molecules promoting monocytic adhesion was significantly increased, and monocytic adhesion on HUVECs was found to be significantly promoted by aging. Monocytic adhesion is an essential early event in the development of atherosclerosis, and our results suggest that replicative senescence of the vascular endothelial cells induced increased expression of adhesion molecules. The consequent increase in monocytic adhe…
16897078	Non-invasive study of gelatinases in sun-exposed and unexposed healthy human skin based on measurements in stratum corneum.	aging	2006-10-??	Gelatinases, which belong to the family of matrix metalloproteinases, degrade various components of skin, and may be involved in photoaging, since they are upregulated by low-dose UV exposure to the skin. However, their behavior in healthy human skin is still unclear. In the present study, gelatinases was specifically detected in stratum corneum (SC) of skin from sun-exposed sites, including the face, in healthy humans, but not in SC of skin from unexposed sites. Following experimental UVB irradiation of the abdomen in volunteers, gelatinases were detected in tape-stripped SC from the site for several weeks, and subsequently disappeared. The appearance of gelatinase in SC after a lag time consistent with SC turnover is considered to reflect upregulation of gelatinase expression in keratinocytes in response to UVB-exposure of the skin. A survey of gelatinases in facial SC samples collected by tape-stripping from the cheeks of 100 healthy women revealed that the enzyme was present in 90%…
12473014	Total plasma homocysteine, age, systolic blood pressure, and cognitive performance in older people.	aging	2002-12-??	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) levels, blood pressure (BP) variables, renal function, and measures of cognitive performance in older people.    DESIGN: Initial cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort.    SETTING: United Kingdom (Oxfordshire) community sample.    PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-eight community-dwelling volunteers aged 60 to 91.    MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological tests (Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly-Cognitive Section (CAMCOG), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale), biochemical studies (tHcy, serum folate, vitamin B12, and serum cystatin C), BP, and other vascular risk factors.    RESULTS: tHcy, age, systolic BP (SBP), and CAMCOG performance were significantly interrelated. tHcy was negatively associated with total CAMCOG score independent of years of education, serum folate, vitamin B12, and cystatin C levels. Older participants with higher tHcy lev…
18419623	Erythrocyte vesiculation: a self-protective mechanism?	lifespan	2008-05-??	Previous studies demonstrated that 20% of haemoglobin is lost from circulating erythrocytes during their total lifespan by vesiculation. To study whether removal molecules other than membrane-bound haemoglobin were present in erythrocyte-derived vesicles, flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis were employed to examine the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) and IgG, and senescent cell antigens respectively. It was demonstrated that 67% of glycophorin A-positive vesicles exposed PS, and that half of these vesicles also contained IgG. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of a breakdown product of band 3 that reacted with antibodies directed against senescent erythrocyte antigen-associated band 3 sequences. In contrast, only the oldest erythrocytes contained senescent cell antigens and IgG, and only 0.1% of erythrocytes, of all ages, exposed PS. It was concluded that vesiculation constitutes a mechanism for the removal of erythrocyte membrane patches containing removal molecules, the…
26607666	N-Acylethanolamines Bind to SIRT6.	aging	2016-01-01	Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase enzyme that is involved in multiple molecular pathways related to aging. Initially, it was reported that SIRT6 selectively deacetylated H3K9Ac and H3K56Ac; however, it has more recently been shown to preferentially hydrolyze long-chain fatty acyl groups over acetyl groups in vitro. Subsequently, fatty acids were demonstrated to increase the catalytic activity of SIRT6. In this study, we investigated whether a series of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), quercetin, and luteolin could regulate SIRT6 activity. NAEs increased SIRT6 activity, with oleoylethanolamide having the strongest activity (EC50 value of 3.1 μm). Quercetin and luteolin were demonstrated to have dual functionality with respect to SIRT6 activity; namely, they inhibited SIRT6 activity with IC50 values of 24 and 2 μm, respectively, and stimulated SIRT6 activity more than sixfold (EC50 values of 990 and 270 μm, respectively).
15200954	The Werner syndrome helicase and exonuclease cooperate to resolve telomeric D loops in a manner regulated by TRF1 and TRF2.	aging	2004-06-18	Werner syndrome (WS) is characterized by features of premature aging and is caused by loss of the RecQ helicase protein WRN. WS fibroblasts display defects associated with telomere dysfunction, including accelerated telomere erosion and premature senescence. In yeast, RecQ helicases act in an alternative pathway for telomere lengthening (ALT) via homologous recombination. We found that WRN associates with telomeres when dissociation of telomeric D loops is likely during replication and recombination. In human ALT cells, WRN associates directly with telomeric DNA. The majority of TRF1/PCNA colocalizing foci contained WRN in live S phase ALT cells but not in telomerase-positive HeLa cells. Biochemically, the WRN helicase and 3' to 5' exonuclease act simultaneously and cooperate to release the 3' invading tail from a telomeric D loop in vitro. The telomere binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 limit digestion by WRN. We propose roles for WRN in dissociating telomeric structures in telomerase-def…
24009010	The effects of osteoarthritis and age on skeletal muscle strength, Na+-K+-ATPase content, gene and isoform expression.	aging	2013-11-??	Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disorder prevalent in older populations that is accompanied by declines in muscle mass, strength, and physical activity. In skeletal muscle, the Na(+)-K(+) pump (NKA) is pivotal in ion homeostasis and excitability and is modulated by disuse and exercise training. This study examined the effects of OA and aging on muscle NKA in 36 older adults (range 55-81 yr), including 19 with OA (69.9 ± 6.5 yr, mean ± SD) and 17 asymptomatic controls (CON, 66.8 ± 6.4 yr). Participants completed knee extensor strength testing and a physical activity questionnaire. A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was analyzed for NKA content ([(3)H]ouabain binding sites), α1-3- and β1-3-isoform protein abundance (immunoblotting), and mRNA (real-time RT-PCR). The association between age and NKA content was investigated within the OA and CON groups and in pooled data. The NKA content was also contrasted between subgroups below and above the median age of 68.5 yr. OA had lower s…
26171741	Nuclear stiffening and chromatin softening with progerin expression leads to an attenuated nuclear response to force.	aging	2015-08-28	Progerin is a mutant form of the nucleoskeletal protein lamin A, and its expression results in the rare premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Patients with HGPS demonstrate several characteristic signs of aging including cardiovascular and skeletal dysfunction. Cells from HGPS patients show several nuclear abnormalities including aberrant morphology, nuclear stiffening and loss of epigenetic modifications including heterochromatin territories. However, it is unclear why these changes disproportionately impact mechanically-responsive tissues. Using micropipette aspiration, we show that nuclei in progerin-expressing cells are stiffer than control cells. Conversely, our particle tracking reveals the nuclear interior becomes more compliant in cells from HGPS patients or with progerin expression, as consistent with decreased chromatin condensation as shown previously. Additionally, we find the nuclear interior is less responsive to external mechanical force f…
27732763	Vesicles in Nature and the Laboratory: Elucidation of Their Biological Properties and Synthesis of Increasingly Complex Synthetic Vesicles.	aging	2017-??-13	The important role of vesicles in many aspects of cell function is well-recognized, but only recently have sophisticated imaging techniques begun to reveal their ubiquity in nature. While we further our understanding of the biological properties of vesicles and their physiological functions, increasingly elegant artificial vesicles are being developed for a wide range of technological applications and basic research. Herein, we examine the state of the art of biological and synthetic vesicles and place their biological features in the context of recent synthetic developments, thus providing a unique overview of these complex and rapidly developing fields. The challenges and opportunities associated with future biological and synthetic studies of vesicles are also presented.
11164472	Hypothesis: loss of telomerase inducibility and subsequent replicative senescence in cultured human T cells is a result of altered costimulation.	lifespan	2000-12-20	Telomerase activity is upregulated after stimulation of human T cells, but as they progress through their finite culture lifespans, this ability is progressively lost. Upregulation of telomerase requires T cell stimulation through the antigen receptor (TCR) and through costimulatory receptors such as CD28. A hypothesis is put forward here that T cell signalling through the TCR is maintained throughout the lifespan of the clones, and that alterations in costimulatory signals are responsible for the progressive loss of telomerase induction. A minimal model of T cell activation during progression through the lifespan is presented in which the TCR provides an unchanging signal 1, but in which there is a progressive decrease in CD28 signalling (signal 2), as well as a decrease in other costimuli, which are here designated as signal 4 (via CD134) and 5 (via CD154). Moreover, in addition, increases in negative costimulation, here designated signal minus 2 (via CD152) and possibly via ICOS (si…
2423634	Amylase levels in semen and saliva stains.	aging	1986-04-??	Amylase levels were determined for 148 semen samples and 20 saliva samples as well as for their corresponding stains. The effect of aging on the detectability of amylase activity in these stains was also investigated. The Phadebas amylase test was used for the quantitative assay of amylase. High levels of amylase in fluid saliva resulted in high levels being detected in saliva stains. Lower levels present in most seminal fluids produce little or no detectable amounts of amylase in stains. Interpretations are made as to the possible sources of amylase activity found in stains from laboratory casework based on both the amylase concentration and the elapsed time between collection and analysis. The evidential value of the presence or absence of amylase activity in casework stains is also discussed.
9483489	Aging chromosome telomeres: parallel studies with terminal repeat and telomere associated DNA probes.	aging	1997-12-15	Human chromosome telomeres consist of tandemly repeated (TTAGGG)n sequences with variant and more complex telomere-associated DNA sequences proximal to the terminal repeats. Terminal restriction fragment (TRF) sizes have been evaluated by Southern blot analysis using a terminal repeat probe, (TTAGGG)3 that will simultaneously detect all telomeres and with a telomere-associated DNA probe, TelBamll, that identifies a specific sub-group of chromosome ends. For DNA extracted from in vitro aging fibroblasts, a progressive reduction in the size of the TRFs could be demonstrated using both probes. For both fibroblasts and adult lymphocyte DNA, there were differences in the size of the fragments detected with the two probes. Studies were carried out to determine whether this difference might, in part, be attributable to variability in terminal repeat lengths as well as heterogeneity in the location of terminal restriction enzyme recognition sites. Using the (TTAGGG)3 probe to identify all telo…
20682014	Aging affects the phenotypic characteristics of human periodontal ligament cells and the cellular response to hormonal stimulation in vitro.	aging	2010-12-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aging modulates the proliferative activity and organic matrix production of cells in vivo and in vitro. Here, we explore how aging affects the phenotypic characteristics of human periodontal ligament cells and their response to hormonal stimulation.    MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifth passage periodontal ligament cells from subjects aged 12-14 (group 1), 41-55 (group 2) and 61-70 years (group 3) were characterized for the expression of mesenchymal marker genes and proteins by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Confluent cultures were exposed to 10(-12) m parathyroid hormone(1-34) [PTH(1-34)] intermittently for three cycles. At harvest, cell number, alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production were determined by cell count, biochemical assay and ELISA.    RESULTS: The characterization of the cells revealed a decreased expression of osteoblast-specific marker genes along with a lower percentage of cells presenting the respective proteins with age. An inter…
8557021	Assessment of dietary phylloquinone intake and vitamin K status in postmenopausal women.	aging	1995-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between dietary phylloquinone intake and vitamin K status of postmenopausal Caucasian women.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, in which dietary intake was estimated using weighed record techniques and vitamin K status was measured by a single plasma phylloquinone concentration and 24-h urinary gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) excretion.    SETTING: The metabolic research unit at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, Boston, MA.    SUBJECTS: 402 healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women who were participating in a randomized trial to determine the effect of calcium supplementation on bone loss. Of the original group, 362 had complete weighed diet records, 358 had corresponding plasma phylloquinone concentrations, and 346 had corresponding urinary Gla measurements.    RESULTS: There was a significant correlation (r = 0.13, P = 0.01) between total dietary intake of phylloquinone (geometric mean = 89 micrograms…
8334030	Fat fraction of lumbar bone marrow using in vivo proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	aging	????-??-??	Localized proton spectra of the human lumbar vertebral body were recorded in vivo at 1.5 T, using the STEAM (stimulated echo acquisition mode) pulse sequence. Thirty-seven patients (18 men, 19 women) were examined, ranging in age from 21 to 68 years (mean = 40, SD = 13). The fat fraction of the bone marrow was calculated from the areas of the fat and water peaks in the spectrum. The results demonstrate that, in the course of aging, there is a systematic increase in measured fat percentage of about 7% per decade of age. No sex difference could be established on the basis of our results.
3581017	Protein and amino acid metabolism and requirements in older persons.	aging	1987-05-??	In this short review, some aspects of body protein and amino-acid metabolism during aging in human subjects have been explored. There is a progressive diminution of total body protein with aging, due largely to a decline in the size of the skeletal muscle mass. These changes are accompanied by a shift in the overall pattern of whole body protein synthesis and breakdown, with muscle mass estimated to account for about 30 per cent of whole body protein turnover in the young adult, as compared with a lower value of 20 per cent or less in the elderly subject. Because skeletal muscle mass plays an important role in the response of body protein and amino-acid metabolism to stress, such as infection and trauma, this decline in the contribution of muscle to total body protein metabolism might be a factor responsible for the reduced ability of older people to withstand unfavorable circumstances. The determination of the dietary requirements for individual essential amino acids and for total pro…
1212437	Ferrokinetics and erythropoiesis in man: the measurement of effective erythropoiesis, ineffective erythropoiesis and red cell lifespan using 59Fe.	lifespan	1975-09-??	Existing ferrokinetic methods do not provide a direct and quantitative measurement of effective and ineffective red cell production. A new method is described for calculating the daily uptake of iron by maturing red cells and the mean red cell lifespan. Ineffective erythropoiesis and non-erythroid iron turnover are also measured. The method involves standard laboratory techniques but the analysis requires access to a computer. The preliminary results suggest that it will be a clinically useful tool for the investigation of erythroid disorders.
17329011	Biochemical determinations of arylsulphatase A activity and sulphatide concentrations in decidua of women at 41 and 42 weeks of gestation.	aging	2007-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate arylsulphatase A activity and sulphatide concentrations in decidua of women at 41 and 42 weeks of gestation.    STUDY DESIGN: Enzyme activity and sulphatide concentrations were determined by biochemical procedures on samples of women at 41 and 42 weeks of gestation; thin-layer chromatography was also prepared to separate and visualize sulphatides and other lipid fractions.    RESULTS: The spectrophotometric values of arylsulphatase A showed very low values at 41 weeks, which reduced to a half at 42 weeks of gestation, while values of sulphatide concentrations increased in 42 weeks.    CONCLUSIONS: The behavior of two parameters examined could be due to the amount of placental estriol reduction, because of sudden placental aging.
27090168	STED super-resolution imaging of mitochondria labeled with TMRM in living cells.	aging	2016-??-??	We applied stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging with subdiffraction resolution to submitochondrial structures in mitochondria. Their shapes depend on both a cell's type and its physiological state. Staining with a cationic fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), unveiled intriguing details of lamellar structure, consisting of rapidly changeable, curtain-like formations. The TMRM-positive structure colocalized with neither proteins in the matrix nor on the outer membrane, but partially localized with the nucleoid. Suppression of a component in the mitochondrial contact site disrupted the lamellar TMRM-positive structure. Uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation system released TMRM from the inner membrane without any alteration in the matrix structure. STED images further showed that complexes of the electron transport chain are located on the surface of TMRM-positive structures. The approach presented here provides novel insights into the in vivo nature of…
2009	Biochemical and electrophoretic studies of erythrocyte pyridoxine kinase in white and black Americans.	aging	1976-01-??	The mean PNK activity in red blood cells from black subjects was only about 40% of that in whites. Among 51 whites examined, one was found to have enzyme deficiency. The estimated gene frequencies for PNKH (the common allele in whites which codes for higher enzyme activity) and PNKL (the common allele in blacks which codes for lower enzyme activity) were .35 and .65, respectively, for black donors, and .81 and .19, respectively, for white donors, The variant enzyme in persons with enzyme deficiency was associated with an increased rate of degradation in red cells during aging. No other biochemical or electrophoretic differences were detected.
28771081	Effect of Exercise on Inflammatory Profile of Older Persons: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.	aging	2018-??-01	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins increase with aging, promoting a chronic low-grade inflammation. Studies have shown a positive effect of exercise on inflammatory markers in older persons. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the main biomarkers investigated. However, it is unclear if exercise could decrease all these biomarkers.    PURPOSE: The aim was to analyze the effect of chronic exercise on IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP levels in older persons.    METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were adopted. Original articles that investigated the effect of chronic exercise on inflammatory profile of the elderly persons were eligible for this review. The databases PubMed, PEDro, EBSCO, and BioMed Central were searched. Three reviewers evaluated each publication for reducing bias. Data about IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were collected and analyzed. A standardized mean difference bas…
24378361	Collecting saliva and measuring salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase in frail community residing older adults via family caregivers.	aging	2013-12-18	Salivary measures have emerged in bio-behavioral research that are easy-to-collect, minimally invasive, and relatively inexpensive biologic markers of stress. This article we present the steps for collection and analysis of two salivary assays in research with frail, community residing older adults-salivary cortisol and salivary alpha amylase. The field of salivary bioscience is rapidly advancing and the purpose of this presentation is to provide an update on the developments for investigators interested in integrating these measures into research on aging. Strategies are presented for instructing family caregivers in collecting saliva in the home, and for conducting laboratory analyses of salivary analytes that have demonstrated feasibility, high compliance, and yield quality specimens. The protocol for sample collection includes: (1) consistent use of collection materials; (2) standardized methods that promote adherence and minimize subject burden; and (3) procedures for controlling …
18771289	Intrinsic ssDNA annealing activity in the C-terminal region of WRN.	aging	2008-09-30	Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in humans characterized by premature aging and genetic instability. WS is caused by mutations in the WRN gene, which encodes a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. Cellular and biochemical studies suggest that WRN plays roles in DNA replication, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, and homologous recombination and that WRN has multiple enzymatic activities including 3' to 5' exonuclease, 3' to 5' helicase, and ssDNA annealing. The goal of this study was to map and further characterize the ssDNA annealing activity of WRN. Enzymatic studies using truncated forms of WRN identified a C-terminal 79 amino acid region between the RQC and the HRDC domains (aa1072-1150) that is required for ssDNA annealing activity. Deletion of the region reduced or eliminated ssDNA annealing activity of the WRN protein. Furthermore, the activity appears to correlate with DNA binding and oligomerization status of the protein.
10974019	c-Jun-dependent inhibition of cutaneous procollagen transcription following ultraviolet irradiation is reversed by all-trans retinoic acid.	aging	2000-09-??	The aged appearance of skin following repeated exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation stems largely from damage to cutaneous connective tissue, which is composed primarily of type I and type III collagens. We report here that a single exposure to UV irradiation causes significant loss of procollagen synthesis in human skin. Expression of type I and type III procollagens is substantially reduced within 24 hours after a single UV exposure, even at UV doses that cause only minimal skin reddening. Daily UV exposures over 4 days result in sustained reductions of both type I and type III procollagen protein levels for at least 24 hours after the final UV exposure. UV inhibition of type I procollagen synthesis is mediated in part by c-Jun, which is induced by UV irradiation and interferes with procollagen transcription. Pretreatment of human skin in vivo with all-trans retinoic acid inhibits UV induction of c-Jun and protects skin against loss of procollagen synthesis. We have reporte…
29421845	Effects of Repeated UVA Irradiation on Human Skin Fibroblasts Embedded in 3D Tense Collagen Matrix.	aging	2018-??-??	Skin photoaging is caused by cumulative UVA exposure that leads to dermal matrix alterations associated with impaired fibroblast functions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of repeated UVA irradiation on mechanically stressed fibroblasts which were embedded in 3D tense collagen matrix. By comparison to 2D monolayer culture, we investigated the expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) cytoskeleton and α2 subunit of integrin receptors, as well as the collagen metabolism, focusing to MMP-1 and collagen type-I expressions. We found that UVA exposure reduces collagen levels in both culture conditions. However, concerning integrin α2 and α-SMA expression, UVA irradiation had no effect on 2D culture, whereas in tense 3D culture, it had an inhibitory effect. In UVA-irradiated 3D culture, fibroblasts acquired elongated shape and lost their dynamic interaction with collagen fibers through a decrease in integrin α2 and α-SMA. Fibroblast responses to UVA irradiation were different i…
24674756	PPM1B depletion induces premature senescence in human IMR-90 fibroblasts.	aging	2014-06-??	p53 and NF-κB are key transcription factors in regulating the gene expression program of cellular and organismal senescence. PPM1B is a member of the protein phosphatase 2C family and plays a role in negatively regulating p53 and NF-κB thereby possibly attenuating the gene expression program of cellular senescence. Here, possible involvement of PPM1B in replicative senescence has been investigated using the in vitro aging model of IMR-90 cells. PPM1B protein levels are progressively decreased in a replicative age-dependent manner. Importantly, PPM1B depletion induces a robust senescence phenotype as evidenced by significant growth arrest and senescence marker expression. Given that PPM1B depletion-induced senescence is partially rescued by inactivating p38 MAPK, our results identify PPM1B as a critical regulator of both p38 MAPK-dependent and independent senescence pathways during normal cellular aging process.
7488585	Preparation of Bruch's membrane and analysis of the age-related changes in the structural collagens.	aging	1995-10-??	AIMS/BACKGROUND: The morphological changes in Bruch's membrane and its constituent collagen seen during aging have been studied extensively but the chemical nature of the collagen and any aging changes have not previously been evaluated.    METHODS: A method for preparing purified Bruch's membrane from human cadaver eyes by dissection preceded by trypsin digestion was developed. Following pepsin digestion, the constituent collagens were analysed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting. Cyanogen bromide digestion was used to ascertain the solubility of the collagen and the proportion of type I to type III collagen. After hydrolysis of Bruch's membrane samples the constituent amino acids and collagen crosslinks were measured.    RESULTS: The presence of collagen types I, III, IV, and V in Bruch's membrane was confirmed. The proportion of type III collagen as a percentage of total fibrous collagens was calculated as being between 35% and 39%, with no significant difference between different mac…
26777764	Influence of Periodontal Clinical Status on Salivary Levels of Glutathione Reductase.	aging	2016-06-??	BACKGROUND: Inadequate antioxidant balance may play a role in the excessive tissue breakdown in periodontitis. Because aggressive periodontitis (AgP) not only differs from chronic periodontitis (CP) in terms of clinical manifestations, this study investigates whether the salivary levels of glutathione reductase (GR) may be linked with periodontal status.    METHODS: Saliva samples from patients with CP (n = 121), patients with AgP (n = 18), and healthy controls (n = 69) were collected. Periodontal status was assessed by criteria based on probing depth, clinical attachment level, and extent and severity of periodontal breakdown. GR salivary levels were analyzed by spectrophotometry. The association among GR concentration and CP or AgP was analyzed individually and adjusted for confounding using multivariate binary logistic regression models.    RESULTS: GR levels not only differed significantly between the two periodontitis groups, being significantly greater in patients with AgP, but a…
7628547	Senescence-dependent regulation of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor in human vascular endothelial cells.	aging	1995-07-??	Type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is the primary inhibitor plasminogen activator and has been found to be increased in a number of clinical conditions generally defined as prothrombotic. Since in aging and in atherosclerosis the changes observed in the endothelium resemble those of in vitro aged endothelial cells, we have examined the expression of PAI-1 in cells at different population doublings. In senescent endothelial cells, PAI-1 mRNA and protein are constitutively high, but uninducible by exogenous interleukin 1 alpha as well as by the phorbol ester TPA. Interestingly the increase of PAI-1 levels correlates with the upregulation of interleukin 1 alpha, which characterizes endothelial cell senescence. Since PAI-1 expression is not increased in young cells made nondividing by contact inhibition, we anticipate that PAI-1 expression can be used as an appropriate marker of endothelial senescence. Moreover, PAI-1 was not upregulated in senescent or in progeric human fibrob…
17050374	Red blood cells in the metabolism of nitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite.	aging	2006-10-??	In this review we have analyzed the reactions of nitric oxide (.NO) with superoxide radical (O(2).-) at the vascular compartment which results in limitation of the bioavailability of .NO and the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a strong oxidant species. The intravascular formation of peroxynitrite can result in oxidative modifications of plasma and vessel wall proteins including the formation of protein-3-nitrotyrosine. The role of red blood cells (RBC) and oxyhemoglobin in the metabolism of intravascular peroxynitrite will be discussed. While RBC constitute an important 'sink' of both .NO and peroxynitrite, redox reactions of these species with oxyhemoglobin may in part contribute to erythrocyte aging. The intravascular formation, reactions and detoxification of peroxynitrite are revealed as important factors controlling vascular dysfunction and degeneration in a variety of pathophysiologically-relevant conditions.
9922124	Premature induction of aging in sublethally H2O2-treated young MRC5 fibroblasts correlates with increased glutathione peroxidase levels and resistance to DNA breakage.	aging	1998-09-15	Human MRC5 fibroblasts, at different passages in cultures, were used as an in vitro model to assess variations and/or induction of aging parameters under basal conditions or following sublethal oxidative stress by H2O2. DNA sensitivities to oxidatively-induced breakage, rather than basal levels of damaged DNA, were significantly different between cultures at low and high population doubling level (PDL): old cells maintained most of their DNA integrity even at high concentrations of H2O2, while young cells showed more extensive DNA damage which developed in a dose-dependent fashion. However, young cells pretreated with low doses of H2O2 exhibited increased resistance against further oxidative damage to DNA thus reproducing a senescent-like profile of sensitivity. In turn, DNA from old cultures incubated in a NAD precursor-free medium was more prone to H2O2-induced strand breaks mimicking DNA sensitivity of young cells. The extent of oxidatively-induced DNA damage in MRC5 populations cor…
10733097	Increased expression of the tetraspanins CD53 and CD63 on apoptotic human neutrophils.	aging	2000-03-??	The recently discovered tetraspanin superfamily comprises a group of cell-surface proteins that are suggested to be involved in cell activation and signal transduction as well as in cell adhesion, motility, and metastasis. In this study, we have assessed the expression of two tetraspanins, CD53 and CD63, and two principal leukocyte adhesion molecules, CD11b and CD62L, on human apoptotic neutrophils. After aging of human neutrophils for 20 and 40 h in vitro, apoptosis was analyzed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. The binding of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD11b, CD62L, CD53, and CD63 on apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells was determined by dual-color flow cytometry. Aging of neutrophils in vitro resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) down-regulation of expression of the selectin CD62L, and a significantly increased expression of the two tetraspanins CD53 and CD63. The selective analysis of apoptotic versus nonapoptotic cells proved that both the increased expression of the …
8806439	Modulation of hemopoietic factor production in relation to endothelial cell aging by interleukin-1 induction.	aging	1996-08-01	In this study, we examined the modulation of hemopoietic factor production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in relation to aging and the cell cycle under conditions of interleukin-1 (IL-1) induction and noninduction. Under conditions of IL-1 noninduction, messenger RNA expression levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were three times higher in non-S-phase cells of young cultures than those in S-phase cells. Expression levels decreased in non-S-phase cells of old culture and approached levels similar to that of S-phase cells. The expression of neither E-selectin nor erythropoietin (Epo) was detected in cells from the noninduced state. The expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not affected by either cellular aging or the cell cycle; however, the amount of product secreted increased significantly in old cells, suggesting that G-CSF production is under posttranscriptional regulation. Under conditions of IL-1 induction G-CSF and M-CSF expr…
28192961	Raman and Infrared Spectroscopy Distinguishing Replicative Senescent from Proliferating Primary Human Fibroblast Cells by Detecting Spectral Differences Mainly Due to Biomolecular Alterations.	aging	2017-??-07	Cellular senescence is a terminal cell cycle arrested state, assumed to be involved in tumor suppression. We studied four human fibroblast cell strains (BJ, MRC-5, IMR-90, and WI-38) from proliferation into senescence. Cells were investigated by label-free vibrational Raman and infrared spectroscopy, following their transition into replicative senescence. During the transition into senescence, we observed rather similar biomolecular abundances in all four cell strains and between proliferating and senescent cells; however, in the four aging cell strains, we found common molecular differences dominated by protein and lipid modifications. Hence, aging induces a change in the appearance of biomolecules (including degradation and storage of waste) rather than in their amount present in the cells. For all fibroblast strains combined, the partial least squares-linear discriminant analysis (PLS-LDA) model resulted in 75% and 81% accuracy for the Raman and infrared (IR) data, respectively. Wit…
7237975	Hemolytic anemia and sulfhemoglobinemia due to phenacetin abuse: a case with multivisceral adverse effects.	aging	1981-04-??	The authors report a case of recurrent sulfhemoglobinemia resulting from a chronic abuse of phenacetin. Cyanosis was accompanied by hemolytic anemia and numerous features of tissue aging. While phenacetin was found to be the oxidizing drug, no source of sulfur was identified. The origin of sulfhemoglobinemia in man is discussed and the possible role of intraerythrocytic glutathione is emphasized.
12904570	Diverse dealings of the Werner helicase/nuclease.	aging	2003-08-06	The human Werner syndrome is a model for the process of aging. The protein that is mutated in Werner syndrome, WRN, exhibits three catalytic activities: a 3'-to-5' helicase, a 3'-to-5' exonuclease, and an adenosine triphosphatase activity. WRN interacts with a variety of proteins and has been implicated in many aspects of DNA metabolism. A recent paper by Chen et al. published in the August 2003 issue of Aging Cell sheds some light on the multifunctional nature of WRN. It suggests that WRN may be considered as a structural protein, providing a plausible conceptual basis for the many WRN protein-protein interactions.
28105719	Allostatic load and biological anthropology.	longevity, lifespan	2017-01-??	Multiple stressors affect developing and adult organisms, thereby partly structuring their phenotypes. Determining how stressors influence health, well-being, and longevity in human and nonhuman primate populations are major foci within biological anthropology. Although much effort has been devoted to examining responses to multiple environmental and sociocultural stressors, no holistic metric to measure stress-related physiological dysfunction has been widely applied within biological anthropology. Researchers from disciplines outside anthropology are using allostatic load indices (ALIs) to estimate such dysregulation and examine life-long outcomes of stressor exposures, including morbidity and mortality. Following allostasis theory, allostatic load represents accumulated physiological and somatic damage secondary to stressors and senescent processes experienced over the lifespan. ALIs estimate this wear-and-tear using a composite of biomarkers representing neuroendocrine, cardiovascu…
313541	Tissue culture of adult human neurons.	aging	1979-02-??	Dissociated neurons from adult human trigeminal and superior cervical ganglia were cultured in vitro for more than 2 months. Immediately after dissociation by incubation in 0.06% collagenase for 15--18 h, the cultures consisted of single neurons or clumps of neurons and degenerating fragments of myelinated or non-myelinated axons. After 7--10 days, bipolar Schwann cells, large neurons and fine nerve fibers were observed. Electron microscopic examination of these neurons revealed all the ultrastructural features of healthy adult neurons including those of lipofuscin pigments. By electrophysiological technique, extracellular recording to action potentials generated by these neurons were obtained indicating the neurons were alive and healthy. The availability of adult human neurons in culture should provide a model system for investigation related to the pathomechanism of lipofuscin formation and aging in general.
20049504	Histone deacetylase controls adult stem cell aging by balancing the expression of polycomb genes and jumonji domain containing 3.	aging	2010-04-??	Aging is linked to loss of the self-renewal capacity of adult stem cells. Here, we observed that human multipotent stem cells (MSCs) underwent cellular senescence in vitro. Decreased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs), followed by downregulation of polycomb group genes (PcGs), such as BMI1, EZH2 and SUZ12, and by upregulation of jumonji domain containing 3 (JMJD3), was observed in senescent MSCs. Similarly, HDAC inhibitors induced cellular senescence through downregulation of PcGs and upregulation of JMJD3. Regulation of PcGs was associated with HDAC inhibitor-induced hypophosphorylation of RB, which causes RB to bind to and decrease the transcriptional activity of E2F. JMJD3 expression regulation was dependant on histone acetylation status at its promoter regions. A histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor prevented replicative senescence of MSCs. These results suggest that HDAC activity might be important for MSC self-renewal by balancing PcGs and JMJD3 expression, which gov…
22466350	Relative contributions of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia to the risk of metabolic syndrome in midlife women.	aging	2012-06-??	CONTEXT: Young reproductive-age women with irregular menses and androgen excess are at high risk for unfavorable metabolic profile; however, recent data suggest that menstrual regularity and hyperandrogenism improve with aging in affected women approaching menopause.    OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether women with hyperandrogenemia (HA) and a history of oligomenorrhea (Oligo) are at an elevated risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) at the early stages of menopausal transition.    METHODS: Baseline data from 2543 participants (mean age of 45.8 yr) in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation were analyzed. Women with a lifetime history of more than one 3-month interval of nongestational and nonlactational amenorrhea were classified as having a history of Oligo. The highest tertile of serum testosterone was used to define HA. Women with normal serum androgens and eumenorrhea were used as the reference group. Logistic regression models generated adjusted odds…
8747493	Characterization of mitochondrial DNA in primary cardiomyopathies.	aging	1995-12-29	With the aim of studying the involvement of the mitochondrial genome in the impairment of heart function, mitochondrial DNA was analyzed by modified primer shift-polymerase chain reaction in a panel of young patients affected by primary cardiomyopathies. Mitochondrial DNA molecules harboring the 7436 bp deletion were specifically found in cardiomyopathic patients as compared with a panel of control subjects. The 4977 bp deletion was commonly detected among the subjects analyzed whereas none of the specific tRNA gene point mutations generally associated with the cardiomyopathic trait were detected. The presence of the 7436 bp deletion as a consequence of a premature aging of the heart muscle, secondary to heart dysfunction, is discussed.
23193996	Contribution of CYP2E1 polymorphism to aging in the mechanical workshop workers.	aging	2013-05-??	Aging is attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. Occupational exposure is one of the environmental factors with potential genotoxic effects. Researchers try to determine factors involved in genetic damages at hazards exposure that could accelerate aging. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) gene contributes in activation and detoxification of the environmental hazards. This polymorphism plays an important role in susceptibility of inter-individuals to DNA damage at the occupational exposure. The current study evaluated the possible influence of this gene polymorphism in aging by genomic damages through the biomarkers alterations of micronuclei (MN), comet tail length and telomere length shortening at the exposure. In this study, buccal cells were collected from the oral cavity of exposed workers and non-exposed controls. The CYP2E1 genotypes were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The wild genotype significantly affected MN …
3624486	Identification of high affinity folate binding proteins in human erythrocyte membranes.	aging	1987-09-??	Mature human erythrocyte membranes contained specific, high affinity (Kd 3.3 X 10(-11) M) folate binding moieties. Folate binding was pH, time- and temperature-dependent, saturable, and was much greater for pteroylmonoglutamate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate than 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and amethopterin. On detergent solubilization of membranes, two peaks of specific folate binding with Mr greater than or equal to 200,000 and 160,000 were identified on Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography in Triton X-100, and this corresponded to two similar peaks of immunoprecipitated material when solubilized iodinated membranes were probed with anti-human placental folate receptor antiserum. Age-dependent separation of erythrocytes by Stractan density gradients revealed a sevenfold greater folate binding capacity in membranes purified from younger compared with aged erythrocytes. Since this difference was not reflected in proportionately higher immunoreactive folate binding protein, (as dete…
28368203	Daily interactions with aging parents and adult children: Associations with negative affect and diurnal cortisol.	aging	2017-09-??	Midlife adults report greater investment in their children than in their parents, and these ties have important implications for well-being. To date, little research has addressed daily experiences in these ties. The present study examines daily experiences (negative and positive) with aging parents and adult children and their associations with daily negative affect and diurnal cortisol rhythms. Participants were middle-aged adults (N = 156; 56% women) from Wave 2 of the Family Exchanges Study, conducted in 2013, who completed a 7-day daily diary study, which included assessments of daily negative and positive social encounters and negative affect, and 4 days of saliva collection, which was collected 3 times a day (upon waking, 30 min after waking, and at bedtime) and assayed for cortisol. Multilevel models revealed that individuals were more likely to have contact with adult children than with parents but more likely to have negative experiences (negative interactions, avoidance, neg…
8864060	Replicative senescence, aging and growth-regulatory transcription factors.	aging	????-??-??	Normal somatic cells invariably enter a state of permanent growth arrest and altered function after a finite number of divisions. This phenomenon is termed cellular or replicative senescence. Replicative senescence is thought to be a tumor-suppressive mechanism, and a contributing factor in aging. Three features distinguish senescent from presenescent cells: an irreversible block to cell proliferation, increased resistance to apoptotic death, and changes in differentiated functions. Senescence entails an altered pattern of gene expression, much of which is due to altered transcription. At least three growth regulatory transcriptional modulators are repressed in senescent cells: the c-fos component of the AP1 transcription factor, the Id1 and Id2 helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins that negatively regulate basic HLH transcription factors, and the E2F-1 component of the E2F transcription factor. Failure to express any one of these modulators is very likely sufficient to arrest cell prolifera…
23235539	Depletion of nuclear histone H2A variants is associated with chronic DNA damage signaling upon drug-evoked senescence of human somatic cells.	aging	2012-11-??	Cellular senescence is associated with global chromatin changes, altered gene expression, and activation of chronic DNA damage signaling. These events ultimately lead to morphological and physiological transformations in primary cells. In this study, we show that chronic DNA damage signals caused by genotoxic stress impact the expression of histones H2A family members and lead to their depletion in the nuclei of senescent human fibroblasts. Our data reinforce the hypothesis that progressive chromatin destabilization may lead to the loss of epigenetic information and impaired cellular function associated with chronic DNA damage upon drug-evoked senescence. We propose that changes in the histone biosynthesis and chromatin assembly may directly contribute to cellular aging. In addition, we also outline the method that allows for quantitative and unbiased measurement of these changes.
655163	Heat-labile enzymes in circulating erythrocytes of a progeria family.	aging	1978-03-??	Cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with progeria contain an increased fraction of heat-labile enzymes and other altered proteins. To determine whether freshly obtained cells are similarly affected, erythrocytes from a progeric female and her clinically normal parents were analyzed for heat-lability of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Hemolysates of the child's whole erythrocyte populations and young erythrocytes isolated by equilibrium density centrifugation contained significantly higher heat-labile fractions of both enzymes compared to control hemolysates. Values in both parents were intermediate to those of their daughter and controls, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance in this family. The primary source of these multiple protein defects is unknown but may reside in a mutant gene producing abnormal protein turnover or defective DNA repair. An increased fraction of thermolabile enzymes in circulating erythrocytes should be usef…
3757268	Glutathione-linked enzyme activities in red cell aging.	aging	1986-08-30	The enzyme activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in normal human red cells separated centrifugally in a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll. Activities of G6PD, GSH-Px and GR decreased with red cell aging.
19359734	Microcalorimetric study of human blood lymphocytes culture at presence of copper, cadmium and prostamax.	aging	2009-03-??	Research goal was study of separate and joint influence of bioregulator prostamax and Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions on the chromatin structure in situ. The thermal characteristics of the denaturation process of blood lymphocytes culture of aging people in the presence of some microg quantities of Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions have been determined. It has been shown that Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions at these low concentrations don't influence on the temperature stability of membrane, nuclear and cytoplasm proteins. It has been shown that Cu(II) ions cause an additional condensation of the heterochromatin, and Cd(II) ions cause decondensation of heterochromatin and its partial denaturation.
29779019	Small extracellular vesicles and their miRNA cargo are anti-apoptotic members of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.	aging	2018-??-19	Loss of functionality during aging of cells and organisms is caused and accompanied by altered cell-to-cell communication and signalling. One factor thereby is the chronic accumulation of senescent cells and the concomitant senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that contributes to microenvironment remodelling and a pro-inflammatory status. While protein based SASP factors have been well characterized, little is known about small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their miRNA cargo. Therefore, we analysed secretion of sEVs from senescent human dermal fibroblasts and catalogued the therein contained miRNAs. We observed a four-fold increase of sEVs, with a concomitant increase of >80% of all cargo miRNAs. The most abundantly secreted miRNAs were predicted to collectively target mRNAs of pro-apoptotic proteins, and indeed, senescent cell derived sEVs exerted anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, we identified senescence-specific differences in miRNA composition of sEVs, with an i…
278977	Racemization in human lens: evidence of rapid insolubilization of specific polypeptides in cataract formation.	aging	1978-08-??	After early life, the dry weight of normal human lenses increases at a relatively constant rate with time. Transformation from soluble to insoluble material appears to occur at a comparable rate, resulting in a constant amount of soluble material. However, in cataract the insolubilization rate is accelerated. These observations are supported by determination of D-aspartic acid/L-aspartic acid ratios. The abundance of D-aspartic acid increases with aging at a constant rate in the insoluble fraction of normal lenses but does not change in the soluble fraction. However, in cataractous lenses there is a significant decrease in the ratio in the insoluble fraction. Examination of polypeptides isolated from reduced and alkylated soluble and insoluble cataractous lens proteins as well as other data suggest the following additional conclusions: (i) the 10,000-dalton polypeptide in the insoluble fraction is derived in part from degradation of an already insoluble precursor; and (ii) the lowered …
178178	Red cell uridine monophosphate kinase: effects of red cell aging on the activity of two UMPK gene products.	aging	1976-03-??	We have previously reported that uridine monophosphate kinase (UMPK) is genetically polymorphic in man, and that the UMPK2 gene product has less activity than that of UMPK1 when measured in normal red cells. In this paper we present evidence that the activity of UMPK, like that of many other enzymes, declines during red cell aging, and that the lower activity of UMPK 2, as compared with UMPK 1, is best explained by its more rapid catabolism.
18216864	Systematic expression profiling of innate immune genes defines a complex pattern of immunosenescence in peripheral and intestinal leukocytes.	aging	2008-03-??	Immunosenescence is characterized by a quantitative decline of adequate immune responses, which renders the elderly individual particularly susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. Whereas changes of the aging adaptive immune system (for example, reduced immunoglobulin secretion) have been extensively characterized, alterations of the innate immune system are still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine mRNA expression levels of innate immune genes and proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral and intestinal leukocytes of subjects of different ages. In both, whole blood samples and in colonic biopsies most of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) transcript levels were significantly downregulated in elderly subjects (90-99 years). Older individuals, when compared to the younger, exhibited an increased expression and/or secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by peripheral a…
4531015	Extension of the lifespan of cultured normal human diploid cells by vitamin E.	lifespan, aging	1974-12-??	Inclusion of vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol) in the culture medium for human diploid cells greatly prolongs their in vitro lifespan. The addition of 100 mug of DL-alpha-tocopherol per ml of medium has allowed us to culture WI-38 cells for more than 100 population doublings to date. (These cells normally have an in vitro lifespan of 50 +/- 10 population doublings.) Cells at the 100th population doubling have a normal diploid karyotype, appear to behave in all other respects like young WI-38 cells, and are still actively dividing. We interpret this result as support for the free radical theory of aging.
16300485	Apoptosis resistance of senescent human fibroblasts is correlated with the absence of nuclear IGFBP-3.	aging	2005-12-??	Signaling through the insulin/IGF axis plays a major role in determining the rate of aging in many species. IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) modulate the IGF pathway in higher organisms. IGFBP-3 accumulates in conditioned medium of senescent human fibroblasts, suggesting that it may contribute to the senescent phenotype. IGFBP-3 can enhance apoptotic cell death in tumor cells due to its ability to target intracellular regulators of apoptosis, including nuclear transcription factors. Senescent fibroblasts are highly resistant to apoptosis, suggesting that IGFBP-3 fails to induce apoptosis in this cell type; however, mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in senescent cells are poorly understood. To address this question, we studied the production and intracellular localization of IGFBP-3 in senescent fibroblasts. Whereas IGFBP-3 is highly overexpressed by senescent fibroblasts, IGFBP-3 was not detectable in the nucleus of senescent fibroblasts. In tumor cells, IGFBP-3 can be internalized by en…
1464416	Are adrenal and testicular androgen levels correlated?	aging	1992-10-??	To investigate the reported correlation between adrenal and testicular serum androgen levels, testosterone, DHEAS and androstenedione were measured in the serum of 92 healthy young males. Testosterone and androstenedione were found to have a weak but statistically significant correlation, while no correlation existed between testosterone and DHEAS, or DHEAS and androstenedione. These results indicate that although common steroidogenic pathways lead to androgen synthesis in both adrenals and testes, the regulation of steroid production in these glands is influenced by different factors. The correlation of testosterone with androstenedione can be attributed to their peripheral interconversion as well as to the fact that half of androstenedione is of testicular origin. Various other aspects of the androgen regulation mechanism such as ACTH stimulation and the role of aging, are presented and discussed.
20116426	Lipofuscin-bound iron is a major intracellular source of oxidants: role in senescent cells.	aging	2010-04-15	Aging is accompanied by an intracellular accumulation of lipofuscin, a hydrophobic yellow-brownish material that accumulates especially in the lysosomal compartment, where it can be neither degraded nor exocytosed from the cell. The intracellular effects of accumulating lipofuscin are still a subject of speculation. In addition to the demonstrated inhibition of the proteasome, it was proposed that lipofuscin is cytotoxic because of its ability to incorporate transition metals such as copper and iron, resulting in a redox-active surface, able to catalyze the Fenton reaction. This characteristic of lipofuscin may contribute to an increased level of radical formation and oxidatively modified cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and RNA/DNA, which has been shown to be extensive in aging cells. In this study for the first time the lipofuscin-mediated formation of oxidants and the role of iron in this process are directly shown in a model of senescent fibroblasts, as well as in vitr…
9301271	Distribution of macromolecular components in the muscle-bone junction of human masticatory muscles.	aging	1997-05-??	At the muscle-bone junction, the attachment is composed of macromolecular components that differ from those in masticatory muscles. In the temporal and lateral pterygoid muscles, numerous fine fibers form complex arrangements between collagenous bundles and the tendon-bone junctions. Collagenous bundles are directly inserted into the bone tissue at the site of the adhesive attachment. Reticular fibers are arranged irregularly and cover the collagenous bundles as a network. Numerous collagenous fibers are also tightly connected with the bundles that are found near the muscle-bone junction of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Strong or moderate staining for collagen types I, III, and V, tenascin, laminin, and fibronectin was observed in close association with the border of the bone matrix. Different distributions of these macromolecular components were found in each masticatory muscle. The results suggest that the morphological properties of the muscle-bone junction of each muscle reflect th…
3830390	Coagulation in the elderly.	aging	1985-11-??	The elderly have few bleeding disorders related exclusively to the aging process. However, abnormalities of coagulation are seen frequently in this group as complications of other illnesses. Thus a good understanding of basic coagulation physiology and testing will provide the necessary tools for therapeutic guidance.
19734575	Effect of UVA irradiation on proliferation and NO/iNOS system of human skin fibroblast.	aging	2009-08-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of different dosages of ultraviolet A (UVA) on the proliferation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) system of human skin fibroblasts and to study the mechanism of skin photoaging.    METHODS: Fibroblasts from normal skin cultured in vitro were irradiated with 1, 5, and 10 J/cm(2) of UVA, respectively. The proliferation activity, expression of iNOS mRNA/protein and NO production of human skin fibroblasts at different time points after irradiation of different dosages of UVA were measured by MTT assay, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and Griess reaction, respectively.    RESULTS: The survival rate of normal fibroblasts with time increase during 72 h. Low level of iNOS mRNA/protein expression and NO production was detected in normal human skin fibroblasts. But at each time point after 5 and 10 J/cm(2) dosage of UVA, the decrease of cell survival rate and the increase of iNOS mRNA/protein expression and NO production became more sign…
16386941	Thinking with your gonads: testosterone and cognition.	aging	2006-02-??	Sex hormones play a crucial role during brain development, but do they modulate or maintain cognition throughout life? Despite several million prescriptions annually for testosterone supplementation, we do not really know the answer. Here I review recent evidence that testosterone alters neural activity essential for learning and memory, and plays an important role as a neuroprotective agent in aging. In particular, testosterone deprivation is associated with poor memory in men and replacement can enhance memory and spatial cognition. However, there is little evidence that testosterone selectively affects only those cognitive domains where sex differences in performance have been found. There are also gaps in our knowledge surrounding the individual cognitive processes altered by testosterone, their neural basis, and the degree to which testosterone affects cognitive performance in women.
23769900	Sodium intake of special populations in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study.	aging	2013-10-??	OBJECTIVE: The sodium intake of participants of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study who were in three of the special population groups identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (those with hypertension, African Americans, and those ≥51years) was analyzed to determine if they met sodium recommendations.    METHODS: The sample included 2152 African American and White subjects, aged 30-64years. Major dietary sources of sodium for each group were determined from two 24-hour dietary recalls, and dietary intakes were compared with sodium recommendations. Dietary potassium was also evaluated.    RESULTS: The intakes of the groups studied exceeded 1500mg of sodium while their potassium intakes were lower than the Adequate Intake of 4700mg. The major contributors of sodium included "cold cuts, sausage, and franks," "protein foods," and yeast breads.    CONCLUSIONS: Excessive sodium intake characterized the diet of an urban, socioeconomically…
26381795	Correlation between in vitro expansion-related cell stiffening and differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells.	aging	????-??-??	Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are an attractive cell source for tissue regeneration, given their self-renewal and multilineage potential. However, they are present in only small percentages in human bone marrow, and are generally propagated in vitro prior to downstream use. Previous work has shown that hMSC propagation can lead to alterations in cell behavior and differentiation potency, yet optimization of differentiation based on starting cell elastic modulus is an area still under investigation. To further advance the knowledge in this field, hMSCs were cultured and routinely passaged on tissue-culture polystyrene to investigate the correlation between cell stiffening and differentiation potency during in vitro aging. Local cell elastic modulus was measured at every passage using atomic force microscopy indentation. At each passage, cells were induced to differentiate down myogenic and osteogenic paths. Cells induced to differentiate, as well as undifferentiated cells were as…
957802	Decreased unscheduled DNA synthesis in nondividing aged WI38 cells.	aging	????-??-??	The ability of cells from young and old cultures of WI38 human fibroblasts to undergo unscheduled DNA synthesis was studied. Following inhibition of semi-conservative synthesis in media lacking arginine and containing a hydroxyurea block, cells were irradiated with u.v. light and repair replication was measured by determination of specific activity of DNA and by autoradiography. Unscheduled DNA synthetic capacity was significantly reduced in old cultures. Quantitation of silver grains revealed that this reduction was a result of decreased repair activity by individual cells, which correlated well with a similar decrease in the proportion of dividing cells in the population. This observation that unscheduled DNA synthesis is reduced in older cells is in apparent contradiction to some earlier reports, and the failure of other investigators to identify aging changes in repair capacity is discussed in relation to differences in experimental procedure.
25531649	Long-term quiescent fibroblast cells transit into senescence.	lifespan, aging	2014-??-??	Cellular senescence is described to be a consequence of telomere erosion during the replicative life span of primary human cells. Quiescence should therefore not contribute to cellular aging but rather extend lifespan. Here we tested this hypothesis and demonstrate that cultured long-term quiescent human fibroblasts transit into senescence due to similar cellular mechanisms with similar dynamics and with a similar maximum life span as proliferating controls, even under physiological oxygen conditions. Both, long-term quiescent and senescent fibroblasts almost completely fail to undergo apoptosis. The transition of long-term quiescent fibroblasts into senescence is also independent of HES1 which protects short-term quiescent cells from becoming senescent. Most significantly, DNA damage accumulates during senescence as well as during long-term quiescence at physiological oxygen levels. We suggest that telomere-independent, potentially maintenance driven gradual induction of cellular sene…
28329785	Beet Root Juice: An Ergogenic Aid for Exercise and the Aging Brain.	aging	2017-09-01	Background: Exercise has positive neuroplastic effects on the aging brain. It has also been shown that ingestion of beet root juice (BRJ) increases blood flow to the brain and enhances exercise performance. Here, we examined whether there are synergistic effects of BRJ and exercise on neuroplasticity in the aging brain.    Methods: Peak metabolic equivalent (MET) capacity and resting-state magnetic resonance imaging functional brain network organization are reported on 26 older (mean age = 65.4 years) participants randomly assigned to 6 weeks of exercise + BRJ or exercise + placebo.    Results: Somatomotor community structure consistency was significantly enhanced in the exercise + BRJ group following the intervention (MBRJ = -2.27, SE = 0.145, MPlacebo = -2.89, SE = 0.156, p = .007). Differences in second-order connections between the somatomotor cortex and insular cortex were also significant; the exercise + BRJ group (M = 3.28, SE = 0.167) had a significantly lower number of connect…
23595168	Development of genetic counseling services in Taiwan.	aging	2013-12-??	Taiwan is an emerging industrial country in subtropical Asia with a population of 23 million. There were around 200,000 newborns in 2011. Delayed first marriage, low birth rate, and rapid aging are major demographic issues. Genetic counseling services were established following the rapid introduction of genetic technology and enactment of relevant laws and regulations. Ultrasound was first used in 1968 to examine pregnant women. The first amniotic fluid laboratory was founded in 1981 to identify chromosomal abnormalities. In 1984, the Genetic Health Act was legislated for prevention and control of genetic disorders, and the metabolic disorder screen project was launched. National Health Insurance with overall coverage of prenatal examinations was established in 1995. A master-level genetic counseling program was launched in 2003 and by 2011 has graduated eighty students. Two professional societies have been formed to certify genetic counselors, and 66 professionals have been certified.…
3760462	Serum levels of calcitonin in Cushing's syndrome.	aging	1986-06-??	Serum levels of calcitonin (CT) were studied in 21 patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS), 18 females and 3 males aging from 16 to 59 years, and in 70 age and sex matched normal subjects. Patients with CS showed CT values significantly lower than those found in controls (9.9 +/- 5.0 pg/ml vs. 15.9 +/- 6.3 pg/ml, mean +/- SD; p less than 0.01), while no difference was observed in total serum calcium and phosphate and calcium corrected for albumin. No correlation between CT and serum calcium and phosphate, serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol was found. It is possible that low CT levels are involved in the pathogenesis of bone loss observed in CS.
19026409	Relationship between plasma leptin level and brain structure in elderly: a voxel-based morphometric study.	aging	2009-06-01	BACKGROUND: Recent accumulating lines of evidence reveal that leptin is associated with synaptic plasticity and neuroprotective activity in the brain.    METHODS: In this preliminary study with a cross-sectional design, we examined the relationship between plasma leptin level and total or regional gray matter (GM) volume in 34 elderly subjects (mean age 64.5 years) with normal fasting glucose level and without dementia and metabolic syndrome by voxel-based morphometry of magnetic resonance imaging scans.    RESULTS: Plasma leptin level showed no significant correlation with total GM volume but showed a significantly positive correlation with GM volumes in the right hippocampus, left parahippocampus, and right cerebellum with adjustments for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio (W/H). Also, after adjustments for age, gender, BMI, W/H, and intracranial volume, plasma leptin level significantly positively correlated with GM volumes in the right hippocampus and bilate…
17978957	4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol in wines: estimating non-microbial sourced contributions and toxicological considerations.	aging	2007-11-??	Analyses of commercially available wines suggested non-Brettanomyces sources of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol. Grapes, enological additions, exposure to plastics, and oak-barrel aging were potential inputs considered. Investigations of whole grape bunch samples from two major red wine Vitis vinifera cultivars (L. cv. Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir), a commercial mannoprotein additive, and three commercial enological tannin additions indicated they are not likely significant sources of these compounds. Studies on 15 commercial oak barrelled red wines from six Vitis vinifera cultivars (L. cv. Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Dunkelfelder, Merlot, Pinot Meunier, and Pinot Noir), and a review of volatile phenol extraction from toasted oak wood, suggested that oak-aging may produce concentrations of up to 50 microg L(-1) 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol. Thus, following potential Brettanomyces-sourced aroma impacts in wine using 4-ethylphenol and/or 4-ethylguaiacol concentrations as …
20127999	In vitro enzymatic biodegradation of adhesive resin in the hybrid layer.	longevity, aging	2010-07-??	Penetration of adhesives into the demineralized dentin surface and their subsequent conversion are critically important to longevity of the adhesive resin (AR)-dentin bond. The durability of the resin-dentin bond is investigated by monitoring the change of adhesive concentration within the hybrid layer (HL) of aged specimens using Raman spectroscopy. Absolute molar concentrations of Bis-GMA and HEMA were measured across the HL of resin-dentin specimens 24 h after photopolymerization and after 24-week storage in one of three media: artificial saliva (SAL), SAL containing cholesterol esterase to attack resin (EST), and SAL containing bacterial collagenase to attack collagen (COL). No significant difference among these groups for both Bis-GMA and HEMA molar concentrations at 24-h storage was found; however, concentrations decreased from the AR to the middle of the HL. Concentrations remained unchanged at any resin-dentin position after aging in SAL. In the HL, concentrations significantly…
11459632	Interaction of the yeast Pso5/Rad16 and Sgs1 proteins: influences on DNA repair and aging.	aging	2001-08-09	The interaction trap method was used to isolate putative binding partners of Rad16/Pso5, a protein responsible for repair of silent DNA. One of the interactors found was Sgs1, a DNA helicase influencing the life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with homology to the human BLM, WRN and RECQL4 proteins. Using the same fusion proteins from the two-hybrid screening, we show evidence that both proteins also interact in vitro. We tested isogenic strains, containing mutant alleles of the two genes in single and double mutant combination, for phenotypic similarity. Life span in sgs1Delta single and sgs1Delta rad16Delta double mutants is about 40% of that of WT, and the rad16/pso5Delta single mutant also had its life span reduced to 75%. Sensitivity to different mutagens, whose lesions are poorly repaired in rad16/pso5Delta mutants, was tested in sgs1Delta mutants. The sgs1Delta conferred sensitivity to MMS, H2O2 and was moderately sensitive to UV(254nm) (UVC) and 4-NQO. An epistatic interactio…
19468695	Nutritional status of zinc in children with Down syndrome.	aging	2010-01-??	Experimental and clinical studies have established that zinc metabolism is altered in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). The present study intends to evaluate the nutritional status of zinc in children with DS by determining their biochemical and dietary parameters. The investigation was carried out on a group of children with DS (n = 35) and compared with a control group (n = 33), both aging between 4 and 11 years. Weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height indexes and diet were evaluated by using a 3-day dietary record. Zinc was evaluated in plasma, erythrocytes, and 24-h urine collection by using the method of atomic absorption spectroscopy. The frequency of short stature was higher in children with DS. Both groups presented high protein content, adequate concentrations of lipids and carbohydrates, and deficit in calories. Adequate zinc intake was observed in 40% of children with DS and in 67% of the control group. Zinc concentrations were significantly lower in plasma …
11388659	Source of endothelin-1 in subarachnoid hemorrhage.	aging	2001-04-??	Endothelin-1 is the most potent vasoconstrictor known to date. This peptide is believed to play a pathophysiological role in the development of vasospasm, the most important complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In the present study we investigated the release of endothelin-1 in SAH and analyzed the cellular source of this peptide. At a protein and mRNA level we were able to show that endothelin-1 is produced by mononuclear leukocytes. Complementary in vitro studies revealed that aging and subsequent hemolysis of blood is sufficient to induce production of endothelin-1 by mononuclear leukocytes. Thus, cerebrospinal fluid-derived mononuclear leukocytes are a source of endothelin-1 in patients suffering from SAH. This finding may have important therapeutic implications as anti-leukocyte strategies could prevent cerebrovascular complications in SAH patients.
29655760	Psidium cattleianum fruits: A review on its composition and bioactivity.	aging	2018-08-30	Psidium cattleianum Sabine, commonly known as araçá, is a Brazilian native fruit, which is very juicy, with sweet to sub acid pulp and a spicy touch. The fruit can be eaten fresh or processed into juice, jellies and ice creams. Araçás are source of vitamin C, minerals, fatty acids, polysaccharides, volatile compounds, carotenoids and phenolic compounds, which can provide nutrients and phytochemical agents with different biological functions. Different pharmacological studies demonstrate that P. cattleianum exerts antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antiaging effects. Thus, this article aims to review the chemical composition and biological effects reported for araçá fruit in the last years.
699897	Vitamin B6 metabolism in human red cells. I. Variations in normal subjects.	aging	1978-??-??	Physiologic and pharmacologic factors affecting intracellular red cell vitamin B6 metabolism in normal human subjects were studied using a new assay for pyridoxine kinase (PnK) together with saturated and total aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities as indirect indices of intracellular pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) availability. The presence of reduced PnK activity in Blacks was confirmed but this could not be explained on the basis of increased enzyme inactivation during red cell aging in vivo. Racial differences were also noted in the metabolism of AST and, in Caucasians, net dissociation of PLP from the apoprotein was demonstrated to occur in vivo. Despite the wide variation in Pn5 activity, AST levels were maintained within relatively narrow limits. However, when pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine were administered, PnK and AST activities increased proportionately. These findings suggest that when the supply of B6 vitamers is not limiting, PnK may play a role in regulating red ce…
10421490	Molecular cloning of neuropathy target esterase (NTE).	aging	1999-05-14	Covalent modification of NTE, a neuronal protein with serine esterase activity, by certain organophosphates (OP) initiates degeneration of long axons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Simple inhibition of NTE esterase activity does not initiate neuropathy; the latter requires aging of the OP bound to the catalytic serine residue so that a negatively-charged species is left attached to the active site. This may indicate that a non-esterase function of NTE is important for axonal maintenance. We have recently cloned NTE and shown that it is unrelated to any known serine hydrolases but contains a novel C-terminal domain which is conserved from bacteria to man. Furthermore, the catalytic serine is located within this domain at the centre of a helical hydrophobic segment of the polypeptide's secondary structure. The integrity of NTE would be severely compromised by the presence of a negatively-charged organophosphate moiety at this site. Implications for possible higher-order st…
17098331	Levodopa increases memory encoding and dopamine release in the striatum in the elderly.	aging	2008-02-??	Normal aging is associated with a decrease in dopaminergic function and a reduced ability to form new motor memories with training. This study examined the link between both phenomena. We hypothesized that levodopa would (a) ameliorate aging-dependent deficits in motor memory formation, and (b) increase dopamine availability at the dopamine type 2-like (D2) receptor during training in task-relevant brain structures. The effects of training plus levodopa (100mg, plus 25mg carbidopa) on motor memory formation and striatal dopamine availability were measured with [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) positron emission tomography (PET). We found that levodopa did not alter RAC-binding potential at rest but it enhanced training effects on motor memory formation as well as dopamine release in the dorsal caudate nucleus. Motor memory formation during training correlated with the increase of dopamine release in the caudate nucleus. These results demonstrate that levodopa may ameliorate dopamine deficiencies…
23296663	Detection of nuclear envelope alterations in senescence.	aging	2013-??-??	Gene mutations that cause defects in the nuclear envelope are responsible for progeroid syndromes, characterized by exacerbated cell senescence and accelerated aging. Consequently, morphological abnormalities of the nucleus represent a cellular phenotype whose analysis allows for both the characterization of the consequences of particular mutations and the assessment of the impact of approaches aimed at reversing their pathological effects. To obtain reliable results, systematic and reproducible procedures are required. Here, we describe a simple fluorescence microscopy-based protocol to detect nuclear envelope alterations in the study of cellular senescence.
4083158	Genome reorganization during aging of dividing cells.	lifespan, aging	1985-??-??	The study of the effect of low dose rate ionizing radiation on the long-term proliferation of fibroblasts led to the observation that radiation accentuated the growth potential of the cells, favoring events which normally take place during division. These events could be related to the genome reorganization taking place during division. Hence, it was hypothesized (Macieira-Coelho, 1979; Macieira-Coelho, 1980; Macieira-Coelho, 1981) that the long-term proliferation of fibroblasts depends upon the potential for reorganization of the genome, the latter being a self-limiting process. At each division residual quantitative and qualitative changes would accumulate in chromatin, limiting the long-term potential for further rearrangements. The hypothesis was checked looking for quantitative and qualitative changes in DNA through the in vitro lifespan of human fibroblast populations. It was found that at each population doubling in 20% of the cells there is unequal distribution of DNA between s…
11497191	Racial differences in resting end-tidal CO2 and circulating sodium pump inhibitor.	aging	2001-08-??	Previous studies have shown that high end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) is a marker for sodium sensitivity of blood pressure (BP) in White Americans, and that the BP of African Americans is more sensitive to high sodium intake than that of whites. The present study tested the hypothesis that resting PetCO2 is higher in normotensive African Americans than in whites. Resting end-tidal CO2 of 395 white and 125 African American participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging was monitored for 20 min with a respiratory gas monitor, and BP and heart rate were recorded every 5 min by oscillometric methodology. Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of a circulating sodium pump inhibitor marinobufagenin-like compound (MBG), which increases when plasma volume is expanded, was also analyzed by fluoroimmunoassay in racial groups. Mean resting PetCO2 of African American men was higher than that of white men (38.1+/-0.5 v 36.4+/-0.3 mm Hg), and resting PetCO2 of African American women was higher than th…
1121935	The effect of hydrocortisone on DNA synthesis and cell division during aging in vitro.	lifespan	1975-??-??	Hydrocortisone (14 muM) added to cultures of human diploid fibroblast-like cells extends the lifespan of the population. This effect is expressed during a single growth cycle by an increased rate of proliferation and a higher rate of incorporation of 3HdT into DNA. The hormone appears to exert its effect by increasing the fraction of cells in the proliferating pool, and this increase is expressed at all levels of serial subcultivation (population ages). The effect requires a minimum of between 12 and 18 hr exposure of the cells to hydrocortisone. Studies with varying amounts of serum suggest that the hormone affects the cells by amplifying the serum signal which is the primary signal for cell division.
1646740	Insulin receptor gene expression is reduced in cells from a progeric patient.	aging	1991-01-??	We have studied a 15-year-old girl (P1) suffering from the Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (progeria) associated with a severe insulin resistance. Insulin binding activity to P1 erythrocytes was 85% reduced when compared to that measured in ten normal controls matched for sex and age. This finding was confirmed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts and depends on a reduction in insulin receptor number. Also the amount of total insulin receptors, [35S]methionine labeled and immunoprecipitated, was 90% reduced in P1 lymphoblasts when compared to controls. Next, we measured insulin receptor mRNA levels and we found undetectable levels of insulin receptor transcript in P1 EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, in the absence of any rearrangement of insulin receptor gene as evaluated by Southern blot analysis. The marked reduction in insulin receptor gene expression probably accounts for the severe insulin resistance presented by the patient. Despite extensive studies, the molecular basis…
24857719	Increased number of chews during a fixed-amount meal suppresses postprandial appetite and modulates glycemic response in older males.	aging	2014-06-22	Aging is associated with a reduction in appetite. Older adults require a higher number of chews to form a bolus before swallowing. However, whether this ingestive behavior contributes to the reduced appetite in this population is unknown. Fifteen males aged 65 years or older participated in this randomized cross-over trial and attended two test sessions. After an overnight fast, they consumed a fixed-amount meal (2050 kJ) by chewing each portion of food 15 or 40 times before swallowing. Subjective appetite was measured using visual analogue scales at regular intervals for 3 h after completion of the meal. Blood samples were collected at the same time for measurement of glucose, insulin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Participants were provided an ad libitum meal 3 h later. Compared with 15 chews, chewing food 40 times before swallowing resulted in significantly lower postprandial hunger (P=0.003), preoccupation with food (P<0.001), and desire to eat (P<0.001). Plas…
22907062	The intracellular Ca²⁺ channels of membrane traffic.	aging	????-??-??	Regulation of organellar fusion and fission by Ca ( 2+)  has emerged as a central paradigm in intracellular membrane traffic. Originally formulated for Ca ( 2+) -driven SNARE-mediated exocytosis in the presynaptic terminals, it was later expanded to explain membrane traffic in other exocytic events within the endo-lysosomal system. The list of processes and conditions that depend on the intracellular membrane traffic includes aging, antigen and lipid processing, growth factor signaling and enzyme secretion. Characterization of the ion channels that regulate intracellular membrane fusion and fission promises novel pharmacological approaches in these processes when their function becomes aberrant. The recent identification of Ca ( 2+)  permeability through the intracellular ion channels comprising the mucolipin (TRPMLs) and the two-pore channels (TPCs) families pinpoints the candidates for the Ca ( 2+)  channel that drive intracellular membrane traffic. The present review summarizes the …
16154306	The limitations and validities of senescence associated-beta-galactosidase activity as an aging marker for human foreskin fibroblast Hs68 cells.	aging	2005-10-??	The senescence associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-betaG) assay has become one of the most commonly used markers of cell-aging. However, the reliability of the assay is questionable because the enzyme is a non-specific marker for cell-aging. In this study, we found that the SA-betaG activity increased with cell age as well as in confluent quiescent cells or cells under serum starvation, and in cells treated with H2O2. Importantly, we found that SA-betaG activity was irreversibly increased in the senescent cells or H2O2-teated cells, but was reversible in quiescent cells induced by serum starvation or confluence. Using fluorescein di-beta-d-galactopyranoside (FDG) method for SA-betaG detection, we showed that senescent human foreskin fibroblast Hs68 cells did not express a specific enzyme that has a maximal activity at pH 6.0. In the pH profile of the cellular betaG activity in senescent Hs68 cells, only a single peak was found (with maximum at pH 4.6), and no addition peak was found at o…
23929094	Digital image analysis of cells stained with the senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay.	aging	2013-??-??	Cellular senescence plays important roles in the aging process of complex organisms, in response to stress and in tumor suppression. Several markers can be used to identify senescent cells, of which the most widely used is the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SABG) activity. Here we describe a procedure for digital image analysis of cells stained by the SABG staining technique at pH 6 or at pH 4. This analysis is highly reproducible and sensitive to subtle differences in staining intensities resulting from diverse cellular senescence pathways in culture.
1280613	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) levels in Turner syndrome.	aging	1992-11-??	We tested whether IGFBP-1, a modulator of IGF-I action, would play a role in the pathogenesis of growth failure and metabolic picture of Turner syndrome. Fasting serum levels of IGFBP-1 were assessed in nineteen girls with Turner syndrome (aging 6.5 to 17.2 years) by radioimmunoassay. Our patients showed normal values of IGFBP-1 (mean +/- SD: 68.6 +/- 32.5 micrograms/l, range: 16 to 134 micrograms/l; range for age and pubertal stage-matched normal children: 15 to 180 micrograms/l). IGFBP-1 levels inversely correlated with bone age (p < 0.05), weight (p < 0.001), percentage of ideal body weight (p < 0.002) and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001). Our results seem to rule out a role of IGFBP-1 in the pathogenesis of growth failure in Turner syndrome. The close inverse relationship between IGFBP-1 levels and BMI suggests the serum concentrations of IGFBP-1 to be regulated by the nutritional status. Due to IGFBP-1 inhibiting action on IGF biological activity, the reduction of IGFBP-1 levels …
20435693	Is polycystic ovary syndrome an exception for reproductive aging?	lifespan, aging	2010-07-??	BACKGROUND: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting a delay in ovarian aging. We examined AMH levels in PCOS and normo-ovulatory women in a population-based cohort over a period of 10 years and used this information to estimate their menopausal age.    METHODS: Of a subset of 1002 non-menopausal women randomly selected from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, 85 cases of PCOS were diagnosed. We frequency-matched our control subjects with PCOS cases based on age and BMI. AMH levels were assessed at the time of recruitment (T1) and twice after that (T2 and T3). AMH levels were then plotted against age of the individual at the time of the measurement and the most appropriate model was selected. Menopause was calculated based on AMH levels below 0.2 ng/ml.    RESULTS: AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS cases compared with controls at the beginning of the study (5.58 +/- 3.64 versus 4.35 +/- 2.90 ng/ml, P = 0.03), but th…
1379586	Monoclonal antibodies recognizing protease-generated neoepitopes from cartilage proteoglycan degradation. Application to studies of human link protein cleavage by stromelysin.	aging	1992-08-15	Monoclonal antibodies were raised that specifically recognize the NH2-terminal neoepitope sequence present in link protein cleavage products derived from stromelysin-degraded proteoglycan aggregate. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using synthetic peptides as inhibitors, showed that one of these antibodies (CH-3) required, for antibody recognition, the free NH2-terminal amino acid isoleucine (residue 17 of the intact protein) in the sequence NH2-IQAENG at the stromelysin cleavage site of link protein 3. Human proteoglycan aggregate was digested with recombinant human stromelysin, bovine chymotrypsin, bovine trypsin, and porcine elastase, and their respective link protein degradation products were tested for immunoreactivity with antibody CH-3. Only stromelysin- and chymotrypsin-generated link protein 3 were recognized by antibody CH-3. Both of these enzymes generate link protein NH2 termini with the sequence 17IQAENG. . .; hence these studies indicated that monoclonal ant…
895008	Interrelations between age and plasma renin, aldosterone and cortisol, urinary catecholamines, and the body sodium/volume state in normal man.	aging	1977-08-01	Interrelations between age and plasma renin, aldosterone and cortisol levels, urinary catecholamiens, plasma and blood volumes, exchangeable body sodium and blood pressure wwere studied in 28 young (19 to 29 years), 16 middle-aged (32 to 58 years) and 15 elderly (60 to 74 years) healthy subjects. Supine and upright plasma renin and supine aldosterone levels decreased while urinary noradrenaline excretion rate increased progressively with aging (r= greater than 0.34; p less than 0.05), with significant differences in mean values between young and elderly subjects (p less than 0.02). There was also an age-related decrease in upright plasma aldosterone concentration, although this was no statistically significant. Furthermore, mean plasma cortisol concentrations increased in response to upright posture in elderly ( + 50%; p less than 0.02), but not in young ( --10%) or middle-aged ( --8%) subjects. Blood pressure correlated with age ( r =0.35; p less than 0.05) or noradrenaline excretion …
22119659	Ultraviolet-B irradiation induces epidermal up-regulation of heparanase expression and activity.	aging	2012-01-05	Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans are abundant components of basement membranes and cell surfaces where they are present associated with specific core-proteins to form proteoglycans, mainly perlecan, glypicans and syndecans. They play many roles such as modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, cell-matrix adhesion and assembly. It was previously shown that HS content decreases during skin aging. This decrease could be explained either by a decrease of HS synthesis or by an increased activity of its degrading enzyme, heparanase (Hpse-1). Since UV-B irradiation is one of the most important factor for skin photo-damage, we decided to study the effects of UV-B irradiation on heparanase expression and activity in human epidermal keratinocytes. Normal human keratinocytes and reconstructed epidermis were submitted to increasing doses of UV-B. HPSE1 mRNA levels were measured using real time PCR and heparanase enzymatic activity was quantified in human keratinocyte cultures u…
7407804	Individual variations of the seven carbohydrate components of human erythrocyte membrane during aging in vivo.	aging	1980-08-15	The contents of fucose, mannose, galactose, glucose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose and -D-galactose, and sialic acid, when the results were expressed as nmol per mg of membrane dry-weights, were found to be significantly lower in the membranes of old erythrocytes than in the membranes of young ones. No significant difference was found between young and old membranes when the compositions were expressed as residues per one hundred carbohydrate residues, suggesting that a homogeneous decrease of the carbohydrate moieties may occur during aging in vivo.
11707901	Longevity in vitro of human CD4+ T helper cell clones derived from young donors and elderly donors, or from progenitor cells: age-associated differences in cell surface molecule expression and cytokine secretion.	longevity, lifespan	2000-??-??	The effectiveness of the adaptive immune system relies upon extensive proliferation of an initially small number of antigen-specific T cells. At the end of a successful response, the majority die by apoptosis and a small minority joins the memory cell pool. Upon re-challenge with antigen, these memory cells must again undergo clonal expansion in order to mediate an effective response. Thus, T cells are subjected to marked proliferative stress which may result in clonal exhaustion due to replicative senescence. In other systems made up of rapidly proliferating cells (e.g. in the gut) individual clones are identical and are replaced at the end of their lifespan by differentiation from a stem cell reservoir. However, because of the unique clonal distribution of antigen receptors on T cells, mere replacement with other T cells is not sufficient to maintain the integrity of the system. Moreover, the very source of new T cells decreases with age (due to thymic involution). Therefore, the ada…
20457531	Unique expression pattern of human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase isozymes in red blood cells.	aging	2010-06-15	Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) catalyzes the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). In humans, three isozymes have been identified: NMNAT1, which is widely expressed in all tissues, NMNAT2 and NMNAT3, which show a tissue-specific expression and whose mRNA levels are generally lower compared to NMNAT1. In the present study we determined the individual NMNAT isozymes activity in human red blood cells (RBCs) by using a biochemical discrimination assay based on the distinctive catalytic properties of the three proteins. We found that isozyme 3 predominates over isozyme 1, whereas isozyme 2 is absent. This high prevalence of NMNAT3 is cell-aging independent and was also confirmed by analyzing the mRNA and protein levels. RBC represent the first human cell type with a remarkable predominance of NMNAT3, and this unique expression pattern is discussed in light of the catalytic properties of the isozymes and in consideration of the biochemical microenviro…
16912806	Image-based control of skin melanin texture.	aging	2006-09-01	We introduce a useful tool for controlling the skin melanin texture of facial photographs. Controlling the skin melanin texture is an important task in the reproduction of posters, TV commercials, movies, and so on. We used component maps of melanin, which were obtained by a previous method [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 16, 2169 (1999)] as the first processing step. We propose to control the melanin texture continuously and physiologically, based on the analysis of 123 skin textures in our database. The physiological validity for the change of the melanin texture is confirmed by comparing the synthesized image with an ultraviolet image, which can be used to predict the change of melanin texture due to aging. The control processes are implemented on programmable graphics hardware, and real-time processing is achieved for a facial videostream.
25306312	Beverages of lemon juice and exotic noni and papaya with potential for anticholinergic effects.	aging	2015-03-01	Lemon (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.) juice beverages enriched either with noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) (LN) or papaya (Carica papaya L.) (LP), were characterized by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS(n), the antioxidant capacity was evaluated by (DPPH·), superoxide (O2(·-)), hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) assays, and their potential as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors was also assessed. The fruits are rich in a wide range of bioactive phenolics. Regarding DPPH·, ·OH and HOCl assays, the LP displayed strong activity, and LN was the most active against O2(·-). Concerning cholinesterases, LP was the most active, mainly due to lemon juice contribution. The effect on the cholinesterases was not as strong as in previous reports on purified extracts, but the bioactive-rich beverages offer the possibility of dietary coadjutants for daily consumption of health-promoting substances by adults with aging-related cognitive or physical disorders.
20171366	Cysteine cathepsins in human dentin-pulp complex.	aging	2010-03-??	INTRODUCTION: Collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed by odontoblasts and present in dentin. We hypothesized that odontoblasts express other collagen-degrading enzymes such as cysteine cathepsins, and their activity would be present in dentin, because odontoblasts are known to express at least cathepsin D. Effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on cathepsin expression was also analyzed.    METHODS: Human odontoblasts and pulp tissue were cultured with and without TGF-beta, and cathepsin gene expression was analyzed with DNA microarrays. Dentin cathepsin and MMP activities were analyzed by degradation of respective specific fluorogenic substrates.    RESULTS: Both odontoblasts and pulp tissue demonstrated a wide range of cysteine cathepsin expression that gave minor responses to TGF-beta. Cathepsin and MMP activities were observed in all dentin samples, with significant negative correlations in their activities with tooth age.    CONCLUSIONS: Thes…
6284115	Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity as a determinant in human neurophysiology.	aging	1982-02-??	Several lines of evidence indicate that monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity can regulate levels of biogenic amines and neuronal activity in the nervous system. The two types of MAO activity, A and B, appear to have different domains of activity in the body. Brain tissue has both types of activity, although adrenergic neurons are thought to contain exclusively MAO-A. MAO activity can also be measured in peripheral tissues: MAO-A in cultured skin fibroblasts and placenta, and MAO-B in platelets and lymphocytes. These two types of activity are mediated by different enzyme molecules and are regulated independently by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetic determinants, hormones, and aging. In humans, inhibition of MAO-A activity leads to mood elevation in depressed patients; in contrast, low MAO-B activity in platelets has been associated with an increased susceptibility to psychopathology. In order to assess further the role of MAO activity in human mood and behavior, it will be …
21447413	Dietary vitamin K intake is associated with bone quantitative ultrasound measurements but not with bone peripheral biochemical markers in elderly men and women.	aging	2011-06-01	BACKGROUND: Vitamin K may have a protective role against bone loss and osteoporotic fractures associated to aging, although data in humans are inconsistent and the mechanisms involved are still unknown. The main objective of the study was to assess the associations between vitamin K intake, bone density, bone structure quality and biochemical bone metabolism markers in elderly subjects. We also analyzed the relationship between changes in vitamin K intake and the evolution of bone quality markers after two years of follow-up.    METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was carried out on 365 elderly subjects, 200 of whom were also included in a 2-year longitudinal follow-up study. Usual dietary intakes were assessed using a semi-quantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Vitamin K intake was estimated using the USDA database. Bone biochemical markers were measured in a subset of 125 subjects. Quantitative ultrasound assessment (QUS) was performed at the calcaneus to estimate bo…
2420184	The pathogenesis of hyaline arteriolosclerosis.	aging	1986-03-??	Although hyaline arteriolosclerosis is very common and has been of interest to pathologists for well over 100 years, its pathogenesis has never been determined. This study demonstrates that iC3b bound via an ester linkage to hydroxyl groups on the repeating disaccharide units of hyaluronic acid is a major component of arteriolar hyaline. The deposition of iC3b within the walls of arterioles appears to be due to slow spontaneous activation of the alternative complement pathway and random binding of metastable C3b to proximate hyaluronic acid within the arteriolar wall. Since hyaluronic acid does not activate the alternative complement pathway, bound C3b is rapidly inactivated by factors I and H to iC3b, which, along with factor H, remains bound to hyaluronic acid. The hyaline in some hyalinized arterioles also contains IgM and early and late classical complement pathway components. Indirect evidence suggests that the IgM represents immunoconglutinin, an autoantibody to neoantigens on iC…
20332807	Epigenetic regulation of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.	aging	2010-07-??	The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is an exception to a 'neurogenesis-unfriendly' environment of the adult brain. New functional neurons generated in this region contribute to learning and mood regulation, and thus represent a unique form of neural plasticity. The rate of hippocampal neurogenesis significantly changes on physiological or pathological influences, such as physical activity, environmental enrichment, stress, and aging. We suggest that epigenetic mechanisms could be sensors of environmental changes and fine modulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we examine the role of DNA methylation and methylation of core histones mediated by the Polycomb and Trithorax complexes in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. Given the recent surprising discovery of dynamic and reversible DNA methylation in the hippocampus, we speculate regarding its regulation and its role in adult neurogenesis.
6158523	Supranormal nuclear content of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in benign hyperplastic prostate of humans.	aging	1980-10-??	We investigated the concentration of nuclear and cytosolic 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 3 alpha-androstanediol in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. The endogenous content of the androgens was quantitated by radioimmunoassay after isolation of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions by classical differential centrifugation techniques. The mean dihydrotestosterone content was about four-fold higher (P < .01) than normal in the nuclear fraction and two-fold higher (P = .05) in the cytosolic fraction in periurethral tissue from hyperplastic prostates. The mean 3 alpha-androstanediol values were approximately one-third of normal in both the nuclear (P < .01) and cytosolic (P < .01) fractions in glands with BPH. In BPH tissue the ratios of dihydrotestosterone to androstanediol content in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions was significantly higher (P < .01) than the ratio in normal prostate. Our data suggest that elevated intranuclear dihydrotestosterone but not 3 alpha-androsta…
22449755	Distinct and complementary roles of papillary and reticular fibroblasts in skin morphogenesis and homeostasis.	aging	????-??-??	To study the biological properties of dermal fibroblast sub-populations, we used a reconstructed skin model with a dermal compartment populated with either papillary or reticular fibroblasts. The histological and immunohistological characterization of these reconstructed skins revealed distinct biological and structural differences, depending on the site-matched fibroblast population incorporated. Epidermal differentiation and maturation was favored and found optimum in the presence of papillary fibroblasts with little effect on ECM, as opposed to reticular fibroblasts, which had a significant positive effect on the production of the ECM molecules of the dermal epidermal junction and the dermis. In addition, the synthesis and release of MMPs and soluble factors like VEGF and KGF into the culture medium were influenced by the fibroblast population. MMP1 and VEGF were increased in the presence of papillary fibroblasts, whereas MMP3 and KGF levels were higher in the presence of reticular …
18567553	Estrogen and bone: insights from estrogen-resistant, aromatase-deficient, and normal men.	aging	2008-09-??	Findings from estrogen-resistant and aromatase-deficient men have provided important insights into the role of estrogen in the male skeleton during growth. Importantly, as reported elsewhere in this issue, these data also suggested dose-response relationships between estrogen and bone turnover. In addition, studies in these unusual patients have stimulated research on defining the role of estrogen in regulating bone metabolism in normal adult and aging men, providing further insights into estrogen regulation of bone metabolism not only in men, but also in women.
23436107	Calcium handling proteins: structure, function, and modulation by exercise.	aging	2014-03-??	Heart failure is a serious public health issue with a growing prevalence, and it is related with the aging of the population. Hypertension is identified as the main precursor of left ventricular hypertrophy and therefore can lead to diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. Scientific studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of the physical exercise by reducing the blood pressure and improving the functional status of the heart in hypertension. Several proteins are involved in the mobilization of calcium during the coupling excitation-contraction process in the heart among those are sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, phospholamban, calsequestrin, sodium-calcium exchanger, L-type calcium's channel, and ryanodine receptors. Our goal is to address the beneficial effects of exercise on the calcium handling proteins in a heart with hypertension.
20935705	Diffractive-optics-based sensor as a tool for detection of biocompatibility of titanium and titanium-doped hydrocarbon samples.	aging	2010-10-10	Adsorption of the elongated human plasma fibrinogen (HPF) and globular human serum albumin molecules on a titanium-based surface is monitored by analyzing permittivity and optical roughness of protein-modified surfaces by using a diffractive optical element (DOE)-based sensor and variable angle spectro-ellipsometry (VASE). Both DOE and VASE confirmed that fibrinogen forms a thicker and more packed surface adlayer compared to a more porous and weakly adsorbed albumin adlayer. A linear relation of the permittivity (ε(')) and dielectric loss (ε('')) was found for some of the dry titanium-doped hydrocarbon (TDHC) surfaces with excellent HPF adsorption ability. We discuss some aspects of TDHC's aging and its possible effects on fibrinogen adsorption.
17502159	Chondrogenic potential of human synovial mesenchymal stem cells in alginate.	aging	2007-10-??	OBJECTIVE: In a recent study, we demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the synovial membranes of bovine shoulder joints could differentiate into chondrocytes when cultured in alginate. The purpose of the present study was to establish the conditions under which synovial MSCs derived from aging human donors can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation using the same alginate system.    METHODS: MSCs were obtained by digesting the knee-joint synovial membranes of osteoarthritic human donors (aged 59-76 years), and expanded in monolayer cultures. The cells were then seeded at a numerical density of 4x10(6)/ml within discs of 2% alginate, which were cultured in serum-containing or serum-free medium (the latter being supplemented with 1% insulin, transferrin, selenium (ITS). The chondrogenic differentiation capacity of the cells was tested by exposing them to the morphogens transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, insulin-like grow…
22077644	Associations between serum homocysteine, holotranscobalamin, folate and cognition in the elderly: a longitudinal study.	aging	2012-02-??	OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between serum homocysteine (tHcy), holotranscobalamin (holoTC, the biologically active fraction of vitamin B12) and folate and cognitive functioning in a longitudinal population-based study of Finnish elderly subjects.    SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: tHcy, holoTC and folate were measured at baseline in 274 dementia-free subjects aged 65-79years from the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia study. Subjects were re-examined 7years later, and global cognition, episodic memory, executive functioning, verbal expression and psychomotor speed were assessed.    RESULTS: Higher baseline tHcy levels were associated with poorer performance in global cognition, relative difference: 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.99]; episodic memory: 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.99); executive functions: 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.98); and verbal expression: 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.97) at follow-up. Increased holoTC levels were related to better performance on global cognition: 1.…
2579854	Study of the peptidasic site of cholinesterase: preliminary results.	aging	1985-03-25	The peptidasic site of highly purified human plasma cholinesterase was investigated using active-site-directed inhibitors. Peptidase activity was assayed taking substance P as substrate. Inhibition by organophosphates indicated that the peptidasic site contained an active serine. The presence of essential histidine residues associated with serine was revealed by histidine modifications. Carboxyl group reagents showed that the active centre contained carboxyl groups in a non-polar environment. The removal of sialic acids did not alter peptidase activity. The peptidasic site of cholinesterase shared many properties with serine proteases sites and esteratic sites of cholinesterases. In addition, with the peptidasic site, as well as the esteratic site, there was always the possibility of 'aging' when inhibited by DFP or soman.
1643204	Increased hydrogen peroxide formation in platelets of patients affected with essential thrombocythaemia (ET).	aging	1992-06-??	The basal platelet level of reactive oxygen species and their enhancement following stimulation by different agonists were determined in a selected group of patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET). Activated platelets had lower levels of superoxide anion and higher intracellular concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than controls. Higher levels of lipid peroxidation induced by N-ethylmaleimide were also observed. Measurement of the most important enzymes generating and scavenging these reactive oxygen species revealed increased specific activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and superoxide dismutase and a decrease in platelet catalase activity in patients with ET. Since an abnormal production of oxygen radicals seems to be implicated in various pathological conditions and aging processes, the increased amount of hydrogen peroxide found in platelets of patients could be involved in some of the platelet alterations described in ET.
9325154	Down-regulation of Ku autoantigen, DNA-dependent protein kinase, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase during cellular senescence.	aging	1997-09-29	During aging and cellular senescence mutations accumulate in genomic and mitochondrial DNA. Ku autoantigens, DNA-dependent protein kinase, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase have an essential role in DNA damage recognition. Our purpose was to find out whether cellular senescence of fibroblasts affects the protein components that recognize DNA damage and induce the repair process. We compared presenescent and replicatively senescent human WI-38 fibroblasts with each other and with SV-40 immortalized and serum-deficient quiescent WI-38 cells. Our results showed that replicative senescence significantly decreased the nuclear level of both p70 and p86 components of Ku autoantigen. SV-40 immortalization and cellular quiescence did not affect the level of the p86 component but slightly increased that of p70. Both replicative senescence and cellular quiescence decreased the activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase in WI-38 fibroblasts. On the other hand, SV-40 immortalization increased the acti…
7575495	Origins of G1 arrest in senescent human fibroblasts.	lifespan, aging	1995-06-??	Human diploid fibroblasts have a finite proliferative lifespan in culture, at the end of which they are arrested with G1 phase DNA contents. Upon serum stimulation, senescent cells are deficient in carrying out a subset of early signal transduction events such as activation of protein kinase C and induction of c-fos. Later in G1, they uniformly fail to express late G1 genes whose products are required for DNA synthesis, implying that they are unable to pass the R point. Failure to pass the R point may occur because senescent cells are unable to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein, owing to the accumulation of inactive complexes of cyclin E/Cdk2 and possibly cyclin D/Cdk4. Senescent cells contain high amounts of p21, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose levels are also elevated in cells arrested in G1 following DNA damage, suggesting that both arrests might share a common mechanism. Cell aging is accompanied by a progressive shortening of chromosomal telomeres, which co…
703403	Unscheduled dna synthesis in confluent and mitotically arrested populations of aging human diploid fibroblasts.	lifespan	1978-10-??	Unscheduled DNA synthesis, used as a measure of excision repair following exposure to ultra-violet irradiation, was determined in confluent and arrested human diploid fibroblasts and correlated with in vitro age. Confluent cultures exhibited identical levels of unscheduled DNA synthesis at all in vitro ages. Cells arrested by lowering the serum concentration of the incubation medium exhibited similar levels of unscheduled DNA synthesis as did confluent cells during the first one-third of the cells' characteristic in vitro lifespan. During the last two-thirds of the lifespan, however, arrested populations exhibited a 30 to 50% increase in the amount of detectable DNA repair. This apparent increase in ability to perform unscheduled DNA synthesis was not time or dose dependent and could not be attributed to alterations in precursor pools. It was postulated that the increase may be correlated with changes in DNA structure.
10349116	Senescent erythrocytes: modification of rheologic properties, antigenic expression and interaction with monocytes.	lifespan	1999-??-??	Human erythrocytes have a well-defined lifespan of 120 days. Their eventual removal from circulation is a complex process affected by many cellular parameters, making them susceptible to sequestration in the spleen and other organs. The purpose of this study was to investigate putative changes in rheologic properties, antigenic expression and interaction with monocytes of senescent erythrocytes (SE). SE and young erythrocyte (YE) fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation from 20 healthy donor blood samples. Membrane rheomechanic properties (by diffractometric method), ABO and MN antigens reactivity and erythrophagocytosis by peripheral monocytes were investigated in each fractions. SE showed a little decrease in the deformability index and an increase of both membrane elastic modulus and surface viscosity. The studies performed indicate a decreased expression in the antigens of both blood group systems studied (p < 0.01) and an increased rate of erythrophagocytosis by mono…
8824885	Elevation in the ratio of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase to glutathione peroxidase activity induces features of cellular senescence and this effect is mediated by hydrogen peroxide.	aging	1996-02-??	Although reactive oxygen species have been proposed to play a major role in the aging process, the exact molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study we investigate the effects of a perturbation in the ratio of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase activity (Sod1 dismutases .O2-to H2O2) to glutathione peroxidase activity (Gpx1 catalyses H2O2 conversion to H2O) on cell growth and development. Our data demonstrate that Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an elevation in the ratio of Sod1 activity to Gpx1 activity produce higher levels of H2O2 and exhibit well characterised markers of cellular senescence viz. slower proliferation and altered morphology. On the contrary, Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an unaltered ratio in the activity of these two enzymes, have unaltered levels of H2O2 and fail to show characteristics of senescence. Furthermore, fibroblasts established from individuals with Down syndrome have an increase in the ratio of Sod1 to Gpx1 activity compared with correspondin…
6330714	Steroid use in the elderly. Guidelines for avoiding adverse effects.	aging	1984-07-??	The effects of aging on adrenal function should be considered when prescribing steroid for the elderly. For glucocorticoids, the changes of decreased production and decreased clearance are relatively balanced, resulting in levels that are still within the normal range. Responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress are not altered. However, androgens appear to be affected by an "adrenopause," the mechanism(s) and the clinical relevance of which remain to be elucidated. The risk/benefit factors in steroid use are always of utmost concern. The physician may consider lowering the steroid dose in elderly patients of asthenic build because of the diminution of muscle mass and plasma volume that occurs with aging. Despite the physiologic changes that accompany aging, steroid used carefully and appropriately can be both safe and effective in the elderly.
20820101	Hyaluronan used for intradermal injections is incorporated into the pericellular matrix and promotes proliferation in human skin fibroblasts in vitro.	aging	2010-??-??	BACKGROUND: Over the past decade injectable hyaluronan (HA) formulations have been widely used to decrease the visibility of skin aging. However, little basic research has been performed to address their effect on dermal skin fibroblasts.    OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether human skin fibroblasts are affected by exogenous non-cross-linked HA with respect to proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix composition.    METHODS: The effect of a non-cross-linked HA on proliferation, migration and gene expression of human dermal fibroblasts was determined. Furthermore, affinity histochemistry of pericellular HA was performed.    RESULTS: Proliferation was significantly stimulated by HA whereas migration was not affected. Importantly, exogenous HA was incorporated into fine HA filaments of the pericellular fibroblast matrix.    CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence that a HA formulation used in humans for cosmetic reasons stimulates fibroblast prolifer…
6634850	Changes in cholinergic activity in human hippocampus following chronic alcohol abuse.	aging	1983-??-??	Cholinergic mechanisms in the hippocampus seem to play a role in memory function. Since it is well known that chronic alcoholics often have a disturbed memory function, the cholinergic activity of the hippocampus has been measured in 20 chronic alcoholics and 14 controls, post-mortem. Of the alcoholics, 13 were classified as "intoxicated" alcoholics and 7 as "sober" alcoholics, i.e., without ethanol in blood or urine at the time of death. A lower, although not significantly lower activity of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, presynaptic marker) was measured in the hippocampus of the chronic alcoholics as compared to the control group. A trend towards a lower number of muscarine-like binding sites was also observed for the alcoholic group, but was only significant for the oldest group of alcoholics (59-68 years; -30%; p less than 0.01) in comparison to controls. No significant change in the number of nicotine-like binding sites was found. A normal aging process with degenerati…
26223259	High-Resolution Functional Connectivity Density: Hub Locations, Sensitivity, Specificity, Reproducibility, and Reliability.	aging	2016-??-??	Brain regions with high connectivity have high metabolic cost and their disruption is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified at the group-level local functional connectivity density ( L: FCD) hubs, network nodes with high degree of connectivity with neighboring regions, in occipito-parietal cortices. However, the individual patterns and the precision for the location of the hubs were limited by the restricted spatiotemporal resolution of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures collected at rest. In this work, we show that MRI datasets with higher spatiotemporal resolution (2-mm isotropic; 0.72 s), collected under the Human Connectome Project (HCP), provide a significantly higher precision for hub localization and for the first time reveal L: FCD patterns with gray matter (GM) specificity >96% and sensitivity >75%. High temporal resolution allowed effective 0.01-0.08 Hz band-pass filtering, significantly reducing spurious L: FCD effe…
9271783	The ratio of formation of prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 in HUVEC decreased in each subsequent passage.	aging	1997-07-??	In this study, we analyzed the antioxidative potential (SOD-, GSH-Px-activity) and the basal, H2O2- and ATP-stimulated formation of PGI2 and TXA2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) of different passages. The subcultivation of cells partly represents the process of aging. Both subcultivation of the cells and the H2O2 incubation did not significantly influence the activity of SOD and GSH-Px. H2O2 (0.1 mM and 1.0 mM) stimulated the generation of PGI2 and TXA2 in the cell passages time dependently. The formation ratio of PGI/TXA2 changed from 640:1 (0.1 mM H2O2) or 430:1 (1.0 mM H2O2, 40 min incubation) at the 1st passage, to 13:1 and 17:1, respectively, at the 4th passage. This resulted from the reduction of the PGI2 synthesis connected with more pronounced TXA2 formation. The same behavior was found in the basal and ATP-stimulated eicosanoid formation. Based on this, the age-dependent activation of the oxygen radical formation could be responsible for the modified eicosano…
22224424	Distribution and organoleptic impact of ethyl 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate enantiomers in wine.	aging	2012-02-15	The enantiomers of ethyl 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (ethyl dl-leucate) were assayed in several wines using chiral gas chromatography (γ-cyclodextrin). Analyses of 55 commercial wines from various vintages and origins revealed different distributions. Generally, white wines presented only the R form, whereas red wines contained both enantiomers, in various ratios according to aging. The highest levels of the S form were found in the oldest samples. The R/S average enantiomeric ratio of this compound in red wine was approximately 95:5 with an average total concentration of ∼400 μg/L. The olfactory threshold of R-ethyl 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (126 μg/L) in hydroalcoholic solution was almost twice that of the S form (55 μg/L). The olfactory threshold of a mixture of R- and S-ethyl 2-hydroxy-4-ethylpentanoate (95:5, m/m) in hydroalcoholic solution was 51 μg/L, suggesting that both enantiomeric forms contribute to perception of this compound in wine, resulting in a synergistic effect.…
16442310	High-level bacterial expression and purification of human SirT2 protein for NMR studies.	aging	2006-07-??	Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) proteins are a class of protein deacetylase enzymes that play key roles in transcriptional gene silencing, DNA repair, and aging. Here, we describe the high-level bacterial expression and purification of a human SirT2 construct that yields high resolution NMR spectra. By removing the N-terminal helix alpha0 and using Thioredoxin as a fusion partner, greater than 10 mg/L of purified protein can be obtained from minimal media. The protein is fully functional and enables NMR-based screening and structural studies of this important protein.
16916745	Hormonal homeostasis in a group of 216 aging Czech males and correlation with responses to a questionnaire of the University of St Louis.	aging	2006-06-??	UNLABELLED: The male aging process is accompanied by changes in the levels of several types of hormones. Falling levels of androgenic-anabolic steroids (total testosterone, free testosterone, biologically accessible testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) correspond to a group of symptoms referred to as PADAM syndrome (Partial Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male). In the case of those carefully examined patients with symptoms of PADAM and proven hypogonadism, administering androgen supplements can alleviate some of the undesirable manifestations. In its literature, the University of St Louis repeatedly refers to its questionnaire as a verbal tool for the detection of possible hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent the aging process is evident in hormonal homeostasis detected in laboratory testing, and the extent to which this data is in accord with the evaluation of responses to questions in the University of St Louis questionnaire.    METHOD: 216 men aged …
1483110	Modification of RBC properties by an autoantibody. Binding to RBC senescent antigen.	aging	????-??-??	It has been reported that natural antibodies alter aging RBCs, so increasing their vulnerability for removal from the blood stream. Results presented indicate that binding of anti-Gal, a natural antibody, to erythrocytes increases RBC rigidity in terms of microviscosity and deformability. Removal of RBCs from circulation could, at least in part, depend on these alterations.
15920626	Scanning electron microscopy analysis of aged Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells.	aging	2005-03-??	Most electron microscopy studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ultrastructure were performed in the 1950s and 1960s and lack high resolution by modern standards. This study was performed to re-evaluate the fine structure of M. tuberculosis using modern scanning electron microscopy. Bacteria were grown in rich medium with a constant supply of oxygen for several weeks. Results show that surface bleb-like structures accumulate as cultures age. The most unusual feature of aging M. tuberculosis cultures is that they develop extracellular fibrils, which could play roles of adhering cells to surfaces and to one another.
10400308	Effect of cellular aging on the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by mechanical stress in human periodontal ligament cells.	aging	1999-05-03	The production of prostaglandin (PGE2) in human periodontal ligament fibroblast (hPLF) cells is increased by mechanical stress, however, the age-related changes in the susceptibility of hPLF cells in response to mechanical stress remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of in vitro cellular aging on PGE2 production and the gene expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) in mechanically stressed hPLF cells. In vitro cellular aged hPLF cells were prepared by sequential subcultivations of hPLF cells from young healthy periodontal ligaments. In vitro cellular aged hPLF cells produced a significantly higher amount of PGE2, as compared with young hPLF cells, when the cells were exposed to cyclic tension force in a time- and magnitude-dependent manner. The COX-2 mRNA level in aged cells was higher than that in young cells, whereas COX-1 mRNA remained unchanged. Since PGE2 from hPLF cells was stimulated by in vitro aging as presented here, aging of hPLF cells may affect t…
10670786	Gender and age-related variation in adenylyl cyclase activity in the human prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and dorsal raphe nuclei.	aging	2000-01-21	The influence of gender and age on adenylyl cyclase activity was investigated, through a Dowex-alumina double step chromatographic procedure, in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and dorsal raphe nuclei obtained from autopsy cadavers. Results showed that forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity in raphe nuclei was greater in men than in women; a region-dependent rank order of basal, forskolin-induced adenylyl cyclase activity and percentage forskolin-stimulation was observed in women only. Lastly, basal values correlated positively with forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in all areas except the prefrontal cortex of the male subjects. Positive significant correlations were also found between both forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity and percentage forskolin stimulation and aging in the prefrontal cortex. Overall, the findings suggest that sex and/or age-related differences in brain adenylyl cyclase vary from one cerebral region to the other.
22093040	Methods for evaluation of cosmetic antioxidant capacity.	aging	2012-11-??	The skin as the largest part of human body is one of the main targets for ultraviolet radiation, environmental pollution, toxic chemicals and some metal ions, which share responsibility for the formation of free radicals. The resulting free radicals, both oxygen and nitrogen species are one of the main causes of aging due to impaired regulation of cell respiratory metabolism involving incomplete oxygen reduction in mitochondria and production a superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals et al. In modern cosmetology to minimize the adverse effects of free radicals, antioxidants, which inhibit free radical reactions, mainly autoxidation processes are used. Currently, not only many cosmetic products containing antioxidants are available, but a large diversity of methods for determination of cosmetics antioxidant activity is also accessible. These methods can be divided into three main groups: in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo as reported herein. Due to lack of standardization and validation it is n…
28053116	DNA-dependent protease activity of human Spartan facilitates replication of DNA-protein crosslink-containing DNA.	aging	2017-??-07	Mutations in SPARTAN are associated with early onset hepatocellular carcinoma and progeroid features. A regulatory function of Spartan has been implicated in DNA damage tolerance pathways such as translesion synthesis, but the exact function of the protein remained unclear. Here, we reveal the role of human Spartan in facilitating replication of DNA-protein crosslink-containing DNA. We found that purified Spartan has a DNA-dependent protease activity degrading certain proteins bound to DNA. In concert, Spartan is required for direct DPC removal in vivo; we also show that the protease Spartan facilitates repair of formaldehyde-induced DNA-protein crosslinks in later phases of replication using the bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU) comet assay. Moreover, DNA fibre assay indicates that formaldehyde-induced replication stress dramatically decreases the speed of replication fork movement in Spartan-deficient cells, which accumulate in the G2/M cell cycle phase. Finally, epistasis analysis mapped thes…
19428457	Telomere length in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.	aging	2009-06-??	Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disorder caused by mutations in the gene LMNA, which encodes the nuclear matrix protein lamin A. Previous research has shown that the average telomere length in fibroblasts from HGPS patients is shorter than in age-matched controls. How mutations in lamin A lead to shortened telomere lengths is not known nor is the contribution of individual chromosome ends to the low average length understood. To measure the telomere length of individual chromosomes, we used quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). In agreement with previous studies, we found that the average telomere length in HPGS fibroblasts is greatly reduced; however, the telomere length at chromosome ends was variable. In contrast, the telomere length in hematopoietic cells which typically do not express lamin A, was within the normal range for three out of four HGPS patient samples. Our results suggest that mutant lamin A decreases telomere l…
1464110	Glycation and insolubility of human lens protein.	aging	1992-10-??	To learn whether glycation plays a role in insolubilization or in senile cataractogenesis, the reactivity of lens protein from normal and senile cataractous lenses and individual crystallin prepared from human lens with various sugars [glucose, glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P), glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and fructose], and the insolubility of those proteins were determined. The reactivity of human lens protein to glucose was increased in a dose-dependent manner, and it was demonstrated that 17.9, 18.5 and 24 kDa proteins were susceptible to glycation with sugars. The study also showed that alpha-, beta-crystallins and high molecular weight (HMW) aggregate obtained from cataractous lens have some weak reactivity against sugars. It was demonstrated that the proteins obtained from normal lens of older age and from cataractous lenses have higher insolubilities to glucose than do normal younger ones. Measurement of glycosylated protein by affinity column chromatography revealed that cataractous…
8956967	Age dependency of nanosecond fluorescence characteristics in human arteries.	aging	1996-??-??	Human arteries fluoresce as a result of illumination by UV-light. The fluorescence characteristics of the human aorta and basilar artery were investigated with respect to aging. For this experiment, a time-resolved microscope fluorometer was employed. Resultant fluorescence decayed on a nanosecond scale when applying pulse UV-light. These fluorescences were found to be age dependent in the basilar artery; the fluorescence decay time decreased with increasing human age. However, fluorescence from the aorta did not show the age dependency.
23811562	Sauchinone, a lignan from Saururus chinensis, protects human skin keratinocytes against ultraviolet B-induced photoaging by regulating the oxidative defense system.	aging	2013-??-??	Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, which are responsible for collagenous extracellular matrix proteins breakdown in skin, causing photoaging. Sauchinone is reported to have various bioactivity such as antioxidative, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of sauchinone against UVB (50 mJ/cm(2))-induced photoaging in HaCaT human epidermal keratinocytes. Sauchinone, at 5-40 µM, significantly protected keratinocytes against UVB-induced damage as assessed by cell viability and toxicity assay. Additionally, sauchinone, at 20-40 µM, prevented the upregulation of MMP-1 proteins and reduction of type 1 collagen induced by UVB. Other assays revealed that, in keratinocytes, sauchinone decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increased glutathione levels and heme oxygenase-1. Sauchinone also inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein k…
698120	Erythropoiesis and mean red-cell lifespan in normal subjects and in patients with the anaemia of active rheumatoid arthritis.	lifespan	1978-07-??	Recently developed ferrokinetic methods offer a tool to measure effective and ineffective erythropoiesis and mean red-cell lifespan (Ricketts et al, 1975). We have used this tool to investigate erythropoiesis in normal subjects and in patients with the anaemia of active rheumatoid arthritis. In normal subjects the results are comparable with the results published by Cavill et al (1977). In patients with the anemia of active rheumatoid arthritis there appears to be a total and an effective red-cell production as in the normal subjects. The ineffective erythropoiesis in the patients is increased and the produced red cells have a shortened mean lifespan in the circulation. The increased ineffective erythropoiesis is probably due to inadequate supply of iron to the marrow and the shortened mean red-cell lifespan to an extra-corpuscular haemolytic factor. The impaired marrow response to the anaemia of active rheumatoid arthritis has been confirmed.
957804	A lack of correlation between decline in growth capacity and nuclear RNA synthesising activity in ageing human embryo cells in culture.	lifespan	????-??-??	A reduced proliferative capacity has been demonstrated between young (passage 5/24) and middle (passage 17/24) aged human embryo diploid fibroblast cultures. This difference was noted in both logarithmically growing and plateau-phase cultures in terms of growth curves, DNA content per dish and ability to incorporate 3H-thymidine. This reduction in growth potential is not accompanied by any reduction in chromatin template activity, determined in nuclear "ghost" monolayer, using either the endogenous polymerase or an exogenous bacterial enzyme. Therefore the declining division potential as these cells pass from young to middle passage is unlikely to occur as an expression of alterations in nuclear RNA synthesis. It is, however, possible that the apparently continuous decline in growth potential with age might be caused by different events at various stages of the cells's lifespan.
1898445	Alterations in brain high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolism in first-episode, drug-naive schizophrenics. A pilot study of the dorsal prefrontal cortex by in vivo phosphorus 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	aging	1991-06-??	In this pilot study, membrane phospholipid and high-energy phosphate metabolism were studied in the dorsal prefrontal cortex of 11 drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenic patients and compared with those of 10 healthy control volunteers comparable in age, education, and parental education. The schizophrenic patients had significantly reduced levels of phosphomonoesters and inorganic orthophosphate and significantly increased levels of phosphodiesters and adenosine triphosphate compared with the controls. The levels of phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate did not differ in the two subject groups. The adenosine triphosphate and inorganic orthophosphate findings suggest functional hypoactivity of the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The phosphomonoester and phosphodiester findings are compatible with either premature aging or an exaggeration of normal programmed regressive events occurring in the neural systems sampled.
7700081	Involvement of Fenton reaction products in differentiation induction of K562 human leukemia cells.	aging	1995-03-??	ADP-Fe2+ (or ATP-Fe2+) complex and H2O2, components of the Fenton reaction, were added to K562 cells, then cultured for 96 h. Ara-C-induced differentiation served as a basis for comparison. Cell numbers, viability, benzidine staining, thymidine incorporation, and cell-cycle distribution by means of flow cytometry were determined. The Fenton reagents reduced the growth rate and thymidine incorporation of leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner as regards the added H2O2 (from 0.01 to 1.0 mM), accompanied by an accumulation of hemoglobin in them. Differentiation of the cells was accompanied by considerable changes in total SOD and catalase activities. Ara-C caused an increase of SOD to 366%, and of catalase to 235%, while the complete Fenton reaction resulted in SOD increase to 705% and catalase decrease to 38% of the untreated control cultures. These shifts in enzyme inductions suggest the existence of a higher H2O2 flux in the differentiating cells. The results are consistent with the…
8114517	Reduced CR1 expression on aged human erythrocytes: immuno-electron microscopic and functional analysis.	aging	1993-11-??	Recognition and clearance of aged human erythrocytes (AE) is a complex process involving immune and non-immune reactions. Complement activation on the surface of AE and deposition of the C3b complement component appear to facilitate this process. Complement receptor type 1 (CR1, CD35) expressed on the surface of human erythrocytes binds to C3b molecules and promotes their inactivation by complement factor I. This may protect the erythrocytes from lysis by complement and by phagocytes. It has been previously reported that aging of human erythrocytes is accompanied by a decrease in the number of CR1 molecules expressed on their surface. Results presented here further support this finding with for the first time a presentation of immune-electron microscopic observation. Haemagglutination and binding assays showed that AE express significantly fewer CR1 (CD35) molecules than young erythrocytes (YE). This is associated in AE with reduced CR1-like factor I co-factor activity and increased de…
8921367	Gene-representing cDNA clusters defined by hybridization of 57,419 clones from infant brain libraries with short oligonucleotide probes.	aging	1996-10-01	Diverse biochemical and computational procedures and facilities have been developed to hybridize thousands of DNA clones with short oligonucleotide probes and subsequently to extract valuable genetic information. This technology has been applied to 73,536 cDNA clones from infant brain libraries. By a mutual comparison of 57,419 samples that were successfully scored by 200-320 probes, 19,726 genes have been identified and sorted by their expression levels. The data indicate that an additional 20,000 or more genes may be expressed in the infant brain. Representative clones of the found genes create a valuable resource for complete sequencing and functional studies of many novel genes. These results demonstrate the unique capacity of hybridization technology to identify weakly transcribed genes and to study gene networks involved in organismal development, aging, or tumorigenesis by monitoring the expression of every gene in related tissues, whether known or still undiscovered.
24984955	Cohort Profile: The Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging (MoNNET-HA) study.	aging	2016-02-??	The Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging study was established: (i) to assess the added value in using formal network methods and instruments to measure social capital and its relationship to health; (ii) to determine whether older adults are more vulnerable to the effects of network and neighbourhood environments; and (iii) to examine longitudinally the relationship between social capital and health among adults in Montreal, Canada. The MoNNET-HA cohort consists of men and women aged 25 years and older, residing in the Montreal Metropolitan Area (MMA). Participants were recruited using a random stratified cluster sampling design with oversampling of adults older than 65 years. Initial MoNNET-HA study participants (n = 2707) were recruited for telephone interviews in the summer of 2008. Since 2008, participants were interviewed in the autumn of 2010 and the winter of 2013/2014. Data currently fall into five categories: (i) social network and social capital; (ii) psychosoci…
25098525	Religious Attendance and Physiological Problems in Late Life.	aging	2016-03-??	OBJECTIVES: This study queried linkages of older adults' religious attendance with their physiological health.    METHOD: Data were from the 2005-2006 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, nationally representative of U.S. adults aged 57-85 years. Analyses examined associations of religious attendance with biological states, potential gender variations in these linkages, and attenuation by this factor of health effects of spousal loss.    RESULTS: Religious attendance was negatively associated with a system of physiological issues, consistent with mitigation of multisystemic "weathering." Linkages were relatively uniform with inflammatory and cardiovascular but not metabolic states and were not significantly different for women than men. Effects of spousal loss on the 2 former subsystems were attenuated by regular religious attendance-in combined-gender analysis and among women, but not men.    DISCUSSION: Religious attendance may buffer older adults from physiological probl…
20226253	Regional gray matter volume of dopaminergic system associate with creativity: evidence from voxel-based morphometry.	aging	2010-06-??	Creativity has been essential to the development of human civilization and plays a crucial role in cultural life. However, despite a number of functional imaging studies on creativity, the relationship between regional gray matter morphology and creativity has never been investigated in subcortical regions. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify the gray matter correlates of individual creativity as measured by the divergent thinking test. We found positive correlations between regional gray matter volume and individual creativity in several regions such as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral striata and in an anatomical cluster which included areas such as the substantia nigra, tegmental ventral area and periaqueductal gray. These findings suggest that individual creativity, as measured by the divergent thinking test, is mainly related to the regional gray matter of brain regions known to be associated with the dopaminergic system, congruent with the idea th…
20524193	Fabrication of a biodegradable calcium polyphosphate/polyvinyl-urethane carbonate composite for high load bearing osteosynthesis applications.	aging	2010-07-??	The formation of biodegradable implants for use in osteosynthesis has been a major goal of biomaterials research for the past 2-3 decades. Self-reinforced polylactide systems represent the most significant success of this research to date, however, with elastic constants up to 12-15 GPa at best, they fail to provide the initial stiffness required of devices for stabilizing fractures of major load-bearing bones. Our research has investigated the use of calcium polyphosphate (CPP), an inorganic polymer in combination with polyvinyl-urethane carbonate (PVUC) organic polymers for such applications. Initial studies indicated that composite samples formed as interpenetrating phase composites (IPC) exhibited suitable as-made strength and stiffness, however, they displayed a rapid loss of properties when exposed to in vitro aging. An investigation to determine the mechanism of this accelerated in vitro degradation for the IPCs as well as to identify possible design changes to overcome this dra…
9199187	Generation of active oxygen species from advanced glycation end-products (AGE) under ultraviolet light A (UVA) irradiation.	aging	1997-06-18	To clarify a possible role of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) on photoaging of human skin, the interaction between AGE and ultraviolet A light (UVA) was examined from both a biological and chemical perspective. Human dermal fibroblasts that were exposed to UVA in the presence of AGE bound with bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) exhibited a significant decrease of cell viability as compared to control cells, which were exposed to UVA in the absence of AGE-BSA. Further, UVA-irradiated AGE-BSA reduced nitroblue tetrazolium to its formazan, but the reaction was inhibited by addition of superoxide dismutase in the system. UVA dose-dependent formation of H2O2 in AGE-BSA was also observed. An ESR spin-trapping study revealed the generation of unstable free radicals in AGE-BSA under UVA irradiation. After addition of Fe2+ in the system, an ESR spectrum due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals was observed. On the basis of these results, the authors propose that AGE is an important factor fo…
24523238	Human platelet microRNA-mRNA networks associated with age and gender revealed by integrated plateletomics.	aging	2014-04-17	There is little data considering relationships among human RNA, demographic variables, and primary human cell physiology. The platelet RNA and expression-1 study measured platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid, ADP, protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 activation peptide (PAR1-AP), and PAR4-AP, as well as mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) levels in platelets from 84 white and 70 black healthy subjects. A total of 5911 uniquely mapped mRNAs and 181 miRNAs were commonly expressed and validated in a separate cohort. One hundred twenty-nine mRNAs and 15 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) by age, and targets of these miRNAs were over-represented among these mRNAs. Fifty-four mRNAs and 9 miRNAs were DE by gender. Networks of miRNAs targeting mRNAs, both DE by age and gender, were identified. The inverse relationship in these RNA pairs suggests miRNAs regulate mRNA levels on aging and between genders. A simple, interactive public web tool (www.plateletomics.com) was developed that permits que…
23952680	Sequential injection approach for simultaneous determination of ultratrace plutonium and neptunium in urine with accelerator mass spectrometry.	aging	2013-09-17	An analytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of ultratrace level plutonium (Pu) and neptunium (Np) using iron hydroxide coprecipitation in combination with automated sequential injection extraction chromatography separation and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement. Several experimental parameters affecting the analytical performance were investigated and compared including sample preboiling operation, aging time, amount of coprecipitating reagent, reagent for pH adjustment, sedimentation time, and organic matter decomposition approach. The overall analytical results show that preboiling and aging are important for obtaining high chemical yields for both Pu and Np, which is possibly related to the aggregation and adsorption behavior of organic substances contained in urine. Although the optimal condition for Np and Pu simultaneous determination requires 5-day aging time, an immediate coprecipitation without preboiling and aging could also provide fairly s…
24673641	The evaluation of inflammatory markers in umbilical cord blood.	aging	2014-06-??	We have read with great interest the article by Lausten-Thomsen et al. entitled "Inflammatory Markers in Umbilical Cord Blood from Small-For-Gestational-Age Newborns" in which they report Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in umbilical cord blood from small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and healthy newborns. In this regard, we would like to make some additions to paper in respect to interpretations of biochemical markers. Normal CRP concentration in healthy human serum is usually lower than 10 mg/L, slightly increasing with aging. Acute inflammatory response causes release of IL-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP by the liver. In this article, IL-6 levels reported as elevated but CRP levels have remained in normal range. In this situation, increasing in IL-6 levels should be approached suspiciously. Although decreased TNF-α level was compatible with IL-6 levels, increased IL-6 levels did not cause CRP elevation in …
11952539	Quantitative in situ evaluation of telomeres in fluorescence in situ hybridization-processed sections of cutaneous melanocytic lesions and correlation with telomerase activity.	aging	2002-03-??	BACKGROUND: Telomere length is correlated with cellular ageing and immortalization processes. In some human cancers telomere length measurement has proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value. Results comparable with the traditional terminal restriction fragment length determination by Southern blotting have been obtained in metaphase and interphase cells in some studies by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis; FISH additionally allows for the quantification of telomeres at the cellular level.    OBJECTIVES: In this study, 32 melanocytic lesions were analysed by FISH, aiming at investigating possible telomere differences among various benign and malignant lesions and correlation with telomerase activity (TA) level.    METHODS: FISH was performed on paraffin sections from six common naevi, eight Spitz naevi, 12 melanomas, six melanoma metastases and nine control samples of normal skin. Telomere mean maximum diameter (Feret max), area and number per nuclear area were ca…
28592272	Betaine promotes cell differentiation of human osteoblasts in primary culture.	aging	2017-??-07	BACKGROUND: Betaine (BET), a component of many foods, is an essential osmolyte and a source of methyl groups; it also shows an antioxidant activity. Moreover, BET stimulates muscle differentiation via insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I). The processes of myogenesis and osteogenesis involve common mechanisms with skeletal muscle cells and osteoblasts sharing the same precursor. Therefore, we have hypothesized that BET might be effective on osteoblast cell differentiation.    METHODS: The effect of BET was tested in human osteoblasts (hObs) derived from trabecular bone samples obtained from waste material of orthopedic surgery. Cells were treated with 10 mM BET at 5, 15, 60 min and 3, 6 and 24 h. The possible effects of BET on hObs differentiation were evaluated by real time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Calcium imaging was used to monitor intracellular calcium changes.    RESULTS: Real time PCR results showed that BET stimulated significantly the expression of RUNX…
2830926	The role of calcium in the age-related decline of neutrophil function.	aging	1988-03-??	Upon activation by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), either in the presence of absence of cytochalasin B, neutrophils from old subjects generated significantly less superoxide than did neutrophils from the young. This reduction in activity was associated with a significant decrease in the basal cytosolic calcium concentration and a diminished flux of calcium to the cytosol after activation. At all concentrations of FMLP tested, cytosolic calcium remained significantly lower in neutrophils from the old as compared with the young, whereas permeability to extracellular calcium and efflux of calcium from the cell were also significantly diminished. Pretreatment of the cell with the ionophore ionomycin elevated the cytosolic calcium concentration and significantly improved function in old neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that aging results in alterations in neutrophil calcium homeostasis that may play a role in the age-related decline in neutrophil function.
16702332	Introduction to the 5th Amino Acid Assessment Workshop.	aging	2006-??-??	Amino acids (AAs) may be consumed at intakes above those that could be obtained from the normal diet, to promote health status in certain specific situations (e.g., sports training, aging). In this context, the relevant AAs may be used at high intake levels, which may in turn trigger adverse effects. There is little information on the adverse effects or pathophysiological consequences of excessive intakes of individual amino acids or mixtures. Hence, a series of workshops (named AAAW) are being organized to bring together experts in the fields of amino acid metabolism and nutritional effects, cell and molecular biology, toxicology, and regulatory issues and policy, with the aim of establishing a paradigm for the characterization of risks associated with specific intakes of amino acids by humans. The first 3 workshops covered general aspects concerning AAs (functions, risk characterization, differences in subpopulations, definition of surrogate markers, etc.). The fourth AAAW focused on…
21838914	Associations between dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and arachidonic acid compositions in plasma and erythrocytes in young and elderly Japanese volunteers.	aging	2011-08-13	BACKGROUND: We reported that the compositions of arachidonic acid (ARA) in erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids (PL) in the elderly were lower than those in the young, though the ARA intake was nearly identical.    OBJECTIVE: We further analyzed data in four study groups with different ages and sexes, and determined that the blood ARA levels were affected by the kinds of dietary fatty acids ingested.    METHODS: One hundred and four healthy young and elderly volunteers were recruited. Dietary records together with photographic records from 28 consecutive days were reviewed and the fatty acid composition in plasma lipid fractions and erythrocyte PL was analyzed.    RESULTS: No correlations for ARA between dietary fatty acids and blood lipid fractions were observed. A significant negative correlation between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake and ARA composition in erythrocyte PL was observed. ARA composition in erythrocyte PL was significantly lower in elde…
25910916	In vitro study of the neuropathic potential of the organophosphorus compounds fenamiphos and profenofos: Comparison with mipafox and paraoxon.	aging	2015-08-??	Organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) is a central-peripheral distal axonopathy that develops 8-14 days after poisoning by a neuropathic organophosphorus compound (OP). Several OPs that caused OPIDN were withdrawn from the agricultural market due to induction of serious delayed effects. Therefore, the development of in vitro screenings able to differentiate neuropathic from non-neuropathic OPs is of crucial importance. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the neurotoxic effects of mipafox (neuropathic OP) and paraoxon (non-neuropathic OP) in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, using the inhibition and aging of neuropathy target esterase (NTE), inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), activation of calpain, neurite outgrowth, cytotoxicity and intracellular calcium as indicators. Additionally, the potential of fenamiphos and profenofos to cause acute and/or delayed effects was also evaluated. Mipafox had the lowest IC50 and induced the highest per…
2531913	Pancreatic pseudocyst fluid--a mixture of plasma proteins and pancreatic juice possessing a high proteolytic activity.	aging	1989-09-??	Pancreatic pseudocyst fluid from eight patients was examined biochemically. The fluid was found to be a mixture of plasma proteins and pancreatic juice, possessing a high proteolytic activity against high- as well as low-molecular-weight proteins. The proteolytic activity was found to be trypsin-, kallikrein- and plasmin-like. Gel filtration studies showed proteolytic activity to be present corresponding to alpha-2-macroglobulin-bound proteases and also to free proteases. Quantitative immunochemical levels were about 30-100% of normal plasma levels for alpha-2-macroglobulin, C1 inhibitor, antithrombin III and alpha-2-antiplasmin. However, there was practically no functional inhibitory capacity left in the pseudocyst fluid, except for alpha-1-protease inhibitor, which retained its inhibitory capacity. Neither native kininogen nor complement factor C3 was found: this was probably a result of the proteolytic activity. It is concluded, that a continuing proteolytic activity within the pseu…
6015571	Negro variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (A-) in man.	aging	1967-01-06	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in erythrocytes of the Negro type associated with enzyme deficiency (A(-)) was separated by chromatography on a carboxymethyl-Sephadex column from the electrophoretically indistinguishable Negro variant with normal enzyme activity (A(+)). Quantitative immunologic neutralization tests indicated that the A(-) enzyme had about the same enzymatic and serological activity as the A(+) and the normal (B(+)) enzymes. The enzyme activity of the A(-) variant in young erythrocytes was similar to that in young cells from normal individuals, although the activity of the A(-) variant in unfractionated red cells was 10 to 15 percent of normal. These data indicate that the basic defect in the variant enzyme (A(-)) is a structural mutation which causes more rapid degradation of the enzyme during erythrocyte aging.
24910432	Age-related dysfunction in mechanotransduction impairs differentiation of human mammary epithelial progenitors.	aging	2014-06-26	Dysfunctional progenitor and luminal cells with acquired basal cell properties accumulate during human mammary epithelial aging for reasons not understood. Multipotent progenitors from women aged <30 years were exposed to a physiologically relevant range of matrix elastic modulus (stiffness). Increased stiffness causes a differentiation bias towards myoepithelial cells while reducing production of luminal cells and progenitor maintenance. Lineage representation in progenitors from women >55 years is unaffected by physiological stiffness changes. Efficient activation of Hippo pathway transducers YAP and TAZ is required for the modulus-dependent myoepithelial/basal bias in younger progenitors. In older progenitors, YAP and TAZ are activated only when stressed with extraphysiologically stiff matrices, which bias differentiation towards luminal-like phenotypes. In vivo YAP is primarily active in myoepithelia of younger breasts, but localization and activity increases in luminal cells with …
9137838	Isolation and characterization of isoforms of retinol binding protein by isoelectrofocusing.	aging	1997-04-??	Retinol binding protein prepared from human urine was fractionated by chromatofocusing into four isoforms: two retinol-containing (holo-) and two retinol-free (apo-) species. The pl values of the isoforms ascertained by isoelectrofocusing with an immobiline pH gradient were: holo(I) 4.79-4.77; apo(II) 4.61-4.56; holo(III) 4.63 and apo(IV) 4.46-4.41. In vitro aging experiments with apo(II) under conditions favoring deamidation (37 degrees C, pH 7-10, 3-28 days) resulted in formation of the more acidic apo(IV)-isoform. The aging rate was consistent with pH increase. It appears that the urinary RBP mixture is composed of two apo-holo pairs: a native form with genuine protein structure and an acidic form generated upon aging.
26636271	Examining the Relationships Between Bone Tissue Composition, Compositional Heterogeneity, and Fragility Fracture: A Matched Case-Controlled FTIRI Study.	aging	2016-??-??	Fourier transform infrared imaging (FTIRI) provides information on spatial distribution of the chemical composition of thin tissue specimens at ∼7 µm spatial resolution. This study of 120 age- and bone mineral density (BMD)-matched patients was designed to investigate the association of FTIRI variables, measured in iliac crest biopsies, with fragility fractures at any site. An earlier study of 54 women found hip BMD to be a significant explanatory variable of fracture risk for cortical bone but not for cancellous bone. In the current study, where age and BMD were controlled through matching, no such association was observed, validating the pairing scheme. Our first study of unmatched iliac crest biopsies found increases in collagen maturity (cancellous and cortical bone) and mineral crystal size (cortical bone only) to be a significant explanatory variable of fracture when combined with other covariates. The ratio for collagen maturity has been correlated to the amount of enzymatic col…
16584192	Effect of site-directed mutagenesis of methylglyoxal-modifiable arginine residues on the structure and chaperone function of human alphaA-crystallin.	aging	2006-04-11	We reported previously that chemical modification of human alphaA-crystallin by a metabolic dicarbonyl compound, methylglyoxal (MGO), enhances its chaperone-like function, a phenomenon which we attributed to formation of argpyrimidine at arginine residues (R) 21, 49, and 103. This structural change removes the positive charge on the arginine residues. To explore this mechanism further, we replaced these three R residues with a neutral alanine (A) residue one at a time or in combination and examined the impact on the structure and chaperone function. Measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and near-UV CD spectra revealed alteration of the microenvironment of aromatic amino acid residues in mutant proteins. When compared to wild-type (wt) alphaA-crystallin, the chaperone function of R21A and R103A mutants increased 20% and 18% as measured by the insulin aggregation assay and increased it as much as 39% and 28% when measured by the citrate synthase (CS) aggregation assay. While t…
22121051	Distinctive immunoregulatory effects of adenosine on T cells of older humans.	aging	2012-03-??	A role for adenosine in immunosenescence was investigated in T cells from older (≥65 yr) and younger (24-45 yr) healthy humans. Adenosine concentrations in cultures of activated T cells were significantly higher (P<0.0001) for older (145±47 nM, mean±sd) than younger (58±5.5 nM) subjects. Expression of the activation coreceptor CD28 was suppressed significantly by 0.1 to 1 μM exogenous adenosine, with greater effects of 1 μM (P<0.01) on T cells of younger (mean suppression of 67 and 65% for CD4 and CD8 T cells, respectively) than older (means of 42 and 46%) subjects. T-cell chemotaxis to CCL21 was suppressed significantly by 0.3 and 1 μM exogenous adenosine, with mean maximum decreases of 39 and 49%, respectively, for younger subjects and 28 and 31% for older subjects. Generation of IL-2 and IFN-γ by T cells of younger and older subjects was suppressed substantially only at adenosine levels of 3 μM or higher. Lower baseline expression of CD28 and chemotaxis to CCL21 and S1P for T cells …
25268115	Early life adversity potentiates the effects of later life stress on cumulative physiological dysregulation.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research indicates that early life adversity may heighten stress reactivity and impair mechanisms for adaptive coping, suggesting that experience of stress in early life may also potentiate adults' physiological vulnerability to stress in later life. The study tested this hypothesis by investigating whether the experience of stressful events and circumstances (SEC) in childhood or adolescence amplified the effect of adulthood SEC on physiological dysregulation (allostatic load, AL) in later midlife.    DESIGN: Observational data were used in the present study. Physiological functioning was measured in later midlife (participants' age ranged from 49 to 63 years). Both childhood/adolescence and adulthood SEC were reported retrospectively on the same occasion.    METHODS: Participants were 5309 Danish men and women from Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank (CAMB). SEC included socioeconomic and family factors. The AL index was based on nine cardiovascul…
6973357	Separation and characterization of hexokinase I subtypes from human erythrocytes.	aging	1981-06-15	Hexokinase (ATP: D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) type 1 from human erythrocytes exists in four electrophoretical distinct forms, termed Ia, Ib, Ic and Id in order of their increasing anodal electrophoretic mobility at pH 8.8. We were able to separate type Ia, Ib and Icd on phosphocellulose by using a discontinuous gradient elution. The three chromatographically distinct forms do not differ in their affinity constants for the substrates glucose and MgATP2-. In addition the inhibition by glucose 1,6-diphosphate does not differ significantly for all forms. However, the regulation of these inhibitions by inorganic phosphate is much less for type Ia compared to the other subtypes (P = 0.001). Aging of the red cells is accompanied by a relative increase of the proportion of type Ic and Ia, which is the less regulated form of the enzyme. This shift in electrophoretic and regulatory properties is argued to be due to a post-translational modification of the primary enzyme.
22925630	Spermidine inhibits MMP-2 via modulation of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase in HDFs.	aging	2012-12-??	In recent years, aging has been reported to be regulated by HAT. In this study, the inhibitory effects of spermidine on the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and expression were investigated in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). It was observed that spermidine inhibits MMP-2 activity and expression. In addition, the expression levels of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), phospho-extracellular-signal related kinase (p-ERK), phospho-c-jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) are decreased in the presence of spermidine. In contrast, the expression levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), phospho-p38 (p-p38) are increased by spermidine. In conclusion, our results suggest that spermidine could have a therapeutic potential in inhibition of metastasis through the inhibitory effects on activity and expression of MMP-2 via regulation of HAT and HDAC.
24163162	In vitro evaluation of the effects of human umbilical cord extracts on human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes.	aging	2014-04-??	Skin aging is the result of internal and external factors. So-called photoaging has been identified as the major factor in skin aging. Effects of photoaging include inhibition of fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation as well as collagen and fibronectin expression, while activating expression of collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase-1. Previous studies have shown that extracts or products from human placenta significantly improve skin aging and chronic wound healing. However, there are few studies of umbilical cord extracts. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of umbilical cord extract-derived formulae on three kinds of skin cells including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes. We prepared 20 formulae from intracellular umbilical cord extracts, extracellular umbilical cord extracts, and umbilical cord-derived stem cell extracts, as well as five control formulae. We evaluated the effects of the 25 formulae on fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation, a…
90611	Increased urinary beta 2-microglobulin in cadmium exposure: dose-effect relationship and biological significance of beta 2-microglobulin.	aging	1979-02-??	A study on the general population from both cadmium-polluted and control areas and on cadmium alloy workers indicates that beta 2-MG in urine is very closely correlated with aging, but it indicates an association with cadmium exposure. However, the age factor is stronger than cadmium exposre in both polluted and control areas among persons without clinical proteinuria. On the other hand, cadmium exposure is most likely correlated with beta 2-MG even in nonpolluted areas. Thus it seems that there is no noneffect level of cadmium dose in affecting the elevation of beta 2-MG in urine. beta 2-MG in serum indicated a very close correlation with cadmium in blood among cadmium alloy workers. This may suggest that an increase of beta 2-MG in both blood and urine in an early stage of cadmium exposure is caused by the increased level of beta 2-MG in blood, which may be a result of stimulation due to cadmium, but not necessarily by the clinical dysfunction of reabsorption of beta 2-MG in the rena…
25867977	Multiple functions of gingival and mucoperiosteal fibroblasts in oral wound healing and repair.	aging	2015-06-??	Fibroblasts are cells of mesenchymal origin. They are responsible for the production of most extracellular matrix in connective tissues and are essential for wound healing and repair. In recent years, it has become clear that fibroblasts from different tissues have various distinct traits. Moreover, wounds in the oral cavity heal under very special environmental conditions compared with skin wounds. Here, we reviewed the current literature on the various interconnected functions of gingival and mucoperiosteal fibroblasts during the repair of oral wounds. The MEDLINE database was searched with the following terms: (gingival OR mucoperiosteal) AND fibroblast AND (wound healing OR repair). The data gathered were used to compare oral fibroblasts with fibroblasts from other tissues in terms of their regulation and function during wound healing. Specifically, we sought answers to the following questions: (i) what is the role of oral fibroblasts in the inflammatory response in acute wounds; (…
16191252	Functional brain imaging as a surrogate marker in vascular cognitive impairment.	aging	2003-??-??	Functional brain imaging represents cerebrovascular status, neuronal status, and neuronetwork status, and plays an increasingly important role in the evaluation of vascular cognitive impairment or vascular dementia. In this article, the roles of functional brain imaging are discussed in evaluation of subcortical lesions disrupting cortico-subcortical circuits and in the study of white-matter changes in dementia. Also mentioned is an ongoing clinical trial of extracranial-intracranial artery bypass surgery for hemispheric hemodynamic misery perfusion where single-photon emission tomography is used as a surrogate measure.
7621968	Age-dependent changes in proteoglycan biosynthesis in human intervertebral discs.	aging	1995-??-??	Proteoglycans from annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of human intervertebral disc were investigated by electrophoresis in a composite agarose-polyacrylamide gel and immunohistochemically using various monoclonal antibodies against components of extracellular matrix. There were at least five different populations of proteoglycans in both annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus. Proteoglycans represented by individual electrophoretic bands differed from each other in hydrodynamic size but all of them contained epitopes present in keratan sulphate. Chondroitin sulphate could be detected in populations with molecular weight above 200,000 daltons. We could postulate that the cleavage of proteoglycan chains starts at the C-terminal end. This is supported by the finding that the globular region G2 on the protein core was detected in the same populations as keratan sulphate. We could confirm these results using tissue cultures of nucleus pulposus, inner and external part of annulus fibrosus.…
29224504	Mechanisms of carnosine-induced activation of neuronal cells.	aging	2018-04-??	Carnosine (β-Ala-l-His), an imidazole dipeptide, is known to have many functions. Recently, we demonstrated in a double-blind randomized controlled trial that carnosine is capable of preserving cognitive function in elderly people. In the current study, we assessed the ability of carnosine to activate the brain, and we tried to clarify the molecular mechanisms behind this activation. Our results demonstrate that carnosine permeates the blood brain barrier and activates glial cells within the brain, causing them to secrete neurotrophins, including BDNF and NGF. These results point to a novel mechanism of carnosine-induced neuronal activation. Our results suggest that carnosine should be recognized as a functional food factor that helps achieve anti-brain aging.
11704945	Werner's syndrome (adult progeria): an affected mother and son presenting with resistant psychosis.	aging	????-??-??	Age-related psychotic conditions may be studied by focusing on the unique group of progeroid syndromes. This report will focus on Werner's syndrome, one of the better defined and studied progeroid syndromes. We applied clinical and histophysiological evaluations to two patients, a mother and son, suffering from Werner's syndrome. Both patients presented with resistant psychosis and evidence of impaired cellular repair mechanisms. Psychiatric morbidity in Werner's syndrome is rarely reported. This syndrome can serve as a possible model for aging-associated development of psychosis.
27941391	Mechanobiological implications of articular cartilage crystals.	aging	2017-??-??	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Calcium crystals exist in both pathological and normal articular cartilage. The prevalence of these crystals dramatically increases with age, and crystals are typically found in osteoarthritic cartilage and synovial fluid. Relatively few studies have examined the effects of crystals on cartilage biomechanics or chondrocyte mechanotransduction. The purpose of this review is to describe how crystals could influence cartilage biomechanics and mechanotransduction in osteoarthritis.    RECENT FINDINGS: Crystals are found in both loaded and unloaded regions of articular cartilage. Exogenous crystals, in combination with joint motion, result in substantial joint inflammation. Articular cartilage vesicles promote crystal formation, and these vesicles are found near the periphery of chondrocytes. Crystallographic studies report monoclinic symmetry for synthetic crystals, suggesting that crystals will have a large stiffness compared with the cartilage extracellular matrix, the…
9689202	Changes in reproductive hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin in a group of postmenopausal women measured over 10 years.	aging	1998-??-??	OBJECTIVE: As part of a study on hormones and bone density in older women, we measured a number of steroid and polypeptide hormones at 4- to 6-month intervals in 32 women over a 10-year period.    DESIGN: All women were postmenopausal during this time and all measurements from 12 months after the menopause to the end were used in the analysis. To determine whether there was a significant trend in steroid or polypeptide hormones over the years, the data were analyzed by random coefficient linear regression against number of months since menopause.    RESULTS: There was no significant trend in the concentrations of estrone, estrone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone, and follicle stimulating hormone. There was a significant decline in the concentrations of estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and luteinizing hormone. There was a rise in the levels of androstenedione and testosterone.    CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin …
25136900	Effect of cleansing methods on saliva-contaminated zirconia--an evaluation of resin bond durability.	aging	????-??-??	The aims of this study were to investigate 1) the influence of cleansing methods after saliva contamination and 2) aging conditions (thermocycling and water storage) on zirconia shear bond strength (SBS) with a resin cement. One hundred and eighty zirconia specimens were sandblasted with 50 μm aluminum oxide particles, immersed in saliva for one minute (with the exception of the control group, [C]), and divided into groups according to the cleansing method, as follows: water rinse (W); 37% phosphoric acid gel (PA); cleaning paste (ie, Ivoclean®) containing mainly zirconium oxide (IC); and 70% isopropanol (AL). Scanning electron microscopy was done to qualitatively evaluate the zirconia surface after each cleansing method. For the SBS test, resin cement buttons were bonded to the specimens using a dedicated jig. SBS was evaluated according to standard protocols after 24 hours, 5000 thermal cycles (TC), or 150 days of water storage. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analys…
11708785	Preferential expression of an intact WRN gene in Werner syndrome cell lines in which a normal chromosome 8 has been introduced.	aging	2001-11-23	Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging syndrome caused by mutations in the WRN gene. All mutations of the WRN gene reported thus far are predicted to produce the truncated WRN proteins. The mRNAs that contain chain-termination mutations are supposed to be unstable due to degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the present study, we investigated the expressions of intact and nonsense-mutated WRN genes in Werner syndrome cell lines in which a normal chromosome 8 had been introduced by microcell fusion. We demonstrate here that the expression of the mutated WRN gene that produces nonsense mRNAs remains at low levels, resulting in the preferential expression of the intact WRN gene in the WS microcell hybrids. This result supports the idea that imperfect messages containing premature termination codons are eliminated by the RNA surveillance system, suggesting the significance of the NMD mechanism in the etiology of Werner syndrome.
3518721	Reactivation of nerve agent inhibited human acetylcholinesterases by HI-6 and obidoxime.	aging	1986-05-01	Acetylcholinesterase was purified from human caudate nucleus and skeletal muscle. The enzyme preparations were used to study aging and reactivation by HI-6 and obidoxime after inhibition by soman and its isomers. HI-6 was found to be the most potent reactivator. For both enzyme preparations a higher reactivatability and a higher rate of aging were observed after inhibition by C+-soman than after inhibition by C(-)-soman. Aging was retarded by propidium diiodide. Reactivation by the two oximes was also studied after inhibition by tabun, sarin and VX. Tissue homogenates were used for this part of the work. Our conclusion is that HI-6 is superior to obidoxime for human acetylcholinesterases inhibited by soman and sarin, while obidoxime is better towards tabun-inhibited enzyme.
3422412	Absence of three secreted proteins and presence of a 57-kDa protein related to irreversible arrest of cell growth.	aging	1988-01-??	Two subsets of proteins from the conditioned medium of normal human diploid fibroblasts were detected by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis; the presence of these subset is related to the nonproliferative state of in vitro aged cells. One subset consists of three proteins (molecular mass from 80 to 87 kDa) secreted by replicating cells in sparse cultures, as well as by quiescent cells in confluent or serum-starved cultures of young fibroblasts. These proteins disappear from the medium when cultures reach the state of senescence. The other subset consists of a single protein of 57 kDa, detected only in conditioned medium of senescent fibroblast cultures. The results suggest that when human fibroblasts reach senescence, they secrete the 57-kDa protein and concomitantly stop secreting the other three proteins normally found in the culture medium of young fibroblasts. Therefore, the alternative secretion of these protein subsets could specifically signify irreversible arr…
27821539	Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity: Role of the Ang II/AT1 Receptor/NADPH Oxidase-Mediated Activation of MAPKs and PI3-Kinase Pathways.	aging	2017-01-17	BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.    METHODS: Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.    RESULTS: Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associat…
24641605	Comparative study of various growth factors and cytokines on type I collagen and hyaluronan production in human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2014-03-??	BACKGROUND: Dermal fibroblast is a primary cell type responsible for synthesis and remodeling of extracellular matrix in human skin. Type I collagen and hyaluronan are main components that have roles in skin fibrosis, wound healing, tissue remodeling as well as skin aging. Several studies have reported cytokine-dependent changes in collagen expression or hyaluronan production; however, the cytokines' effect was controversial in human dermal fibroblasts.    AIMS: To clarify the role of various growth factors, cytokines or chemokines on the production of interstitial type I collagen and hyaluronan in dermal fibroblasts.    METHODS: We confirmed the presence of various corresponding receptors and assessed the effects of 33 human recombinants on the production of type I collagen and hyaluronan using the assay system in dermal fibroblasts.    RESULTS: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, PDGF-BB, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, MCP-1, IP-10, interleu…
12583598	Hormones and human trophoblast differentiation: a review.	aging	2002-10-??	In the human, fetal cytotrophoblastic cells play a key role in the implantation process and in placental development. With the progression of placentation, two pathways of differentiation lead to the formation of two distinct phenotypes. In the villous trophoblast (fusion phenotype), the trophblast differentiates from the fusion of mononuclear cytotrophoblastic cells into a syncytium, the syncytiotrophoblast. Bathing the maternal blood, the syncytiotrophoblast is involved in maternal-fetal exchanges and in placental endocrine functions. In the extravillous trophoblast (proliferative/invasive phenotype), the cytotrophoblastic cells proliferate and migrate into the decidua, remodeling the pregnant endometrium and its vasculature. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the key step of villous differentiation-the cell-cell fusion of the cytotrophoblastic cells--and on the invasion process of extravillous trophoblast. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the genetic differentiat…
22275547	An exoskeleton using controlled energy storage and release to aid ankle propulsion.	aging	2011-??-??	Symmetric ankle propulsion is the cornerstone of efficient human walking. The ankle plantar flexors provide the majority of the mechanical work for the step-to-step transition and much of this work is delivered via elastic recoil from the Achilles' tendon - making it highly efficient. Even though the plantar flexors play a central role in propulsion, body-weight support and swing initiation during walking, very few assistive devices have focused on aiding ankle plantarflexion. Our goal was to develop a portable ankle exoskeleton taking inspiration from the passive elastic mechanisms at play in the human triceps surae-Achilles' tendon complex during walking. The challenge was to use parallel springs to provide ankle joint mechanical assistance during stance phase but allow free ankle rotation during swing phase. To do this we developed a novel `smart-clutch' that can engage and disengage a parallel spring based only on ankle kinematic state. The system is purely passive - containing no …
26205050	Cell-type specific penetrating peptides: therapeutic promises and challenges.	aging	2015-07-20	Cell penetrating peptides (CPP), also known as protein transduction domains (PTD), are small peptides able to carry peptides, proteins, nucleic acid, and nanoparticles, including viral particles, across the cellular membranes into cells, resulting in internalization of the intact cargo. In general, CPPs can be broadly classified into tissue-specific and non-tissue specific peptides, with the latter further sub-divided into three types: (1) cationic peptides of 6-12 amino acids in length comprised predominantly of arginine, lysine and/or ornithine residues; (2) hydrophobic peptides such as leader sequences of secreted growth factors or cytokines; and (3) amphipathic peptides obtained by linking hydrophobic peptides to nuclear localizing signals. Tissue-specific peptides are usually identified by screening of large peptide phage display libraries. These transduction peptides have the potential for a myriad of diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications, ranging from delivery of fluore…
23897466	Structures of human sirtuin 3 complexes with ADP-ribose and with carba-NAD+ and SRT1720: binding details and inhibition mechanism.	aging	2013-08-??	Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate metabolism and aging processes and are considered to be attractive therapeutic targets. Most available sirtuin modulators are little understood mechanistically, hindering their improvement. SRT1720 was initially described as an activator of human Sirt1, but it also potently inhibits human Sirt3. Here, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition of Sirt3 by SRT1720 is described. A crystal structure of Sirt3 in complex with SRT1720 and an NAD(+) analogue reveals that the compound partially occupies the acetyl-Lys binding site, thus explaining the reported competition with the peptide substrate. The compound packs against a hydrophobic protein patch and binds with its opposite surface to the NAD(+)  nicotinamide, resulting in an exceptionally tight sandwich-like interaction. The observed arrangement rationalizes the uncompetitive inhibition with NAD(+), and binding measurements confirm that the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(+) su…
12403460	Role of xanthurenic acid 8-O-beta-D-glucoside, a novel fluorophore that accumulates in the brunescent human eye lens.	aging	2002-09-??	We have been able to identify a blue fluorophore from the low-molecular weight soluble fraction of human adult nondiabetic brunescent cataract lenses as xanthurenic acid 8-O-beta-D-glucoside (XA8OG) (excitation = 338 nm and emission = 440 nm). To determine the role of this fluorophore in the lens, we have examined its photophysical and photodynamic properties. We found XA8OG to have a fluorescence quantum yield (phi) of 0.22 and a major emission lifetime of 12 ns. We found it to be a UVA-region sensitizer, capable of efficiently generating singlet oxygen species but little of superoxide. We also demonstrated that XA8OG oxidizes proteins when irradiated with UVA light, causing photodynamic covalent chemical damage to proteins. Its accumulation in the aging human lens (and the attendant decrease of its precursor O-beta-D-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine) can, thus, add to the oxidative burden on the system. XA8OG, thus, appears to be an endogenous chromophore in the lens, which can act a…
19478560	Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK and PI-3K converges on the mTOR/S6 pathway to decelerate cellular senescence.	aging	2009-06-15	Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevents cellular senescence. Here we investigated the effects of MEK and PI-3K on cellular senescence. Unlike LY294002 (PI-3K inhibitor), both U0126 and PD98059 (MEK inhibitors) did not significantly decrease beta-Gal staining in aging human fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells. However, using a sensitive, functional method, we identified that not only LY294002 but also U0126 prevented irreversible loss of proliferative potential associated with cellular senescence. At concentrations that blocked S6 phosphorylation, rapamycin, U0126 and LY294002 equally prevented senescence. Furthermore, there was no additive effect by combining of rapamycin with either U0126 or LY294002. Taken together this suggests that (a) simultaneous activation of PI-3K and MEK is required to ensure cellular senescence and (b) U0126 and LY294002 suppress senescence via the rapamycin-sensitive pathway.
9331276	Modulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression in retinas with age-related macular degeneration.	aging	1997-09-??	PURPOSE: To investigate antigenic and morphologic features of microglial and vascular elements in the neural retina associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) compared with those features in age-matched normal and young adult retinas.    METHODS: Adult eyes (n = 97) were classified histopathologically into normal and ARMD-associated groups. Peroxidase imunohistochemical examination of retinal flatmounts was used to visualize major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) immunoreactivity; the intensity and distribution of labeling were quantified by image analysis. In histochemical investigation, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and glial fibrillary acidic protein or MHC-II double labeling were used to detect vascular changes in some preparations.    RESULTS: An increase in the proportion of the retina (percentage of total area) expressing MHC-II immunoreactivity was observed in age-matched retinas compared with that seen in normal retinas…
30507927	Raman and infrared spectroscopy reveal that proliferating and quiescent human fibroblast cells age by biochemically similar but not identical processes.	aging	2018-??-??	Dermal fibroblast cells can adopt different cell states such as proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis or senescence, in order to ensure tissue homeostasis. Proliferating (dividing) cells pass through the phases of the cell cycle, while quiescent and senescent cells exist in a non-proliferating cell cycle-arrested state. However, the reversible quiescence state is in contrast to the irreversible senescence state. Long-term quiescent cells transit into senescence indicating that cells age also when not passing through the cell cycle. Here, by label-free in vitro vibrational spectroscopy, we studied the biomolecular composition of quiescent dermal fibroblast cells and compared them with those of proliferating and senescent cells. Spectra were examined by multivariate statistical analysis using a PLS-LDA classification model, revealing differences in the biomolecular composition between the cell states mainly associated with protein alterations (variations in the side chain residues of amin…
7510914	Undetectable prostate-specific antigen in aging men.	aging	1994-03-??	Undetectable prostate-specific antigen was found in three aging men despite the absence of any prostatic surgery or exogenous hormonal deprivation. Clinical and elementary hormonal workup revealed the presence of secondary hypogonadism. This finding confirms the hormonal dependency of this prostatic marker and may, in some cases, explain the discrepancy between prostatic volume and the value of serum prostate-specific antigen.
18525122	Androgen-forming stem Leydig cells: identification, function and therapeutic potential.	aging	2008-??-??	Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in the male, and differentiation of Leydig cells in the testes is one of the primary events in the development of the male body and fertility. Stem Leydig cells (SLCs) exist in the testis throughout postnatal life, but a lack of cell surface markers previously hindered attempts to obtain purified SLC fractions. Once isolated, the properties of SLCs provide interesting clues for the ontogeny of these cells within the embryo. Moreover, the clinical potential of SLCs might be used to reverse age-related declines in testosterone levels in aging men, and stimulate reproductive function in hypogonadal males. This review focuses on the source, identification and outlook for therapeutic applications of SLCs. Separate pools of SLCs may give rise to fetal and adult generations of Leydig cell, which may account for their observed functional differences. These differences should in turn be taken into account when assessing the consequences of env…
23240957	Analysis of nerve supply pattern in human lymphatic vessels of young and old men.	aging	2012-12-??	BACKGROUND: The present work deals with innervation patterns along collector lymphatic vessels from cervical, mesenteric, and femoral regions, and lymph capillaries in young and elderly subjects.    METHODS AND RESULTS: Morphological and morphometric analysis of nerve fibers along lymph vessels was performed by immunohistochemistry for PGP 9.5, NPY, TH, ChAT, VIP, SP, and dopamine. Nerves containing NPY and TH were frequent, whereas immunoreactivity for ChAT and VIP were few. SP-positive fibers were widely distributed in the medial and endothelial layers. Dopamine neurotransmitters were observed in a few short nerve fibers. A more diffuse presence of nerve fibers in mesenteric and femoral lymph vessels, compared to cervical ones, was detected. In lymph capillary vessels, a few nerve fibers positive for neuropeptides and neurotransmitters were detected, whereas no dopamine and VIP immunoreactive fibers were detected. A wide reduction of all specific nerve fibers analyzed was detected in…
28521620	Depression, Inflammation, and Physiological Risk in Late Life: A National Longitudinal Study.	aging	2017-??-??	This nationally representative study queried effects of community dwelling older adults' depression and inflammation at baseline on over-time changes in surrogate markers of their cardiometabolic risk. Data were from the 2005-2006 and 2010-2011 waves of the U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Inflammation was indicated by C-reactive protein and depression by the CES-D scale. Cardiometabolic markers included hemoglobin A1c and systolic BP. Lagged dependent variable models were used to examine effects. In none of the models did Wave 1 depression predict residual change in cardiometabolic states (i.e., Wave 2 values net of Wave 1). In contrast, men's baseline C-reactive protein predicted their Wave 2 hemoglobin A1c (Coeff. = 0.02, p < .05) as well as their systolic BP (Coeff. = 3.22, p < .05). No such effects were found among women. Contrary to a growing clinical literature, depression may not increase cardiometabolic risk among older adults on average. Moderators that m…
15675889	The role of dimethylaminoethanol in cosmetic dermatology.	aging	2005-??-??	Skincare formulations for the improvement of aging skin are increasingly important consumer products. Here, we review available data on one such agent - 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) or deanol - that has recently been evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial. DMAE is an analog of the B vitamin choline and is a precursor of acetylcholine. Although the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter is well known, growing evidence points to acetylcholine as a ubiquitous cytokine-like molecule that regulates basic cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, locomotion, and secretion in a paracrine and autocrine fashion. Indeed, this modulatory role may contribute to the cutaneous activity of DMAE. In a randomized clinical study, 3% DMAE facial gel applied daily for 16 weeks has been shown to be safe and efficacious (p < 0.05) in the mitigation of forehead lines and periorbital fine wrinkles, and in improving lip shape and fullness and the overall appearance of aging skin. These …
25810366	Cochlear efferents in developing adult and pathological conditions.	aging	2015-07-??	Cochlear activity is regulated by the olivo-cochlear bundle, which originates from the brainstem and projects onto the hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Two efferent components can be distinguished: the medial and lateral olivo-cochlear efferent originating from the medial, and the lateral nuclei of the superior olivary complex. The input of the efferent systems on hair cells occurs during development and persists in the adult cochlea. Recent studies have shown that the efferent innervations are required to set the activity pattern in developing hair cells and auditory nerve fibers and to protect the synaptic structures in adult cochlea. In addition, efferent innervations undergo plasticity during pathological conditions such as noise-trauma or aging. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying the control of the hair cells and afferent fibers excitability by efferent neurons and their putative role in developing adult and pathological conditions.
23006486	Does human leukocyte elastase degrade intact skin elastin?	aging	2012-11-??	This study aimed to investigate the susceptibility of intact fibrillar human elastin to human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. Elastin is a vital protein of the extracellular matrix of vertebrates, and provides exceptional properties including elasticity and tensile strength to many tissues and organs, including the aorta, lung, cartilage, elastic ligaments and skin, and is thus critical for their long-term function. Mature elastin is an insoluble and extremely durable protein that undergoes very little turnover, but sustained exposure to proteases may lead to irreversible and severe damage, and thus to functional loss of the elastic fiber network. Hence, it is a key issue to understand which enzymes actually initiate elastolysis under certain pathological conditions or during intrinsic aging. In this paper, we provide a complete workflow for isolation of pure and intact elastin from very small tissue samples to test enzymes for their elastolytic potential. This workflow was applied…
17460698	Prevalence of major depressive disorder in self-referred patients in a late onset hypogonadism clinic.	aging	????-??-??	The goal was to clarify the rate of major depressive disorder (MDD) in self-referred patients who visited our late onset hypogonadism (LOH) clinic and the importance of screening of MDD in LOH clinic. Two hundred consecutive self-referred patients who visited our LOH clinic were evaluated. MDD was diagnosed using, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) questionnaire. Scores of the Aging Males Symptom (AMS) scale were compared between the MDD and non-MDD groups with and without low testosterone values. Forty-two percent of all patients were categorized into the MDD group. Only 4% of the patients were considered to be LOH. The MDD group had significantly higher scores on the AMS scale than the LOH and non-MDD with normal testosterone groups. In conclusion, significant numbers of undiagnosed MDD patients visited the LOH clinic. Screening for MDD is an essential step in the LOH outpatient clinic.
23921835	Enhanced NO signaling in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: short-term pain, long-term gain?	aging	2013-12-??	PURPOSE: Little information is available concerning the mechanism(s) underlying Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), other than evidence of associated catecholamine secretion. Given the known effects of catecholamines on endothelial function, we tested the hypothesis that TTC might also be associated with impairment of nitric oxide (NO) signaling. We now report an evaluation of NO signaling in TTC patients (vs. aged-matched controls) in relation to (a) severity of the acute attack and (b) rate of recovery.    METHODS: In 56 patients with TTC, we utilized (1) platelet responsiveness to NO and (2) plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) as indices of integrity of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Additionally, endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) counts, which are partially NO-dependent, were evaluated. These parameters were measured at the time of diagnosis and 3 months thereafter, and compared with an aging female cohort (n = 81).    RESULTS: The data suggested tha…
20215438	Telomeric protein TRF2 protects Holliday junctions with telomeric arms from displacement by the Werner syndrome helicase.	aging	2010-07-??	WRN protein loss causes Werner syndrome (WS), which is characterized by premature aging as well as genomic and telomeric instability. WRN prevents telomere loss, but the telomeric protein complex must regulate WRN activities to prevent aberrant telomere processing. Telomere-binding TRF2 protein inhibits telomere t-loop deletion by blocking Holliday junction (HJ) resolvase cleavage activity, but whether TRF2 also modulates HJ displacement at t-loops is unknown. In this study, we used multiplex fluorophore imaging to track the fate of individual strands of HJ substrates. We report the novel finding that TRF2 inhibits WRN helicase strand displacement of HJs with telomeric repeats in duplex arms, but unwinding of HJs with a telomeric center or lacking telomeric sequence is unaffected. These data, together with results using TRF2 fragments and TRF2 HJ binding assays, indicate that both the TRF2 B- and Myb domains are required to inhibit WRN HJ activity. We propose a novel model whereby simu…
3955236	Partial spectrin deficiency in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.	aging	1986-04-??	Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) is a severe hemolytic anemia in which an instability of the red cell membrane skeleton has been correlated with structural and functional defects of spectrin. We now report that 13 unrelated HPP subjects have approximately 30% less spectrin than normal as evidenced by a decreased spectrin/band 3 ratio. We also examine the role of spectrin degradation as an underlying cause of this partial spectrin deficiency. Our studies demonstrate that the reduced spectrin content of HPP red cells remains constant during in vivo aging of the cells in the peripheral blood, as well as during in vitro incubation. Furthermore, immunoblotting experiments using an affinity-purified antispectrin antibody indicate that there is no loss of spectrin during membrane preparation and also that neither whole HPP red cells nor ghosts nor cytosol contains any abnormal spectrin degradation products. These data suggest that spectrin is not degraded and that it is stable on the membr…
30208911	Sex-specific associations between telomere length and candidate miRNA expression in placenta.	aging	2018-??-12	BACKGROUND: In the early-life environment, proper development of the placenta is essential for both fetal and maternal health. Telomere length at birth has been related to life expectancy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as potential epigenetic determinants of telomere length at birth have not been identified. In this study, we investigate whether placental miRNA expression is associated with placental telomere length at birth.    METHODS: We measured the expression of seven candidate miRNAs (miR-16-5p, -20a-5p, -21-5p, -34a-5p, 146a-5p, -210-3p and -222-3p) in placental tissue at birth in 203 mother-newborn (51.7% girls) pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We selected miRNAs known to be involved in crucial cellular processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular senescence related to aging. Placental miRNA expression and relative average placental telomere length were measured using RT-qPCR.    RESULTS: Both before and after adjustment for potential covariates including newborn's et…
29237928	Correlations between Mitofusin 2 Expression in Fibroblasts and Pelvic Organ Prolapse: An <i>In vitro</i> Study.	aging	2017-12-20	BACKGROUND: Both Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are related to aging. The aim of the present study was to investigate the variations of Mfn2 expression in the uterosacral ligaments of patients with and/or without POP and their correlations with the expression of procollagen.    METHODS: Fibroblasts were cultured using tissue specimens that were harvested from the uterosacral ligaments of POP and non-POP (NPOP) patients (n = 10 for each group) from September 2016 to December 2016. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to compare the differences in cell proliferation between the two groups. Relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting assays were employed to assess the differences in the mRNA and protein expression levels of Mfn2 and procollagen 1A1/1A2/3A1 between the two groups. The changes in procollagen expression were assessed following the downregulation of Mfn2 in the POP group using RNAi. The data were ass…
12799129	Secular trends in leisure-time physical activity in men and women across four decades.	aging	2003-07-??	BACKGROUND: We examined secular trends in leisure-time physical activities (LTPA) in health-conscious men (n = 1359) from 1958 to 1998 and in women (n = 839) from 1978 to 1998, who were participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).    METHODS: LTPA was the self-reported time spent performing 97 activities, and was converted to metabolic equivalent of oxygen uptake (MET) minutes per day. Evaluations of LTPA were averaged for each decade. The prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle in each decade was assessed based on compliance with widely publicized recommendations for participation in physical activity. All analyses were adjusted for age, education, and race differences across decades.    RESULTS: Median high-intensity LTPA, defined as activities >/=6 METs, increased from 30 to 80 MET min/day from the 1960s to the 1990s for men (P < 0.01) but did not change between the 1970s and the 1990s in women. Moderate-intensity LTPA, defined as 4-5.9 METs, did not change signific…
3022382	Diminished response of Werner's syndrome fibroblasts to growth factors PDGF and FGF.	aging	1986-12-05	Patients with Werner's syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, undergo an accelerated aging process that leads to premature death. Fibroblasts from such patients typically grow poorly in culture. Here it is shown that fibroblasts from a patient with Werner's syndrome have a markedly attenuated mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In contrast, they have a full mitogenic response to fetal bovine serum. Both PDGF binding and receptor numbers per cell are unaltered. The Werner's syndrome cells express high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro. Although PDGF enhances collagenase expression through increased levels of hybridizable collagenase messenger RNA in normal skin fibroblasts, no induction of collagenase occurs in the Werner's syndrome fibroblasts. Moreover, the failure to respond to this agonist effect of PDGF is not restored by fetal bovine serum. The data suggest that failure of one or more PDGF-mediated pathways …
1116300	Effect of carbon cup aging on plasma zinc determination by flameless atomic adosorption spectrometry.	aging	1975-04-??	Determination of zinc in blood plasma by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry is discussed, with particular reference to the protocol required for the successful use of the Varian-Techtron Carbon Rod Atomizer.  Cup aging is shown to be an important factor in limiting the precision of this analytical technique and ways of minimizing the problem are described.  Matrix problems have also been encountered, which precluded the use of aqueous standard curves and the method of standard additions.  We propose the use of plasma in preparing standard curves, the values for which are corrected for inherent plasma zinc, as a possible solution to the problem.
7432172	Dynamic aspects of whole body glycine metabolism: influence of protein intake in young adult and elderly males.	aging	1980-10-??	The influence of adult age and adequacy of dietary protein intake on whole body glycine metabolism was studied in human subjects. Five healthy young adult males (19-25 yr) and six elderly males (64-78 yr) were given an adequate-protein diet (1.5 g protein/kg/day) for 7 days and a low-protein diet (0.4 g protein/kg/day) for 14 days. At the end of each dietary period, whole body glycine flux and rates of glycine synthesis were estimated with the use of a continuous 60 hr oral administration of 15N-glycine and determination of 15N enrichment of plasma glycine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. Mean whole body glycine flux and the rate of endogenous glycine synthesis were 458 and 351 micromole/kg body weight/hr, respectively, for young adults receiving the diet adequate in protein; similar values were obtained in the elderly group. Feeding the diet low in protein resulted in an extensive and significant reduction in both parameters in young adults and als…
17130689	Plasma selenium over time and cognitive decline in the elderly.	aging	2007-01-??	BACKGROUND: Because brain oxidative stress is a cause of cognitive impairment, selenium, which is an antioxidant, may protect against cognitive decline. The aim of the study was to examine whether declining selenium levels over time are associated with cognitive decline in a cohort of community-dwelling French elderly.    METHODS: During 1991-1993, 1389 subjects (age 60-71 years) were recruited into a 9-year longitudinal study with 6 waves of follow-up. Cognitive functions were evaluated by neuropsychologic tests. To take into account the entire set of cognitive measurements and the within-subject correlations between measures, we analyzed mixed linear and logistic models to study associations between selenium change and cognitive decline.    RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounders, cognitive decline was associated with decreases of plasma selenium over time. Among subjects who had a decrease in their plasma selenium levels, the greater the decrease in plasma selenium, the…
12884479	Iron, folate and vitamins B12 &amp; C dietary intake of an elderly institutionalized population in León, Spain.	aging	????-??-??	Aging is associated with increased risk of developing anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the daily intake of micronutrient whose deficient in diet could cause anaemia (iron, folic acid, vitamin B12) and vitamin C to establish the prevalence of anaemia in a group of institutionalized of 124 elderly subjects residing in five nursing homes in León (Spain). A precise weighing method was used to conduct the control of food intake covering seven days. Energy, alcohol, iron, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin C intake were obtained. Weight, and Height also were measured. Serum iron, serum ferritin, haemoglobin and hematocrit were also measured. Average daily iron intake was higher than the 10 mg recommended by the National Academy of Science although significantly higher (p < 0.05) in males (17.0 +/- 7.4 mg) than in females (11.8 +/- 1.5 mg). Moreover, vitamin C intake in all subjects is high (118.8 +/- 43.7 mg) and higher than Spanish RDA (198%). …
2422304	Growth and function of the placenta--with special reference to various enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of steroids in the human placenta.	aging	1986-03-??	To study the function of the placenta from the viewpoint of placental aging, we measured the activity of various enzymes, sulfatase, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase + isomerase (3 beta-HSD) and aromatizing enzyme, which are involved in the synthesis of estrogen in the placenta, as well as placental RNA and DNA levels during gestation. Our results are as follow; Enzymes involved in estrogen synthesis in human placental villi. Sulfatase activity (n mole/flask/10 min) in each trimester was not significantly different (4.10 +/- 0.10 in the first, 3.40 +/- 0.49 in the second and 4.33 +/- 0.67 in the third). 3 beta-HSD activity (n mole/flask/10 min) in each trimester was not significantly different (2.57 +/- 0.55 in the first, 2.70 +/- 0.30 in the second and 2.90 +/- 0.53 in the third). Aromatizing enzyme activity (n mole/flask/30 min) in cytosome fraction in each trimester was not significantly different (1.80 +/- 0.28 in the first, 1.60 +/- 0.28 in the second and 2.40 +/- 0.28 in the t…
16706661	Variations of humans' natural death rate and the radiocarbon aging mechanism.	aging	2006-??-??	The historical dynamics of the natural death rate have been studied for the populations of 48 European countries from 1970 to 2002, as well as of 191 countries worldwide for 1999, 2000, and 2001. The variations of natural death rate parameters appear to obey the common law in practically all the populations of the planet, and this law follows from the radiocarbon mechanism of aging. The results allow one to imagine the existence of the connection between a person's natural death probability and his or her environmental conditions, brought about by the fact that the environment determines the change of 14C concentration in an organism. Experimental confirmation of such a hypothesis has been considered. As a primary step, it implies the choice of a basic risk factor determining the natural death rate of this or that biologic object, then a comparison of the intensity of the chosen risk factor with radiocarbon content in the whole organism as well as its separate structures.
23760056	Vitamin D and the athlete: risks, recommendations, and benefits.	aging	2013-05-28	Vitamin D is well known for its role in calcium regulation and bone health, but emerging literature tells of vitamin D's central role in other vital body processes, such as: signaling gene response, protein synthesis, hormone synthesis, immune response, plus, cell turnover and regeneration. The discovery of the vitamin D receptor within the muscle suggested a significant role for vitamin D in muscle tissue function. This discovery led researchers to question the impact that vitamin D deficiency could have on athletic performance and injury. With over 77% of the general population considered vitamin D insufficient, it's likely that many athletes fall into the same category. Research has suggested vitamin D to have a significant effect on muscle weakness, pain, balance, and fractures in the aging population; still, the athletic population is yet to be fully examined. There are few studies to date that have examined the relationship between vitamin D status and performance, therefore, thi…
17188915	Red blood cell senescence and neocytolysis in humans after high altitude acclimatization.	aging	????-??-??	A selective lysis of relatively young erythrocytes (neocytolysis), together with a decrease of erythropoietin (EPO) production, has been described in polycythemic, high altitude acclimatized climbers, after descent to sea level, and in astronauts, soon after exposure to weightlessness (Alfrey CP, Rice L, Udden MM, Driscoll TB. Neocytolysis may represent the physiological down-regulation of red-cell mass. Lancet 349 (1997) 1389-90). To study neocytolysis, we analysed blood samples drawn from 4 mountain climbers at sea level before and after 53 days of high altitude acclimatization (> or = 4500 m). After a 6-day descent to sea level, erythropoietin (EPO) plasma levels were lower than before high altitude acclimatization (mean values: 2.5+/-3.3 versus 10+/-4.5 mIU/ml, p < 0.05). Red blood cell (RBC) populations were separated into low, middle and high density subsets, which, by physical and phenotypical criteria, were characterized as young, middle-aged and old. RBC membrane molecules CD5…
8982102	Age-dependent changes in the expression of dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	aging	1996-12-??	The pharmacological profile and the density of dopamine D3 and D5 receptor subtypes expressed by human peripheral blood lymphocytes of subjects of different ages (ranging from 20 to 75 years) were assessed using radioligand binding techniques. Dopamine D3 receptor was assayed with [3H]7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetraline ([3H]7-OH-DPAT) as a ligand. Dopamine D5 receptor was assayed using [3HIR]-(+)-(-chloro-2,3,4,5, tetrahydro-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin-al-hemimaleate) ([3H]SCH 23390) as a ligand. The affinity and the pharmacological profile of [3H]7-OH-DPAT and [3H]SCH 23390 at dopamine D3 and D5 receptor, respectively, were similar in subjects of different ages. The density of dopamine D3 receptor binding sites was slightly decreased in subjects of 30-39 years in comparison with younger individuals. A remarkable loss of dopamine D3 receptor was then found between 40 and 49 years of age in comparison with younger subjects. A further slight decrease was noticeable between 50 and 59…
1666816	Clinical utility of fractionating erythrocytes into "Percoll" density gradients.	aging	1991-??-??	Two rapid methods for fractionating the RBC into five or nine layers of increasing density are reported. These procedures have been used to monitor the decline of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) activity during the process of red cell aging in normal subjects and in beta-thal carriers, to study transfused patients with G6PD and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency and to test the effects of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) encapsulation on RBC subpopulations.
2670576	Psychiatric implications of altered limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity.	aging	1989-??-??	Hormones of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (LHPA) system are much involved in central nervous system regulation. The major LHPA neuropeptides, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin (ACTH) do not only coordinate the neuroendocrine response to stress, but also induce behavioral adaptation. Transcription and post-translational processing of these neuropeptides is regulated by corticosteroids secreted from the adrenal cortex after stimulation by ACTH and other proopiomelanocortin derived peptides. These steroids play a key role as regulators of cell development, homeostatic maintenance and adaptation to environmental challenges. They execute vitally important actions through genomic effects resulting in altered gene expression and nongenomic effects leading to altered neuronal excitability. Since excessive secretory activity of this particular neuroendocrine system is part of an acute stress response or depressive symptom pattern, ther…
22032943	The Yale experience in first advancing fMRI.	aging	2012-08-15	In 1992 during a period of only a few months functional brain mapping by MRI became an international research field. This paper gives background to the first studies performed at Yale University during April 1992 which examined the temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in the human visual cortex. For the first time it was shown that even brief visual stimuli could produce a BOLD response which was delayed (due to the hemodynamic response) and was detected by imaging some seconds (on average 1.5s) after the stimuli was over. This observation was the first event-related scanning study by fMRI.
14584050	Non-hematopoietic human bone marrow contains long-lasting, pluripotential mesenchymal stem cells.	aging	2004-01-??	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are considered as potential agents for reconstructive and gene-targeting therapies since they differentiate into various cell-lineages, exhibit an extended survival once injected into a host, and can easily be transfected with engineered DNA. MSC are essentially isolated from hematopoietic bone marrow (BM), a process that is rather invasive and may raise ethical concerns. In an attempt to find an alternative source, we evaluated whether non-hematopoietic (nh)BM recovered from femoral heads of patients undergoing hip arthroplasty contained MSC. Ex vivo, 99% of nhBM cells were CD45(+) leukocytes. After culture, leukocytes were replaced by a homogeneous layer of adherent CD45(-) CD14(-) CD34(-) CD11b(-) CD90(+) HLA-ABC(+) cells. Culture doubling time (mean = 4 days, range 1.6-6.7 days) was not correlated with patient age (27-81 years, n = 16). Amplified cultures supported long-term hematopoiesis, and could be differentiated in vitro into adipocytes and chondro…
19190732	Deamidation alters interactions of beta-crystallins in hetero-oligomers.	aging	2009-??-??	PURPOSE: Cataracts are a major cause of blindness worldwide. A potential mechanism for loss of visual acuity may be due to light scattering from disruption of normal protein-protein interactions. During aging, the lens accumulates extensively deamidated crystallins. We have previously reported that deamidation in the betaA3-crystallin (betaA3) dimer decreased the stability of the dimer in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if deamidation altered the interaction of betaA3 with other beta-crystallin subunits.    METHODS: Deamidation was mimicked by replacing glutamines, Q85 and Q180, at the predicted interacting interface between betaA3 domains with glutamic acids by site-directed mutagenesis. Human recombinant wild type betaA3 or the doubly deamidated mutant betaA3 Q85E/Q180E (DM betaA3) were mixed with either betaB1- or betaB2-crystallin (betaB1 or betaB2) subunits. After incubation at increasing temperatures, hetero-oligomers were resolved from individual subun…
9726010	Methods for registration of spontaneous DNA instability in mammalian cells.	aging	1998-07-17	A phenomenon of spontaneous DNA instability displays itself as the low level of repair DNA synthesis that takes place during any cell cycle phases. However, there is a problem in detection of very low intensive repair DNA synthesis. This paper suggests two approaches to detect the spontaneous DNA instability. The first method involves a blockade of the DNA gaps sealing by a combination of inhibitors, hydroxyurea and arabinofuranosyl cytosine. An accumulation of single strand gaps leads to production of DNA double strand breaks and results to reproductive inactivation of cells. It was shown that registration of both these events by different methods (such as viscoelastometry of DNA, orthogonal pulse electrophoresis or comet assay for double strand breaks as well as effectiveness of colony growth for cell inactivation) may be used as suitable measure of the spontaneous DNA instability. The second approach bases on photolysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporated into repair DNA patches durin…
17996437	Skeletal muscle satellite cells and adult myogenesis.	aging	2007-12-??	Research focusing on the canonical adult myogenic progenitor, the skeletal muscle satellite cell, is still an ever-growing field 46 years from their initial description. Recent publications revealed numerous new aspects of satellite cell biology, starting from their developmental life to their role as the principal self-renewing myogenic stem cell in adult skeletal muscle and finally their loss during aging. The myogenic potential of satellite cells is under the molecular control of specific paired-box and bHLH transcription factors whose tightly orchestrated balance accounts for an effective skeletal muscle regeneration. New reports also demonstrate satellite cells relationships with blood vessels and the high myogenic potential of stem cell subsets related to both lineages.
22515240	Precipitation of salivary proteins after the interaction with wine: the effect of ethanol, pH, fructose, and mannoproteins.	aging	2012-04-??	UNLABELLED: Astringency is a complex sensation mainly caused by the precipitation of salivary proteins with polyphenols. In wine it can be enhanced or reduced depending on the composition of the medium. In order to investigate the effect of ethanol, tartaric acid, fructose, and commercial mannoproteins (MPs) addition on the precipitation of salivary proteins, the saliva precipitation index (SPI) was determined by means of the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of human saliva after the reaction with Merlot wines and model solutions. Gelatin index, ethanol index, and Folin-Ciocalteu index were also determined. As resulted by Pearson's correlation, data on SPI were well correlated with the sensory analysis performed on the same samples. In a second experiment, increasing the ethanol (11%-13%-17%), MPs (0-2-8 g/L), fructose (0-2-6 g/L) level, and pH values (2.9-3.0-3.6), a decrease in the precipitation of salivary proteins was observed. A difference in the SPI betw…
3919095	Interferons as macrophage-activating factors. III. Preferential effects of interferon-gamma on the interleukin 1 secretory potential of fresh or aged human monocytes.	aging	1985-04-??	Human peripheral blood adherent leukocytes incubated with interferon (IFN) of three different species (alpha, beta, or gamma) show an enhanced potential of IL 1 synthesis and secretion that can be revealed by a second signal provided by endotoxins or Poly IC. We have shown that recombinant IFN-gamma, compared with recombinant IFN-alpha or purified IFN-beta, has preferential effects on IL 1 secretion in fresh monocyte cultures. We have observed a progressive and profound loss of the ability of adherent cell cultures to secrete IL 1 upon aging for 4 to 12 days in vitro. IFN-gamma was found to be more efficient than IFN-alpha or -beta at maintaining (when added at the onset of the cultures) or reversing the loss (when added on the fourth day of culture) of the IL 1 secretory function. These observations suggest that the secretion of IFN-gamma during the course of immune responses may have a critical role in feeding back the cascade of interleukins in a loop of amplification, and may there…
14725788	Differential substrate and inhibitor profiles for human MASP-1 and MASP-2.	aging	2004-02-??	The mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases (MASPs) circulate in serum complexed with mannan-binding lectin, a recognition molecule of the complement system. MASP-2 cleaves the complement components C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase C4b2a. A definitive natural substrate for MASP-1 has not yet been described. We investigated the substrate specifities of MASP-1 and MASP-2 using cleavage of fluorescent amide substrates by recombinant and serum-derived MASPs. Recombinant MASP-1 cleaved Phe-Gly-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) most rapidly at a rate of 16.8 nmol min(-1) microg(-1) rMASP-1. Recombinant MASP-2 barely cleaved any of 14 substrates used. This provides means of measuring MASP-1 activity in the absence of a known natural substrate. An assay for MBL-bound MASP-1 was established using the substrate Val-Pro-Arg-AMC. Assay of MBL-bound MASP-2 was done by cleavage of a natural protein substrate, C4. The condition of the serum used for the assays is important; simulated a…
16079181	Evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved cellular localizations and functions of human SIRT proteins.	lifespan, aging	2005-10-??	Sir2 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that extends lifespan in yeast and worms. This study examines seven human proteins homologous to Sir2 (SIRT1 through SIRT7) for cellular localization, expression profiles, protein deacetylation activity, and effects on human cell lifespan. We found that: 1) three nuclear SIRT proteins (SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7) show different subnuclear localizations: SIRT6 and SIRT7 are associated with heterochromatic regions and nucleoli, respectively, where yeast Sir2 functions; 2) SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are localized in mitochondria, an organelle that links aging and energy metabolism; 3) cellular p53 is a major in vivo substrate of SIRT1 deacetylase, but not the other six SIRT proteins; 4) SIRT1, but not the other two nuclear SIRT proteins, shows an in vitro deacetylase activity on histone H4 and p53 peptides; and 5) overexpression of any one of the seven SIRT proteins does not extend cellular replicative lifespan in normal human fibroblasts or prostate…
28322715	West Nile Virus Seroprevalence, Connecticut, USA, 2000-2014.	aging	2017-??-??	West Nile virus (WNV) infection is mainly asymptomatic but can be severe in elderly persons. As part of studies on immunity and aging in Connecticut, USA, we detected WNV seroconversion in 8.5% of nonimmunosuppressed and 16.8% of immunosuppressed persons. Age was not a significant seroconversion factor. Our findings suggest that immune factors affect seroconversion.
21843630	C-reactive protein is related to memory and medial temporal brain volume in older adults.	aging	2012-01-??	Recent research suggests a central role for inflammatory mechanisms in cognitive decline that may occur prior to evidence of neurodegeneration. Limited information exists, however, regarding the relationship between low-grade inflammation and cognitive function in healthy older adults. This study examined the relation between inflammation, verbal memory consolidation, and medial temporal lobe volumes in a cohort of older community-dwelling subjects. Subjects included 141 functionally intact, community-dwelling older adults with detectable (n=76) and undetectable (n=65) levels of C-reactive protein. A verbal episodic memory measure was administered to all subjects, and measures of delayed recall and recognition memory were assessed. A semiautomated parcellation program was used to analyze structural MRI scans. On the episodic memory task, analysis of covariance revealed a significant CRP group by memory recall interaction, such that participants with detectable levels of CRP evidenced w…
21708295	The presence of N(ε)-(Carboxymethyl) lysine in the human epidermis.	aging	2011-10-??	It is well known that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed in long-lived dermal proteins such as collagen, and that their formation is related to skin aging. To examine the distribution of AGEs in skin tissue, we performed immunofluorescence studies on the human skin using an anti-AGEs antibody. Interestingly, AGEs signals were observed not only in the dermis but also in the epidermis. The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of N(ε)-(Carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), an AGE structure, in the epidermis and to characterize the CML-modified proteins. The presence of CML in the stratum corneum (SC) was examined using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Concordance between the retention times of a compound in the SC hydrolysate and authentic CML, as well as with the specific mass transition of CML, was detected. This result showed that CML is present in the epidermis. In order to characterize the CML-modified proteins in …
20022107	The covalent immobilization of heparin to pulsed-plasma polymeric allylamine films on 316L stainless steel and the resulting effects on hemocompatibility.	aging	2010-03-??	For an improved hemocompatibility of 316L stainless steel (SS), we develop a facile and effective approach to fabricating a pulsed-plasma polymeric allylamine (P-PPAm) film that possesses a high cross-linking degree and a high density of amine groups, which is used for subsequent bonding of heparin. The P-PPAm film as a stent coating shows good resistance to the deformation behavior of compression and expansion of a stent. Using deionized water as an aging medium, it is demonstrated that the heparin-immobilized P-PPAm (Hep-P-PPAm) surface has a good retention of heparin. The systematic in vitro hemocompatibility evaluation reveals lower platelet adhesion, platelet activation and fibrinogen activation on the Hep-P-PPAm surface, and the activated partial thromboplastin time prolongs for about 15 s compared with 316L SS. The P-PPAm surface significantly promotes adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs). For the Hep-P-PPAm, although EC adhesion and proliferation is slightly su…
12170373	Regional differences in mechanical and material properties of femoral head cancellous bone in health and osteoarthritis.	aging	2002-09-??	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating condition common among the aging population. In this study we have determined mechanical and material properties of cancellous bone cores from two differently loaded regions of femoral heads obtained from healthy subjects and those with end-stage osteoarthritis. Densitometric properties were determined prior to compression testing for Young's modulus (EC) and yield strength (sigma(y)), after which bones were powdered for analysis of collagen and mineral content. In both OA and normal cancellous bone, volumetric bone mineral density (BMDv), apparent density (rhoA), E(C), and sigma(y) were systematically greater in the superior than in the inferior region (P<0.05). In the OA inferior region, median BMDv (0.434 g-cm(-3)) and rA (0.426 g-cm(-3)) were significantly greater than in normals (0.329 and 0.287 g-cm(-3), respectively, both P<0.05) reflecting an increased amount of tissue. The mineral:collagen ratio was decreased in OA, but this was only signi…
24440462	Effect of age and CMV on NK cell subpopulations.	aging	2014-06-??	NK cells represent an important component of the innate immune response against infection and tumors. Age-associated changes in NK cell phenotype have been previously reported that can be responsible of functional NK cell deficiency. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect CMV seropositivity and aging on the distribution of NK cell subsets with a focus on the expression of cytotoxicity-related molecules and on the expression of CD94/NKG2 heterodimers and CD57 on these NK cell subsets. Our results show that CMV seropositivity in young individuals does not significantly affect peripheral blood NK cell percentage and NK cell subsets defined by the use of CD56 and CD16 markers. In contrast a significant increase in the percentage of NK cells is observed in elderly donors, all of them are CMV seropositive, when compared with young CMV seropositive subjects. A decrease in the percentage of CD56bright NK cells, either fully immature CD16 negative or CD16+ and an increase in the CD56-CD…
25392269	Intracrine sex steroid synthesis and signaling in human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2015-02-??	Peripheral intracrine sex steroid synthesis from adrenal precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-sulfate has evolved in humans. We sought to establish if there are differences in intracrine, paracrine, and endocrine regulation of sex steroids by primary cultures of human skin epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified multifunctional genes modulated by steroids, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) mRNA expression, enzymatic assay aromatase activity, scratch assay cell migration, immunocytochemistry α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen gel fibroblast contraction. All steroidogenic components were present, although only keratinocytes expressed the organic anion organic anion transporter protein (OATP) 2B1 transporter. Both expressed the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1). Steroids modulated multifunctional genes, up-regulating genes important in repair and aging [angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1…
11746507	Distribution of somatic H1 subtypes is non-random on active vs. inactive chromatin II: distribution in human adult fibroblasts.	aging	2001-??-??	For nearly twenty years researchers have observed changes in the histone H1 subtype content of tissues as an organism develops into an adult. To better understand the consequences of such changes, immunofractionation of chromatin using previously characterized antibodies specific for human H1 subtypes was employed in the analysis of a fibroblast cell strain derived from a 37-year-old individual. DNAs isolated from immunoprecipitates were probed for the existence of a variety of DNA sequences. The results presented lend further support to a previously-proposed model (Parseghian et al. [2000] Chromosome Res 8:405-424) in which transcription of a sequence is accompanied by the selective depletion of subtypes. The data also suggest that there is more total H1 on actively transcribed sequences in these cells as compared to fetal fibroblasts and that there is less difference in the subtype compositions of active genes vs. inactive sequences in this strain. Specifically, the consequences of t…
29682159	Age-Dependent Protective Effect of Selenium against UVA Irradiation in Primary Human Keratinocytes and the Associated DNA Repair Signature.	aging	2018-??-??	Few studies have focused on the protective role of selenium (Se) against skin aging and photoaging even though selenoproteins are essential for keratinocyte function and skin development. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of Se supplementation on skin cells from elderly and young donors has not been reported. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of Se supplementation on skin keratinocytes at baseline and after exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation. Low doses of Se (30 nM) were very potently protective against UVA-induced cytotoxicity in young keratinocytes, whereas the protection efficiency of Se in old keratinocytes required higher concentrations (240 nM). Additionally, the DNA repair ability of the old keratinocytes drastically decreased compared with that of the young keratinocytes at baseline and after the UVA exposure. The Se supplementation significantly enhanced the DNA repair of 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) only in the keratinocytes isolat…
17060048	Diurnal cycle of salivary cortisol in older adult men and women with subjective complaints of memory deficits and/or depressive symptoms: relation to cognitive functioning.	aging	2006-09-??	In populations of young and older adults, it has been shown that individuals may be categorized into one of three diurnal subgroups when salivary cortisol levels are assessed over a 2-day period and compared for their consistency across days: a typical subgroup, a flat subgroup, and an inconsistent subgroup. Interestingly, recent studies have reported that the typical subgroup represents the majority of the young and older adult population, a finding that is difficult to reconcile with previous studies showing increased cortisol levels in older adults with depression or cognitive impairments. In order to assess whether a typical diurnal cortisol profile is representative across different subgroups of older adults, we assessed diurnal cortisol cycle representation in a sample of older adults with subjective complaints of depression and/or memory problems. Furthermore, given the robust relationship between cortisol and cognitive function, the present study examined the association betwee…
22566143	Development of a short-term human full-thickness skin organ culture model in vitro under serum-free conditions.	aging	2012-09-??	Skin exerts a variety of important functions to maintain its integrity and viability. It can be used as an experimental ex vivo model to study wound healing, oxidative stress, skin aging, carcinogenesis as well as topical or "systemic" therapeutic intervention in vitro. This report aims to validate a serum-free human full-thickness skin organ culture model with regard to dependency of skin viability on culture duration and location of skin cross-section (1-5) from the outer (section 1) to the inner side (section 5) of a skin specimen (5 × 10 mm). Cultured skin was analyzed in time-dependent manner for structural damage (H&E staining) and 'balance' between proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis [cleavage of caspase-3, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), TUNEL]. First structural disturbances were observed at 48 h (section 3; middle part), increasing with prolonged culture time. Cleavage of caspase-3 and appearance of apoptotic [TUNEL(+)] cells showed significant increase at 72 h in sections 4 and 5…
10331111	Regional cerebral blood flow in Down syndrome adults during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: exploring cognitive activation in the context of poor performance.	aging	1999-05-01	BACKGROUND: Prior studies have indicated abnormal frontal lobes in Down syndrome (DS). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) has been used during functional brain imaging studies to activate the prefrontal cortex. Whether this activation is dependent on successful performance remains unclear. To determine frontal lobe regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response in DS and to further understand the effect of performance on rCBF during the WCST, we studied DS adults who perform poorly on this task.    METHODS: Initial slope (IS), an rCBF index, was measured with the 133Xe inhalation technique during a Numbers Matching Control Task and the WCST. Ten healthy DS subjects (mean age 28.3 years) and 20 sex-matched healthy volunteers (mean age 28.7 years) were examined.    RESULTS: Performance of DS subjects was markedly impaired compared to controls. Both DS and control subjects significantly increased prefrontal IS indices compared to the control task during the WCST.    CONCLUSIONS: Prefron…
25541744	Quinolinyl-thienyl chalcones as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and their in silico modeling studies.	aging	2015-??-??	Mitochondrial enzymes monoamine oxidases were thought to be an emerging and useful therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. Monoamine oxidases have two isoforms, A and B. MAO-A is related with metabolism of amine neurotransmitters in the brain whereas MAO-B is concerned with aging related neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore the identification, characterization and discovery of potent MAO-A and B inhibitors is very crucial in research. A series of quinolyl-thienyl chalcones were tested against MAO-A and B. Among the screened compounds, most of them revealed potent MAO-A and B inhibition. Compound 5i presented most potent MAO-A inhibition having IC50 values 0.047 µM, while 4l showed excellent inhibitory potency against MAO-B among all the tested compound having IC50 values 0.063 µM. Molecular modelling studies were performed against human MAO-A and MAO-B for the explanation of binding site interactions.
18474459	Improvement of the dermal epidermal junction in human reconstructed skin by a new c-xylopyranoside derivative.	aging	????-??-??	Skin aging entails drastic changes in the extracellular dermal matrix (ECM) and dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). These biological alterations are reflected in the clinical signs of aged skin. A new C-xylopyranoside derivative, C-beta-D-xylopyranoside-2-hydroxy-propane (C-Xyloside) has been shown to induce neo-synthesis of matrix proteins such as glycosaminoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of C-Xyloside on markers of the dermal epidermal junction. Basement membrane components, collagen IV, collagen VII and laminin 5 as well as sub-epidermal dermal markers, pro-collagen I and fibrillin 1 were analysed using immunohistochemistry in a reconstructed skin model, including a dermal equivalent populated with living fibroblasts. Levels of mRNA of collagen VII alpha1 and collagen IV alpha1 were evaluated in dermal fibroblasts using RT-PCR. The results showed that C-Xyloside significantly induced a higher deposition of basement membrane an…
29498767	Dermal fibroblasts can activate matrix metalloproteinase-1 independent of keratinocytes via plasmin in a 3D collagen model.	aging	2018-??-??	Photoaging of the skin is marked by obvious wrinkles and mainly depends on degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the dermis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 is one of the most important factors involved in degradation of the ECM; however, its mechanism of activation is not fully understood. It has been thought that MMP-1 is expressed by dermal fibroblasts as an inactive precursor protein that is activated by proteinases produced by keratinocytes in the epidermis. In this study, we constructed a 3D model of the dermis using collagen-embedded fibroblasts with or without ultraviolet (UV)-A exposure to mimic photoaging in the dermis. Collagen lattices embedded with UV-A-irradiated fibroblasts miniaturized and collagen was degraded to a greater extent than collagen lattices embedded with non-irradiated fibroblasts. The results demonstrate that fibroblasts in this 3D model express activated MMP-1 in the absence of keratinocytes. Moreover, the results confirm that activation of MM…
14997030	A role of fas-associated death domain (FADD) in increased apoptosis in aged humans.	aging	2004-01-??	Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is an adapter protein that is recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) during signaling via death receptors. FADD is a common conduit in both CD95-mediated and TNF-R-mediated apoptosis. In aging, T cells show increased susceptibility to death receptor-induced apoptosis. Therefore, in this investigation, we have examined the role of FADD in increased TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes from aged humans. Our study shows that FADD expression is increased in lymphocytes from aged humans as compared to those from young subjects. Furthermore, transfection of aged lymphocytes with FADD dominant negative (FADD dn) plasmid resulted in the reduction of TNF-induced apoptosis in aged lymphocytes to a level comparable to that of young subjects. In addition, overexpression of FADD by transfection of lymphocytes from young subjects with wild-type FADD (FADD wt) resulted in increased apoptosis of young lymphocytes to a level comparable to that …
15452867	Cortical dopamine D2 receptors in type 1 and 2 alcoholics measured with human whole hemisphere autoradiography.	aging	2004-12-01	Alcoholism has been associated with lower density of striatal dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors, but there is much less data on cortical DA D(2) receptors. We evaluated the [(125)I]epidepride binding to DA D(2) receptors in Cloninger type 1 and 2 alcoholics and controls in frontal, temporal, and anterior cingulate cortices by using human postmortem whole hemispheric autoradiography, which provides high-resolution images corresponding to positron emission tomographic (PET) studies. Type 1 alcoholics had lower and type 2 alcoholics had higher DA D(2) receptor density in all cortical areas compared to controls. Although the results did not reach statistical significance, the effect sizes were high. The DA D(2) receptor density in type 2 alcoholics decreased statistically significantly with age, and after correcting for age the binding values also fell below the level of controls. A statistically non-significant tendency towards a decrease of cortical DA D(2) receptors was seen in controls, whe…
26292968	miR-526b targets 3' UTR of MMP1 mRNA.	aging	2015-08-21	Regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is important for many physiological processes involving cancers, inflammation, tissue remodeling and skin aging. Here, we report the novel finding that the expression of MMP1 mRNA is downregulated by the overexpression of miR-526b which is a member of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC). Our analysis using reporter constructs containing the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of MMP1 and its mutant form showed that the region from 377-383 in the 3' UTR of MMP1 is critical for targeting by miR-526b. In addition, the expression pattern of miR-526b and MMP1 mRNA showed reverse relation between adult dermal and neonatal fibroblasts. We show for the first time that miR-526b, an miRNA belonging to C19MC, can target the 377-383 region of the MMP1 3' UTR.
20132235	Inhibitory effect of resveratrol derivative BTM-0512 on high glucose-induced cell senescence involves dimethylaminohydrolase/asymmetric dimethylarginine pathway.	aging	2010-05-??	1. It has been reported that resveratrol exerts the inhibitory effects on aging through activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)/asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) pathway involved in the high glucose-induced endothelial cell senescence. 2. The aims of this work were to explore whether BTM-0512, a novel derivative of resveratrol, was able to exert the beneficial effect on high glucose-induced cellular senescence through regulating the DDAH/ADMA pathway and to explore whether the regulatory effect of BTM-0512 on DDAH/ADMA pathway was related to the activation of SIRT1. 3. The senescence model of endothelial cells was induced by high glucose and the cells were collected for the determination of beta-galactosidase and DDAH activity, ADMA level, DDAH and SIRT1 mRNA expression. 4. The results showed that high glucose significantly increased the ratio of senescent cells concomitantly with the decreased DDAH activity, the downregulated DDAH2 and SIRT1…
10527821	Oestradiol stimulates morphological and functional differentiation of human villous cytotrophoblast.	aging	1999-11-??	Trophoblast differentiation is a complex process involving interactions of cytotrophoblastic cells with their evolutive milieu. During pregnancy, the feto-placental unit produces large amounts of steroids. Progesterone and oestradiol are increasingly produced when the syncytiotrophoblast is highly differentiated. Furthermore, receptors to these hormones are expressed by the trophoblast. This led us to test the hypothesis that steroid production could affect the morphological and functional differentiation of the trophoblast during gestation. The fusion of cytotrophoblastic cells into syncytiotrophoblast was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching for gap junctional communication analysis (gap-FRAP), desmoplakin immunostaining and connexin 43 expression. In parallel, functional differentiation was assessed by beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (betahCG) production and human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) expression analysis. The presence of oestradiol, 1 microm, inc…
12379475	Detection of reduced RNA synthesis in UV-irradiated Cockayne syndrome group B cells using an isolated nuclear system.	aging	2002-10-21	Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human hereditary disorder characterized by UV sensitivity, developmental abnormalities and premature aging. CS cells display a selective deficiency in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially removes lesions from transcribed strands. Following UV irradiation, the recovery of RNA synthesis is abnormally delayed in CS cells in conjunction with TCR deficiency. To date, TCR has been detected in cultured cells, but not in cell-free systems. In this study, we constructed an assay system using isolated nuclei. RNA synthesis catalyzed by RNA polymerases (pol I and II) was measured in nuclei prepared from UV-irradiated cells. In nuclei isolated from HeLa and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group C cells, RNA synthesis was relatively resistant to UV irradiation. In contrast, RNA synthesis by pol I and, in particular, pol II in CS-B nuclei was significantly inhibited upon UV irradiation. Our data support the ut…
10739428	Age-related cognitive deficits mediated by changes in the striatal dopamine system.	lifespan, aging	2000-04-??	OBJECTIVE: The study examined the influence of losses in dopaminergic function on age-related cognitive deficits.    METHOD: Eleven healthy subjects (21-68 years of age) completed a set of cognitive tasks used to assess perceptual speed and episodic memory. D(2) receptor binding was measured in the caudate and the putamen by using positron emission tomography.    RESULTS: A gradual age-related deterioration was found for all cognitive tasks and for D(2) binding in both striatal structures. Statistical control of D(2) binding eliminated the age-related cognitive variation, whereas residual effects of D(2) binding were seen after the analysis controlled for age.    CONCLUSIONS: D(2) receptor binding is a more important factor than chronological age in accounting for variation in cognitive performance across the adult lifespan. Changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission play an important role in aging-related cognitive decline.
21550414	The endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) predicts LV mass independent of afterload.	aging	2011-06-30	BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a modulator of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and myocardial relaxation. The impact of NO availability on development of LVH has never been demonstrated in humans. We tested the hypotheses that elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations (biochemical marker of decreased NO generation), and impairment of vascular responsiveness to NO donor GTN, would each predict the presence of LVH and associated LV diastolic dysfunction in a normal aging population.    METHODS AND RESULTS: In 74 subjects aged 68±6 years, LV volumes and mass indexed to height(2.7) (LVMI) were calculated from cardiac MRI. Despite the absence of clinically-defined LVH, there was a relationship (r=0.29; p=0.01) between systolic BP and LVMI. Both elevation of ADMA levels to the highest quartile or impairment of GTN responsiveness (determined by applanation tonometry) to the lowest quartile were determinants of LVMI independent of systolic BP (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respec…
20035371	Human dermal fibroblast proliferation activity of usimine-C from Antarctic lichen Ramalina terebrata.	aging	2010-04-??	Type I collagen is the major structural protein in dermis and its presence is used to monitor skin cell proliferation and aging. Recently, novel usimine compounds have been found in the Antarctic lichen Ramalina terebrata. In the present study, usimine-C induced cell proliferation of human dermal fibroblast, CCD-986SK, up to 1.6-fold after treating with 90 microg/ml for 48 h. Type I procollagen synthesis was significantly increased 1.3-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold after treating with 0.14, 0.72, and 3.6 microg usimine-C/ml for 24 h, respectively, whereas no significant increase in type I procollagen was observed after treating with usimine-A or -B. Usimines are usnic acid derivatives. Considering that the difference among the derivatives is a side chain, the proliferation activity may be related to this side chain, triggering an internal signal for type I procollagen expression. Further studies still remain to clarify the signaling pathways for the type I procollagen induction, which is ac…
16951325	Mechanisms regulating the proliferative potential of human CD8+ T lymphocytes overexpressing telomerase.	aging	2006-09-15	In human somatic cells, including T lymphocytes, telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to a state of cellular senescence. Ectopic expression of telomerase results in the extension of their replicative life spans without inducing changes associated with transformation. However, it is yet unknown whether somatic cells that overexpress telomerase are physiologically indistinguishable from normal cells. Using CD8+ T lymphocyte clones overexpressing telomerase, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell proliferation. In this study, we show that early passage T cell clones transduced or not with human telomerase reverse transcriptase displayed identical growth rates upon mitogenic stimulation and no marked global changes in gene expression. Surprisingly, reduced proliferative responses were observed in human telomerase reverse transcriptase-transduced cells with extended life spans. These cells, despite maintaining high expression lev…
22991222	An inherited LMNA gene mutation in atypical Progeria syndrome.	aging	2012-11-??	Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder, characterized by several clinical features that begin in early childhood, recalling an accelerated aging process. The diagnosis of HGPS is based on the recognition of common clinical features and detection of the recurrent heterozygous c.1824C>T (p.Gly608Gly) mutation within exon 11 in the Lamin A/C encoding gene (LMNA). Besides "typical HGPS," several "atypical progeria" syndromes (APS) have been described, in a clinical spectrum ranging from mandibuloacral dysplasia to atypical Werner syndrome. These patients's clinical features include progeroid manifestations, such as short stature, prominent nose, premature graying of hair, partial alopecia, skin atrophy, lipodystrophy, skeletal anomalies, such as mandibular hypoplasia and acroosteolyses, and in some cases severe atherosclerosis with metabolic complications. APS are due in several cases to de novo heterozygous LMNA mutations other than the p.Gly608Gly, or due …
17653752	Ocular fundus auto-fluorescence observations at different wavelengths in patients with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.	aging	2008-01-??	BACKGROUND: Post-translational protein modification by lipid peroxidation products or glycation is a feature of aging as well as pathologic processes in postmitotic cells at the ocular fundus exposed to an oxidative environment. The accumulation of modified proteins such as those found in lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute greatly to the fundus auto-fluorescence. The distinct fluorescence spectra of lipofuscin and AGE enable their differentiation in multispectral fundus fluorescence imaging.    METHOD: A dual-centre consecutive case series of 78 pseudo-phacic patients is reported. Digital colour fundus photographs as well as auto-fluorescence images were taken from 33 patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD), 13 patients with diabetic retinopathy (RD), or from 32 cases without pathologic findings (controls). Fluorescence was excited at 475-515 nm or 476-604 nm and recorded in the emission bands 530-675 nm or 675-715 nm, respectively. Fluorescen…
22023562	Biomarkers of age effect on renal function in Down syndrome.	aging	2011-12-??	OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in kidney function between Down syndrome (DS) individuals and a control group related to aging.    METHODS: Creatinine (Cr) and specific gravity (SG) were assessed by spectrophotometric and refractometric assays in urine samples of 103 individuals with DS and 82 age-matched controls.    RESULTS: Significantly lower levels of Cr and SG were found in DS after puberty. Significant correlations were found between SG and age as well as between Cr and SG in DS and controls (p ≤ 0.05).    CONCLUSIONS: Premature aging in kidneys of DS patients could lead to an impaired renal function.
24211137	Crystal structures of Sirt3 complexes with 4'-bromo-resveratrol reveal binding sites and inhibition mechanism.	lifespan, aging	2013-11-21	Sirtuins are protein deacetylases regulating aging processes and various physiological functions. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, activates human Sirt1 and inhibits Sirt3, and it can mimic calorie restriction effects, such as lifespan extension in lower organisms. The mechanism of Sirtuin modulation by resveratrol is not well understood. We used 4'-bromo-resveratrol (5-(2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)vinyl)-1,3-benzenediol) to study Sirt1 and Sirt3 modulation. Despite its similarity to the Sirt1 activator resveratrol, the compound potently inhibited both, Sirt1 and Sirt3. Crystal structures of Sirt3 in complex with a fluorophore-labeled and with a native substrate peptide, respectively, in presence of 4'-bromo-resveratrol reveal two compound binding sites. Biochemical studies identify the internal site and substrate competition as the mechanism for inhibition, providing a drug target site, and homology modeling suggests that the second, allosteric site might indicate the site for Sirt…
25092058	Incidence and risk factors for osteoporotic vertebral fracture in low-income community-dwelling elderly: a population-based prospective cohort study in Brazil. The São Paulo Ageing &amp; Health (SPAH) Study.	aging	2014-12-??	UNLABELLED: We ascertained the incidence and predictors of radiographic vertebral fracture in a Brazilian elderly cohort, since no data in this field have been reported in low-income countries. This is the first population-based study to demonstrate the high frequency of vertebral fracture in elderly Latin Americans. Age, prior fracture, BMD, and bone turnover were predictors of fracture.    INTRODUCTION: Vertebral fractures are associated with increased future fracture risk and mortality. No data on incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture have been reported in low-income countries where the population's aging has been faster. Thus, we sought to describe the incidence and risk factors for radiographic vertebral fracture in a longitudinal prospective Brazilian population-based elderly cohort.    METHODS: 707 older adults (449 women and 258 men) were evaluated with spinal radiographs obtained at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 4.3 ± 0.8 years. New vertebral fracture was defin…
11867234	Cloning the AFURS1 gene which is up-regulated in senescent human parenchymal kidney cells.	aging	2002-01-23	To study the changes in gene expression in senescent cells we applied the suppression subtractive hybridization of two cDNA pools isolated from human parenchymal kidney cells in the phase of exponential growth and cellular senescence in vitro. In addition to several genes known to be associated with cellular senescence, we identified a new gene, which is overexpressed in senescent kidney parenchymal cells. The full-length cDNA consists of 5226 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 701 amino acids (Accession number: AJ306929). The gene product has a predicted molecular mass of 77.31 kDa. The ORF of the new gene shows significant homology to P-type ATPase family gene products and therefore was called AFURS1 (ATPase family homolog up-regulated in senescence cells). The consensus sequence phosphorylation site (DKTGTLT) is highly conserved. According to the GenBank database AFURS1 is mapped to the sequence segment NT_005535.3 at chromosomal region 3q26.32 and has 18 exons. T…
15840051	Urinary calcium is a determinant of bone mineral density in elderly men participating in the InCHIANTI study.	aging	2005-05-??	BACKGROUND: It is generally acknowledged that calcium excretion is a determinant of bone mineral density. Since data confirming this hypothesis are not conclusive, the present study evaluates the relationship between calcium excretion and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in a sample of general population mostly composed of elderly subjects.    METHODS: This relationship was studied in 595 subjects in good health (M/F 302/293), selected from the InCHIANTI population, an epidemiologic survey on aging in Tuscany (Italy). Of these subjects, 432 (72.6%) were 65 years old or older. Trabecular and cortical apparent vBMDs were measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography at right tibia and standardized to age and body mass index (BMI) in each gender (z-score).    RESULTS: Men in the highest tertile of calcium excretion had significantly lower trabecular vBMD, and were more likely to have a trabecular z-score of -1 or less. These results were confirmed in men older than 64 year…
28219652	Influence of age, sex and HCMV-serostatus on blood lymphocyte subpopulations in healthy adults.	aging	2017-??-??	Using a standardized immunophenotyping procedure we studied thirty-eight distinct subpopulations of T, B and NK lymphocytes in 253 healthy blood donors aged from 19 to 67. We analysed the influence of age, sex and HCMV seropositivity on each lymphocyte subpopulations and established reference ranges. We observed that aging influences the largest number of lymphocyte subpopulations with a slow increase of CD8+ EMRA T lymphocytes and of the numbers of circulating Tregs. The proportion of HLA-DR+ cells among Tregs increased with age and was correlated to the proportion of HLA-DR+ cells among effector T CD4+ lymphocytes. Sex had a major impact on absolute counts of CD4+ T cells which were higher in females. HCMV-seropositivity was associated with higher frequencies of CD8+ EMRA memory T lymphocytes while a high frequency of terminally differentiated EMRA CD4+ T cells was observed in 80% of HCMV-positive individuals and in none of the HCMV seronegative individuals.
25620312	MicroRNA-125b modulates inflammatory chemokine CCL4 expression in immune cells and its reduction causes CCL4 increase with age.	aging	2015-04-??	Chemokines play a pivotal role in regulating the immune response through a tightly controlled expression. Elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines commonly occur with aging but the mechanism underlying this age-associated change is not fully understood. Here, we report the role of microRNA-125b (miR-125b) in regulating inflammatory CC chemokine 4 (CCL4) expression in human immune cells and its altered expression with aging. We first analyzed the mRNA level of CCL4 in eight different types of immune cells including CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets (naïve, central and effector memory), B cells and monocytes in blood from both young (≤42 years) and old (≥70 years) adults. We observed that monocytes and naïve CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of CCL4 and exhibited an age-related increase in CCL4. We then found the level of miR-125b was inversely correlated with the level of CCL4 in these cells, and the level of miR-125b was reduced in monocytes and naïve CD8 T cells of the old compared to th…
29801495	Health promoting lifestyles and influencing factors among empty nesters and non-empty nesters in Taiyuan, China: a cross-sectional study.	aging	2018-05-25	BACKGROUND: In China, the problems of population aging and empty nesting have become important issues which will affect the social stability and economic development. The aim of this study was to explore the health promoting lifestyles and influencing factors among empty nesters and compare with non-empty nesters to find out their differences, so as to provide a scientific evidence for people to formulate health management strategies for elderly.    METHODS: A cross-sectional survey which used a stratified random cluster sampling method, was conducted among 500 elders in six districts of Taiyuan, China, there were 288 empty nesters and 212 non-empty nesters. The general information and health- promoting lifestyles were investigated by using the self-made General Information Questionnaire and Health Promoting Lifestyle Scale(HPLP). Two-sample t-test and Chi-square test were used to compare the sociodemographic factors, HPLP scores of empty nesters to non-empty nesters; Multiple stepwise…
14647922	Telomere length and telomerase activity during expansion and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes.	aging	2004-01-??	Chondrocyte ex vivo expansion currently performed to replace damaged articular surfaces is associated with a loss of telomeric repeats similar to decades of aging in vivo. This might affect the incidence or time of onset of age-related disorders within transplanted cells or tissues. This study examined whether more immature progenitor cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which can be expanded and subsequently differentiated into chondrocytes is advantageous regarding telomere-length related limitations of expansion protocols. Primary chondrocytes and bone-marrow-derived MSC were isolated from 12 donors, expanded separately to 4 x 10(6) cells, and (re-)differentiated as three-dimensional chondrogenic spheroids. Cells were collected during expansion, after three-dimensional culturing and chondrogenic differentiation, and sequential analyses of telomere length and telomerase activity were performed. Surprisingly, telomeres of expanded MSC were significantly shorter than those from…
1892316	Methacholine airway responsiveness and 24-hour urine excretion of sodium and potassium. The Normative Aging Study.	aging	1991-09-??	Prior studies have suggested a direct relationship between dietary sodium intake and nonspecific airway responsiveness. The relationship of dietary sodium and potassium intake to methacholine airway responsiveness was examined among 273 male participants of the Normative Aging Study (age range 44 to 82 yr) using 24-h urinary excretion of these cations as a surrogate for intake. Methacholine airway responsiveness was analyzed as dose-response slope, a continuous measure of responsiveness that represents the slope of a line connecting the origin to the last point of the dose-response plot. Greater airway responsiveness to methacholine was associated with greater potassium excretion. A significant relationship between methacholine dose-response slope and potassium excretion (p = 0.014) was observed in multivariate analysis that took into account other covariates, including age, percentage of predicted FEV1, cigarette smoking, and skin test reactivity. In contrast, methacholine airway resp…
28873228	Photodegradation of Eumelanin and Pheomelanin and Its Pathophysiological Implications.	aging	2018-??-??	Eumelanin is photoprotective for pigmented tissues while pheomelanin is phototoxic. In this review, we summarize current understanding of how eumelanin and pheomelanin structures are modified by ultraviolet A (UVA) and also by visible light and how reactive oxygen species participate in those processes. Alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation was employed to characterize eumelanin and benzothiazole-type pheomelanin, giving pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) and thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid (TTCA), respectively. Reductive hydrolysis with hydroiodic acid gives 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (4-AHP) from the benzothiazine moiety of pheomelanin. The results show that the photoaging of eumelanin gives rise to free PTCA (produced by peroxidation in situ) and pyrrole-2,3,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (PTeCA, produced by cross-linking). The TTCA/4-AHP ratio increases with photoaging, indicating the conversion of benzothiazine to the benzothiazole moiety. Analysis of those markers and their r…
21732364	Duplicated chromosomal fragments stabilize shortened telomeres in normal human IMR-90 cells before transition to senescence.	aging	2012-05-??	To assess why during in vitro aging of fibroblasts the maintenance of chromosomal stability is effective or occasionally fails, a detailed cytogenetic analysis was performed in normal human IMR-90 fetal lung fibroblasts. The onset of senescence was inferred from proliferation activity, expression pattern of cell cycle regulating proteins, activity of β-galactosidase, and morphological features. Over the period of proliferation, a moderate increase of non-transmissible structural chromosomal aberrations was observed. In addition, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH and mBAND) techniques, we detected clonally expanding translocations in up to 70% of the analyzed metaphases, all involving one homolog of chromosome 9 as an acceptor. Notably, chromosomes are randomly involved as donor-chromosomes of the translocated terminal acentric fragments. These fragments result from duplication because the donor chromosomes are apparently unchanged. Interstitial telomeric signals were dete…
12166979	Relationship between MALDI-TOF analysis of beta-CN f193-209 concentration and sensory evaluation of bitterness intensity of aged cheddar cheese.	aging	2002-08-14	An internal standard method was previously developed to measure the concentration of a synthetic bitter peptide, beta-CN f193-209, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between beta-CN f193-209 concentration in an aqueous extract of aged Cheddar cheese and bitterness intensity of the cheese. Concentrations of beta-CN f193-209 in cheese extracts were determined by MALDI-TOF at 0, 120, 180, and 270 days. Trained panels evaluated the bitterness intensity of the cheeses at 180 and 270 days. Correlation coefficients between MALDI and sensory data at 180 and 270 days were 0.803 and 0.554, respectively. The decreased correlation may be due to the presence of other bitter peptides more responsible for bitterness at longer aging or the production of compounds that mask bitterness intensity.
11956187	Biochemical characterization of the DNA substrate specificity of Werner syndrome helicase.	aging	2002-06-28	Werner syndrome is a hereditary premature aging disorder characterized by genome instability. The product of the gene defective in WS, WRN, is a helicase/exonuclease that presumably functions in DNA metabolism. To understand the DNA structures WRN acts upon in vivo, we examined its substrate preferences for unwinding. WRN unwound a 3'-single-stranded (ss)DNA-tailed duplex substrate with streptavidin bound to the end of the 3'-ssDNA tail, suggesting that WRN does not require a free DNA end to unwind the duplex; however, WRN was completely blocked by streptavidin bound to the 3'-ssDNA tail 6 nucleotides upstream of the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction. WRN efficiently unwound the forked duplex with streptavidin bound just upstream of the junction, suggesting that WRN recognizes elements of the fork structure to initiate unwinding. WRN unwound two important intermediates of replication/repair, a 5'-ssDNA flap substrate and a synthetic replication fork. WRN was able to transloc…
21139324	Change in sleep state of the elderly before and after cataract surgery.	aging	2010-??-??	It seems likely that the influences of light upon circadian rhythms will decrease with aging, particularly those rhythms that are more influenced by light with a higher color temperature and richer in short wavelengths. More specifically, cataract patients' optical systems transmit light poorly, especially the shorter wavelengths that affect the circadian system more. The present study investigated melatonin secretion profiles and sleep patterns before and after cataract surgery. Fifteen subjects were studied for 3 consecutive weekdays before, and one month after, their cataract surgery. UV-cutting intra-ocular lenses were used for patients after surgery. No statistically significant differences between before and after surgery were observed in the amount of light received and the amount of activity. This means that there were no significant changes in their lifestyle during the experimental period. Considering the group as a whole, no significant differences were present in melatonin …
15744438	L-Ergothioneine scavenges superoxide and singlet oxygen and suppresses TNF-alpha and MMP-1 expression in UV-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	????-??-??	Ergothioneine (EGT) is a sulfur-containing amino acid, and is presumed to function as a natural antioxidant. The purpose of this study was to identify the nature of the antioxidant activity and investigate the effects of EGT on UV-induced cellular response. In chemical studies, EGT scavenged the superoxide anion radical (*O(2)(-)) and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). In cultured fibroblasts, EGT suppressed TNF-alpha up-regulation by UVB irradiation. In addition, in fibroblasts exposed to UV-A, EGT suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) protein by nearly 50% and reduced MMP-1 mRNA expression. From these results, we conclude that EGT scavenges reactive oxygen species generated by both Type I and Type II photosensitization and suppresses both TNF-alpha expression and MMP-1 at their transcriptional level. EGT may reduce skin anti-aging effects after UV irradiation by the scavenging of *O(2)(-) and (1)O(2), and reducing signals for protease and inflammatory activity.
2941624	Plasma levels of steroid glucuronides in prepubertal, adult and elderly men.	aging	1986-05-??	The present study has been designed to measure the levels of C-19 steroids and their glucuronide derivatives (G) in the plasma of males at three different ages: (1) 4-7 years old, (2) 20-35 years old and (3) 55-70 years old. In 4-7 years old, the plasma levels of the free and conjugated C-19 steroids were almost undetectable. From the data obtained in both groups of adult men, it appeared that except for androsterone, the levels of all free C-19 steroids were diminished by 10-70% during aging. In adult men, androsterone-G was the predominant C-19 steroid-G in plasma. The levels of androsterone-G, in the group of 20-35 years old, exceed by 3 and 20-fold the levels of androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol-G and androstane-3 beta, 17 beta-diol-G, respectively. During aging, while the levels of androsterone-G and androstane-3 beta, 17 beta-diol-G were decreased or in the case of androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol-G remained unchanged, testosterone-G and dihydrotestosterone-G levels were markedly i…
19054164	Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) and androgens: validity of the measurement of free testosterone levels in the diagnostic criteria in Japan.	aging	2009-02-??	The basis of diagnosis of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is the measurement of androgen levels. Traditionally, total testosterone (total T) was also used as the primary indicator of gonadal function in Japan. In 1998, the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male was founded to conduct basic and clinical research on this issue internationally. As a result, it is said that bioavailable testosterone levels should be measured in the diagnosis of LOH. At present, however, there are a number of problems for bioavailable testosterone to become a routine diagnostic tool. Here, we will explain the various measurement indicators of androgens, measurement problems, standard values of total T, and free testosterone (free T) in Japan, and the diagnostic methods for LOH overseas. In Japan, the Japanese Urological Association and the Japanese Association of Men's Health recommend the measurement of free T levels in the diagnosis of LOH, for the following reasons: (i) It has been demonstra…
6847204	The relationship between the osmotic fragility of human erythrocytes and cell age.	aging	1983-04-15	Erythrocytes in a normal blood sample are hemolyzed over a range of hypotonic salt concentrations. In order to investigate the relationship between the distribution of osmotic fragilities and the distribution of cellular ages, the osmotic fragility has been compared with three indices of cellular age. The activity of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and the percentage hemoglobin A1C were measured in samples hemolyzed in different hypotonic salt concentrations. The osmotic fragility curve was also obtained for cells of different density separated by centrifugation. These experiments indicate that the fragility distribution is not an accurate reflection of the distribution of cellular ages. The mean fragility for older cells is higher than that of younger cells. However, cellular aging does not produce a gradual increase in osmotic fragility. Instead, it seems to produce changes which can both increase and decrease the fragility, resulting in a broader distribution of fragilities w…
16688977	Junior doctors and the full shift rota--psychological and hormonal changes: a comparative cross-sectional study.	aging	????-??-??	We studied the hormonal and psychological effect of the full shift rota on junior doctors after implementation of the European Working Time Directive, using a comparative, cross-sectional study design of male doctors in South Yorkshire. Cortisol and testosterone levels were measured and subjects completed the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the androgen deficiency in the aging male screening questionnaire (ADAM), after a week of holiday (baseline), a week of nights, and a normal working week. The results showed that cortisol levels decreased from 480.6 +/- 33.1 nmol/l at baseline (after a week of holiday), to 355.7 +/- 29.1 nmol/l post normal working week (p = 0.003); to 396.7 +/- 32.5 nmol/l post nights (p = 0.03). GHQ-12 scores increased from 0.5 +/- 0.3 at baseline, to 1.8 +/- 0.5 post normal working week (p = 0.02) and to 2.3 +/- 0.5 post nights (p = 0.005). These results suggest that there are still appreciable physiological consequences with new work patterns.
25641572	Interference Control In Elderly Bilinguals: Appearances Can Be Misleading.	aging	2015-??-??	Bilingualism has been associated with successful aging. In particular, research on the cognitive advantages of bilingualism suggests that it can enhance control over interference and help delay the onset of dementia signs. However, the evidence on the so-called cognitive advantage is not unanimous; furthermore, little is known about the neural basis of this supposed cognitive advantage in bilingual as opposed to monolingual elderly populations. In this study, elderly bilingual and monolingual participants performed a visuospatial interference control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Response times and accuracy rates were calculated for congruent and incongruent conditions of the Simon task, and the neurofunctional correlates of performance on the Simon task were examined. The results showed equivalent performance on the Simon task across groups but different underlying neural substrates in the two groups. With incongruent trials, monolinguals activated…
3106393	Serum bioactive and immunoreactive follicle-stimulating hormone levels and the response to clomiphene in healthy young and elderly men.	aging	1987-06-??	Testicular function declines with normal aging, while serum immunoreactive LH and FSH levels increase. Since there are reports of an age-related decrease in the ratio of bioactivity to immunoreactivity (B/I ratio) for LH, we used a newly available bioassay for FSH to assess age-associated changes in the bioactivity and B/I ratio of FSH in man. Thirty-nine healthy men (23 young and 16 elderly) had single blood samples drawn. In addition, a subset of these men (12 young and 13 elderly) underwent frequent blood sampling for 24 h, both before and after 7 days of clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. Hourly blood samples from the 24-h sampling were pooled, and these, along with the single samples, were assayed for FSH by an in vitro bioassay system, using estrogen production by immature rat granulosa cells as the end point, and by RIA. Baseline single sample mean FSH, as measured by bioassay, was similar in young and elderly men [386 +/- 98 (+/- SEM) and 342 +/- 77 ng/mL, respectively]. B…
18765664	Up-regulating sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-2 signaling impairs chemotactic, wound-healing, and morphogenetic responses in senescent endothelial cells.	lifespan	2008-10-31	Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) have a finite lifespan when cultured in vitro and eventually enter an irreversible growth arrest state called "cellular senescence." It has been shown that sphingolipids may be involved in senescence; however, the molecular links involved are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the signaling and functions of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a serum-borne bioactive sphingolipid, in ECs of different in vitro ages. We observed that S1P-regulated responses are significantly inhibited and the S1P(1-3) receptor subtypes are markedly increased in senescent ECs. Increased expression of S1P(1) and S1P(2) was also observed in the lesion regions of atherosclerotic endothelium, where senescent ECs have been identified in vivo. S1P-induced Akt and ERK1/2 activation were comparable between ECs of different in vitro ages; however, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) activity was significantly elevated and Rac activation was inhib…
20588086	Expression of cathepsins in human skin photoaging.	aging	2011-??-??	Cathepsins are involved in regulatory mechanisms in human skin, but their role in photoaged skin remains unknown. This study investigates the role of cathepsin B, D, K, and G in skin photoaging in vivo and in vitro. Cathepsin-induced changes in skin as a result of chronic UV irradiation were detected by immunohistochemistry methods. Protein cathepsin expressions in UVA-induced premature senescence in fibroblasts in vitro were detected by Western blot technique. Cathepsin mRNA expression in photoaged skin and fibroblasts was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot show lower protein expression of cathepsin B, D, and K in photoaged skin and fibroblasts, while cathepsin G was higher. The mRNA expression of cathepsin B, D, and K of the photoaged skin in vivo decreased to 20 ± 0.5, 25 ± 1.6 and 22 ± 0.8%, while cathepsin G mRNA increased to 2.24 ± 0.09 times that of control. In photoaged fibroblasts, cathepsin B, D, and K …
728063	An examination of the age-related patterns of decay of acid phosphatase (ACP1) in human red cells from individuals of different phenotypes.	aging	1978-08-??	A study has been made of the decay of acid phosphatase (ACP1) in the human red cell using red cell fractions of different mean ages prepared by density gradient centrifugation. Red cells from acid phosphatase type A and type B individuals were used in the study. Acid phosphatase activity of the red cell fractions was determined by two different assay methods. The results obtained were comparable and have been combined. Acid phosphatase type A and type B showed a biphasic decay pattern with a rapid early loss of activity, followed by a more gradual rate of decline. Type A appeared to decay more rapidly than type B in both decay phases. It is proposed that differences in stability between type A and type B in vivo may explain the observed differences in activity between the enzyme types. There was no evidence for the generation of secondary isozymes by acid phosphatase type A or type B during red cell aging.
23808483	The anti-aging factor α-klotho during human pregnancy and its expression in pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age neonates and/or preeclampsia.	aging	2014-03-??	OBJECTIVE: α-klotho, a protein with anti-aging properties, has been involved in important biological processes, such as calcium/phosphate metabolism, resistance to oxidative stress, and nitric oxide production in the endothelium. Recent studies have suggested a role of α-klotho in endocrine regulation of mineral metabolism and postnatal growth in infants. Yet, the role of α-klotho during pregnancy remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether maternal plasma concentration of α-klotho changes during pregnancy and evaluate its expression in pregnancies complicated by small for gestational age (SGA) and/or preeclampsia (PE).    STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: (1) non pregnant women (n = 37); (2) uncomplicated pregnancy (n = 130); (3) PE without an SGA neonate (PE; n = 58); (4) PE with an SGA neonate (PE and SGA; n = 52); and (5) SGA neonate without PE (SGA; n = 52). Plasma concentrations of α-klotho were determi…
18702236	Immunohistochemical expression of collagen type IV antibody in the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint of human fetuses.	aging	????-??-??	The objective of this paper was to study the morphology of the articular disc and analyze the immunohistochemical expression of the marker of type IV collagen in the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of human fetuses of different gestational ages. Twenty TMJ from human fetuses aging from 21 to 24 weeks of intrauterine life were studied. The TMJ were supplied by the Federal University of Uberaba. The ages of the fetuses were determined by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL). Macroscopically, the fetuses were fixed in a formalin solution at 10% and dissected by removing the skin and the subcutaneous tissue, exposing the deep structures. An immunohistochemical marker of type IV collagen was used in order to characterize the presence of blood vessels in the central region of the temporomandibular joint disc. Analysis of the immunohistochemical marker of type IV collagen showed the presence of blood vessels in the central region of the temporomandibular disc in human fet…
3968190	Relationship of finite proliferative lifespan, senescence, and quiescence in human cells.	lifespan, aging	1985-03-??	Cell hybrids were formed between human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) and carcinogen-transformed HDF to determine the relationship among: (1) finite proliferative lifespan, which we define as an age-related failure of a population to achieve one population doubling in 4 weeks; (2) arrest in a senescent state, which we define as cessation of DNA synthesis in a viable culture that is at the end of its lifespan by the above definition; and (3) arrest in a quiescent state, which we define as cessation of DNA synthesis in a young culture that is crowded or mitogen-deprived. HDF express all three of these phenotypes, which we have abbreviated FPL+, S+, and Q+, respectively. Carcinogen-transformed HDF are transformed to immortality (FPL-) and inability to achieve quiescence (Q-). They have no S phenotype because, by definition, this phenotype only exists in FPL+ cells. Fusion of FPL+, Q+, S+ HDF X FPL-, Q- carcinogen-transformed HDF produced hybrid clones that were FPL+, Q-, and S-, where the S- p…
17323726	Association of masticatory performance with age, posterior occlusal contacts, occlusal force, and salivary flow in older adults.	aging	????-??-??	PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of age, posterior occlusal contacts, occlusal force, and salivary flow on masticatory performance in older adults.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 328 independently living people over the age of 60 years. Masticatory performance was determined by the concentration of dissolved glucose obtained from test gummy jellies, which are the standardized food developed for measuring masticatory performance. Bilateral maximal occlusal force in the intercuspal position was measured with pressure-sensitive sheets. Stimulated whole saliva was collected using the mastication method. Subjects were grouped into 3 categories by posterior occlusal contacts according to the Eichner Index.    RESULTS: The multiple linear regression analysis showed that, with other variables controlled, masticatory performance was significantly associated with posterior occlusal contacts (beta = -.24, P < .001 for Eichner group B; beta = -.52, P < .…
9377726	Endothelial function in hypertension.	aging	????-??-??	Endothelial dysfunction has been documented both in the forearm and coronary beds of essential hypertensive patients. Impairment in the tonic release of nitric oxide (NO) is secondary to hypertension, while the alteration in agonist-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation seems to be a primary defect caused both by an alteration of the L-arginine-NO pathway and the production of cyclooxygenase-dependent EDCFs, such as prostanoids or superoxide anions. These latter substances curtail endothelium-dependent vasodilation mainly by inactivating NO production. Although experimental data clearly indicate that the L-arginine-NO pathway participates in the regulation of renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function under basal and stimulated conditions, data in humans are scanty and confounded by methodological approaches. A posteriori interpretation of data obtained with intrarenal infusion of acetylcholine in kidney donors suggests that endothelium dependent vasodilation in the kidney is…
25780896	CDC42 Gtpase Activation Affects Hela Cell DNA Repair and Proliferation Following UV Radiation-Induced Genotoxic Stress.	aging	2015-09-??	Cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) homolog is a small Rho GTPase enzyme that participates in such processes as cell cycle progression, migration, polarity, adhesion, and transcription. Recent studies suggest that CDC42 is a potent tumor suppressor in different tissues and is related to aging processes. Although DNA damage is crucial in aging, a potential role for CDC42 in genotoxic stress remains to be explored. Migration, survival/proliferation and DNA damage/repair experiments were performed to demonstrate CDC42 involvement in the recovery of HeLa cells exposed to ultraviolet radiation-induced stress. Sub-lines of HeLa cells ectopically expressing the constitutively active CDC42-V12 mutant were generated to examine whether different CDC42-GTP backgrounds might reflect different sensitivities to UV radiation. Our results show that CDC42 constitutive activation does not interfere with HeLa cell migration after UV radiation. However, the minor DNA damage exhibited by the CDC42-V12…
17558969	Adding to the controversy: pitfalls in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndromes with questionnaires and biochemistry.	aging	2007-06-??	PURPOSE: To determine the value of available questionnaires used for the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndromes (TDS) by correlating their ratings with a panel of hormonal determinations in a male population.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants completed the ADAM questionnaire and underwent biochemical evaluation at the local site. Assessments determined entry into Group A (symptomatic) or Group B (non-symptomatic). After stratification, subjects provided a morning sample of blood, completed the Aging Male Survey (AMS) and the newly developed Canadian Society for the Study of the Aging Male (CSAM-Q) questionnaires. Serum aliquots were analysed at a central lab for 8 putative markers commonly associated with symptomatic testosterone deficiency associated with aging: total testosterone (T); bioavailable T (BT); dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S); sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG); luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and insulin-…
1414144	The effect of a met-enkephalin analogue on growth hormone, prolactin, gonadotropins, cortisol and thyroid stimulating hormone in healthy elderly men.	aging	1992-09-??	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the guanyl derivative of the opioid analogue D-ala2,MePhe4-Met-enkephalin-(o)-ol (G-DAMME) on pituitary secretion in healthy elderly men. Nine healthy elderly men (65-88 years) and 10 young adults (20-30 years) were studied. GH, PRL, gonadotropins, cortisol (to evaluate the effect on ACTH) and TSH were measured after G-DAMME (0.25 mg iv) or placebo administration. In elderly men, the GH response to G-DAMME was reduced or absent, while prompt GH release was found in all young men. G-DAMME lowered LH levels in young men but not in elderly men. No significant variations in FSH levels after G-DAMME and placebo were noted in either group of subjects. A similar and significant rise in PRL and TSH, and a fall in cortisol, after G-DAMME was observed in both elderly and young adults. We have demonstrated that the sensitivity to opioid modulation by G-DAMME on PRL, TSH and cortisol secretion is unchanged with aging. On the other hand, the data i…
25394655	Structural and functional correlates of behavioral pattern separation in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe.	aging	2015-04-??	Structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are known to be involved in declarative memory processes. However, little is known about how age-related changes in MTL structures, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity affect pattern separation processes in the MTL. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the volumes of MTL regions of interest, including hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, and subiculum) in healthy older and younger adults. Additionally, we used diffusion tensor imaging to measure white matter integrity for both groups. Finally, we used functional MRI to acquire resting functional connectivity measures for both groups. We show that, along with age, the volume of left CA3/dentate gyrus predicts memory performance. Differences in fractional anisotropy and the strength of resting functional connections between the hippocampus and other cortical structures implicated in memory processing were not significant predictors of pe…
21412035	Fifty-kDa hyaluronic acid upregulates some epidermal genes without changing TNF-α expression in reconstituted epidermis.	aging	2011-??-??	BACKGROUND: Due to its strong water binding potential, hyaluronic acid (HA) is a well-known active ingredient for cosmetic applications. However, based on its varying molecular size, skin penetration of HA may be limited. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-molecular-weight HA (LMW HA) may show a certain proinflammatory activity. We thus aimed to characterize an LMW-sized HA molecule that combines strong anti-aging abilities with efficient skin penetration but lacks potential proinflammatory effects.    METHODS: Total RNA and total protein were isolated from reconstituted human epidermis following incubation with HAs of various molecular weights (20, 50, 130, 300, 800 and 1,500 kDa). Tumor necrosis factor-α expression was determined using quantitative PCR. Genomic and proteomic expression of various junctional proteins was determined using Affymetrix and common Western blotting techniques.    RESULTS: LMWHA of approximately 50 kDa did not significantly alter tumor necrosis factor…
24679669	Clinical features of prefrail older individuals and emerging peripheral biomarkers: a systematic review.	aging	????-??-??	Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the clinical presentation of identifiable physical alterations such as loss of muscle mass and strength, energy and exercise tolerance, and decreased physiological reserve. Individuals with one or two of these alterations are defined as prefrail. The clinical features of prefrail older individuals have been investigated to a lesser extent compared to the frail population, even though this intermediate stage may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in the physical decline associated with aging and it is considered to be potentially reversible. We performed searches in the Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases from January 1995 to July 2013 for papers about the identification of prefrail people aged 65 and older published either in English or Spanish, and the reference lists of from the articles retrieved were pearled in order to identify any which may have been missed in the initial search. Two independent revie…
19602472	Lipid and endothelium-related genes, ambient particulate matter, and heart rate variability--the VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2010-01-??	BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown that exposures to air pollution are associated with cardiovascular events, although the mechanism remains to be clarified. To identify whether exposures to ambient particles act on autonomic function via the lipid/endothelial metabolism pathway, whether effects of particulate matter <2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) on heart rate variability (HRV) were modified by gene polymorphisms related to those pathways were evaluated.    METHODS: HRV and gene data from the Normative Aging Study and PM(2.5) from a monitor located a kilometre from the examination site were used. A mixed model was fitted to investigate the associations between PM(2.5) and repeated measurements of HRV by gene polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E (APOE), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) adjusting for potential confounders chosen a priori.    RESULTS: A 10 microg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) in the 2 days before the examination was associated w…
23137924	In elderly women moderate hypercholesterolemia is associated to endothelial and microcirculatory impairments.	aging	2013-01-??	How cholesterol influences the microcirculation on aging subjects is not well known. This study evaluated moderate hypercholesterolemia effects in, treated or not, lean elderly women on brachial artery reactivity and microcirculatory function using venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) and nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC). Patients (mean age 73 years) were divided into healthy elderly (HE, n=15), treated dyslipidemia with statins during at least 6 months (TDL, n=9) and dyslipidemia (DL, n=9, cholesterol, 257±11 and LDL-cholesterol, 157±24 mg/dl). Young, mean age 23 years, women (YC, n=24), served as controls. Laboratory and anthropometrical analysis, VOP peak forearm blood flow (FBF) during the reactive hyperemia response/baseline FBF (%HYPER) and peak FBF after 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin/baseline FBF (%NITRO) were assessed. NVC capillary density and diameters, maximum red blood cell velocity (RBCV(max)) during reactive hyperemia/baseline RBCV and time to reach RBCV(max) were e…
27301153	The Aging Mountaineer: PSA screening in older men--of value or should we skip this test?	aging	????-??-??	The most recent American Urologic Association (AUA) guidelines concerning prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening have caused much controversy. One particular guideline, in regard to testing elderly men, is the center of intense debate. Currently, the AUA recommends against PSA screening in men aged 70 and older. West Virginia faces the challenge of a population aging at a rate that far exceeds the projected national rate. With such a substantial future proportion of older men, and increased life expectancy within this group, careful consideration of PSA screening in elderly men is warranted. Given the uncertainty surrounding the basis for the AUA guidelines, and the increased quality of life and remaining life expectancy for older men, we propose a view that supports PSA screening in carefully selected elderly men, and offer background to assist clinicians in arriving at a sound clinical decision in concert with the patient.
23959958	Cortisol profile and depressive symptoms in older adults residing in Brazil and in Canada.	aging	2013-10-??	BACKGROUND AND AIM: How cortisol, a stress biological marker, differs according to depressive symptoms has mostly been examined in high-income countries. Including low- and middle-income countries in research on this matter would allow examining a wider range of exposure to adversity and improving the estimates of the associations between diurnal cortisol and depression. The aim of this study is to compare the profile of diurnal cortisol and depressive symptoms in 65- to 74-year-old residents of Santa Cruz (in an underdeveloped region, northeast Brazil, n = 64) and Saint-Bruno (a suburban area, QC, Canada, n = 60).    METHODS: Home interviews included assessments of socioeconomic variables, health behaviors, depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D) and Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR: awakening, 30, 60 min afterward), and at 1500 hours and bedtime from saliva collected over 2 days. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the associations between…
2930546	[Ca2+]i independent mitogenesis in cultured human fibroblasts revealed by single cell microfluorimetry.	aging	1989-03-15	A transient rise in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) has been implicated in mitogenic induction of cell division. Individual human foreskin fibroblasts in confluent cultures examined with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 and a fluorescence microscope-imaging system had a basal [Ca2+]i which varied markedly from cell-to-cell. A transient serum-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was demonstrated the magnitude of which was directly correlated with the basal [Ca2+]i level. In contrast to serum-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, exposure to an elevated level of extracellular Ca2+, which is at least equally mitogenic for fibroblasts, did not alter the basal [Ca2+]i of single subconfluent cells or confluent cells. Elevated extracellular Ca2+ does not exert its mitogenicity via a transient rise in [Ca2+]i.
11878827	Drusen are Cold Spots for Proteolysis: Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases and Their Tissue Inhibitor Proteins in Age-related Macular Degeneration.	aging	2002-01-??	Drusen are abnormal extracellular matrix deposits characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the aging human population. The mechanisms underlying drusen formation are not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in drusen, and in the surrounding cells and tissue. To assess the extent of MMP and TIMP expression by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, cDNA arrays were screened with probes generated from cultured human RPE cells. The distribution of MMP-1, -2 and -3 and TIMP-1, -2, -3 and -4 was determined using immunohistochemistry in human RPE choroid from donor eyes with and without a clinical history of AMD. Gelatinase activity was assessed in unfixed frozen sections using in situ zymography. In cultured RPE cells, expression of 10 MMP and all four known TIMP mRNAs was detected. MMP immunoreactivity was widespread…
26978189	Age-Related and Heteroplasmy-Related Variation in Human mtDNA Copy Number.	aging	2016-03-??	The mitochondrial (mt) genome is present in many copies in human cells, and intra-individual variation in mtDNA sequences is known as heteroplasmy. Recent studies found that heteroplasmies are highly tissue-specific, site-specific, and allele-specific, however the functional implications have not been explored. This study investigates variation in mtDNA copy numbers (mtCN) in 12 different tissues obtained at autopsy from 152 individuals (ranging in age from 3 days to 96 years). Three different methods to estimate mtCN were compared: shotgun sequencing (in 4 tissues), capture-enriched sequencing (in 12 tissues) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, in 2 tissues). The highest precision in mtCN estimation was achieved using shotgun sequencing data. However, capture-enrichment data provide reliable estimates of relative (albeit not absolute) mtCNs. Comparisons of mtCN from different tissues of the same individual revealed that mtCNs in different tissues are, with few exceptions, uncorrelated. He…
19799611	alphaB-crystallin: a novel p53-target gene required for p53-dependent apoptosis.	aging	2009-12-??	The p53 protein is a transcription factor that trans-activates various genes in response to DNA-damaging stress. To search for new p53-target genes, we applied a cDNA microarray system using two independent p53-inducible cell lines, followed by in silico analysis to detect p53 response elements. Here, we report on crystallin alpha B gene (CRYAB), which encodes alphaB-crystallin, and is one of the genes directly trans-activated by p53. We confirmed it is directly transcribed by p53 using promoter analysis, deletion reporter assay, ChIP assay and EMSA. alphaB-crystallin is also upregulated in a p53-dependent manner and binds to the DNA-binding domain of p53. Overexpression of alphaB-crystallin increased p53 protein and, in contrast, repression of alphaB-crystallin decreased p53 protein. Interestingly, both overexpression and repression of alphaB-crystallin reduced p53-dependent apoptosis. In conclusion, we identified that alphaB-crystallin was a novel p53-target gene and required for p53…
24138783	Thyroid hormones are associated with exposure to persistent organic pollutants in aging residents of upper Hudson River communities.	aging	????-??-??	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and thyroid hormones in an aging population. Forty-eight women and 66 men, aged 55-74 years and living in upper Hudson River communities completed a questionnaire and provided blood specimens. Serum was analyzed for thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH), free (fT4) and total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and for POPs. POPs included 39 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD), and nine polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) determined by high-resolution gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry detection (HRGC-HRMS). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between thyroid hormones and sums of POPs, adjusted for covariates and stratified by sex. Effects were expressed as …
1936192	Flow cytometric analysis of human erythrocytes: II. Possible identification of senescent RBC with fluorescently labelled wheat germ agglutinin.	aging	1991-??-??	In the first paper of a series (Gutowski, et al., 1991) we discussed the use of flow cytometry to follow at the cellular level the aging of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation, using fluorescently labelled lectins and goat anti-human-IgG and -IgM. The Coulter Epics 541 was used for those studies. In this report we describe more extensive experiments using the Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer, and compare the results with those obtained with the Coulter Epics 541. By changing sample conditions from isotonic to hypotonic, compensation for differences of the two instruments was accomplished. We confirmed our previous observations that RBC react very strongly with fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) and that there is little change in the intensity of fluorescence given by RBC of all sizes with the exception of the smallest. Reactivity with FITC-WGA is markedly decreased in the presence of competitive inhibitors of sialic acid or upon enzymatic remov…
21054112	Multiphoton microscopy of engineered dermal substitutes: assessment of 3-D collagen matrix remodeling induced by fibroblast contraction.	aging	????-??-??	Dermal fibroblasts are responsible for the generation of mechanical forces within their surrounding extracellular matrix and can be potentially targeted by anti-aging ingredients. Investigation of the modulation of fibroblast contraction by these ingredients requires the implementation of three-dimensional in situ imaging methodologies. We use multiphoton microscopy to visualize unstained engineered dermal tissue by combining second-harmonic generation that reveals specifically fibrillar collagen and two-photon excited fluorescence from endogenous cellular chromophores. We study the fibroblast-induced reorganization of the collagen matrix and quantitatively evaluate the effect of Y-27632, a RhoA-kinase inhibitor, on dermal substitute contraction. We observe that collagen fibrils rearrange around fibroblasts with increasing density in control samples, whereas collagen fibrils show no remodeling in the samples containing the RhoA-kinase inhibitor. Moreover, we show that the inhibitory ef…
23029235	Revealing topological organization of human brain functional networks with resting-state functional near infrared spectroscopy.	aging	2012-??-??	BACKGROUND: The human brain is a highly complex system that can be represented as a structurally interconnected and functionally synchronized network, which assures both the segregation and integration of information processing. Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography can be employed to explore the topological organization of human brain networks. However, little is known about whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new optical imaging technology, can be used to map functional connectome of the human brain and reveal meaningful and reproducible topological characteristics.    RESULTS: We utilized resting-state fNIRS (R-fNIRS) to investigate the topological organization of human brain functional networks in 15 healthy adults. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding the temporal …
21985235	Isolation of mineralizing Nestin+ Nkx6.1+ vascular muscular cells from the adult human spinal cord.	aging	2011-10-10	BACKGROUND: The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains different populations of immature cells that could possibly be used to repair brain and spinal cord lesions. The diversity and the properties of these cells in the human adult CNS remain to be fully explored. We previously isolated Nestin+ Sox2+ neural multipotential cells from the adult human spinal cord using the neurosphere method (i.e. non adherent conditions and defined medium).    RESULTS: Here we report the isolation and long term propagation of another population of Nestin+ cells from this tissue using adherent culture conditions and serum. QPCR and immunofluorescence indicated that these cells had mesenchymal features as evidenced by the expression of Snai2 and Twist1 and lack of expression of neural markers such as Sox2, Olig2 or GFAP. Indeed, these cells expressed markers typical of smooth muscle vascular cells such as Calponin, Caldesmone and Acta2 (Smooth muscle actin). These cells could not differentiate into cho…
17666595	Symptoms associated with menopausal transition and reproductive hormones in midlife women.	aging	2007-08-??	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that prevalence of women with menopausal symptoms of hot flushes; aches, joint pain, and stiffness; depressed mood; poor sleep; decreased libido; or vaginal dryness increases with progression through the menopausal transition.    METHODS: Women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study were assessed longitudinally for 9 years. Data were obtained from structured interviews, a validated symptom questionnaire, menstrual bleeding dates and early follicular hormone measures (estradiol [E2], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and inhibin b). Menopausal stages were based on menstrual bleeding patterns. Other risk factors included age, race, history of depression, current smoking, body mass index, and perceived stress. Generalized linear regression models for repeated measures were used to estimate associations among the variables with each symptom.    RESULTS: The prevalence of hot flushes; aches, joint pain, and stiffness; and depressed mood increased in the menopaus…
18715936	hTERT alone immortalizes epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules without changing their functional characteristics.	aging	2008-11-??	Telomere-dependent replicative senescence is one of the mechanisms that limit the number of population doublings of normal human cells. By overexpression of telomerase, cells of various origins have been successfully immortalized without changing the phenotype. While a limited number of telomerase-immortalized cells of epithelial origin are available, none of renal origin has been reported so far. Here we have established simple and safe conditions that allow serial passaging of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) until entry into telomere-dependent replicative senescence. As reported for other cells, senescence of RPTECs is characterized by arrest in G1 phase, shortened telomeres, staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, and accumulation of gamma-H2AX foci. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) was sufficient to immortalize these cells. Characterization of immortalized RPTEC/TERT1 cells shows characteristic morphologica…
23110400	Melatonin enhances antioxidative enzyme gene expression (CAT, GPx, SOD), prevents their UVR-induced depletion, and protects against the formation of DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) in ex vivo human skin.	aging	2013-04-??	UV radiation (UVR) induces serious structural and functional alterations in human skin leading to skin aging and carcinogenesis. Reactive oxygen species are key players in UVR-mediated photodamage and induce the DNA-base-oxidized, intermediate 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Herein, we report the protective action of melatonin against UVR-induced 8-OHdG formation and depletion of antioxidative enzymes using ex vivo human full-thickness skin exposed to UVR in a dose (0, 100, 300 mJ/cm(2))- and time-dependent manner (0, 24, 48 hr post-UVR). Dynamics of depletion of antioxidative enzymes including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), or 8-OHdG formation were studied by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence/immunohistochemical staining. UVR-treated skin revealed significant and immediate (0 hr 300 mJ/cm(2)) reduction of gene expression, and this effect intensified within 24 hr post-UVR. Simultaneous increase in 8-OHdG-positive keratinocytes occ…
20516658	Differential effects of low-dose and high-dose beta-carotene supplementation on the signs of photoaging and type I procollagen gene expression in human skin in vivo.	aging	2010-??-??	BACKGROUND: Although the photoprotective effects of beta-carotene are thought to originate from its antioxidant properties, some studies documented pro-oxidant effects of beta-carotene.    OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effects of 2 different doses of dietary beta-carotene on wrinkles and elasticity, procollagen gene expression and ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage in human skin.    METHODS: Thirty healthy female subjects over the age of 50 years were randomized and received 2 different doses (30 and 90 mg/day) of beta-carotene for 90 days. The baseline status was used as control. At baseline and completion of the study, facial wrinkles and elasticity were measured objectively. Buttock skin was taken to determine the type I procollagen, matrix metalloproteinase-1 and fibrillin-1 mRNA levels, and UV-induced thymine dimer and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation.    RESULTS: beta-Carotene improved facial wrinkles and elasticity significantly only in the low-dose group. Th…
24329046	Age-related differences in the dynamic architecture of intrinsic networks.	aging	2014-05-??	Correlations among low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal reflect the connectivity of intrinsic large-scale networks in the brain. These correlations have typically been characterized over the entire timecourse (mean connectivity), but the mean correlations between regions vary dynamically. By focusing on the linear relationship between activity in network nodes within the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and fronto-parietal task control network (FPTC) captured by their inter-correlations, we demonstrate that this dynamic pattern of fluctuations reveals a detailed substructure, that this substructure is robust across individuals, and that the expression of specific factors is correlated with age. To do this, we conducted a chained P-technique factor analysis of the correlations in nonoverlapping temporal windows across N=145 normal aging subjects (age 56-89). The expression of factors within the DMN, FPTC, and…
16150736	Modulation of Werner syndrome protein function by a single mutation in the conserved RecQ domain.	aging	2005-11-25	Naturally occurring mutations in the human RECQ3 gene result in truncated Werner protein (WRN) and manifest as a rare premature aging disorder, Werner syndrome. Cellular and biochemical studies suggest a multifaceted role of WRN in DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance. The RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain of WRN was determined previously to be the major site of interaction for DNA and proteins. By using site-directed mutagenesis in the WRN RQC domain, we determined which amino acids might be playing a critical role in WRN function. A site-directed mutation at Lys-1016 significantly decreased WRN binding to fork or bubble DNA substrates. Moreover, the Lys-1016 mutation markedly reduced WRN helicase activity on fork, D-loop, and Holliday junction substrates in addition to reducing significantly the ability of WRN to stimulate FEN-1 incision activities. Thus, DNA binding mediated by the RQC domain is crucial for WRN helicase and its coordinated functions. Our n…
21763283	DNA secondary structure of the released strand stimulates WRN helicase action on forked duplexes without coordinate action of WRN exonuclease.	aging	2011-08-12	Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive premature aging disorder characterized by aging-related phenotypes and genomic instability. WS is caused by mutations in a gene encoding a nuclear protein, Werner syndrome protein (WRN), a member of the RecQ helicase family, that interestingly possesses both helicase and exonuclease activities. Previous studies have shown that the two activities act in concert on a single substrate. We investigated the effect of a DNA secondary structure on the two WRN activities and found that a DNA secondary structure of the displaced strand during unwinding stimulates WRN helicase without coordinate action of WRN exonuclease. These results imply that WRN helicase and exonuclease activities can act independently, and we propose that the uncoordinated action may be relevant to the in vivo activity of WRN.
23037157	Effects of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (Nutmeg) on expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and type I procollagen in UVB-irradiated human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2012-??-??	Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light causes premature skin aging that is associated with upregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and decreased collagen synthesis. Macelignan, a natural lignan compound isolated from Myristica fragrans HOUTT. (nutmeg), has been reported to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities. This study assessed the effects of macelignan on photoaging and investigated its mechanisms of action in UV-irradiated human skin fibroblasts (Hs68) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results show that macelignan attenuated UV-induced MMP-1 expression by suppressing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) induced by reactive oxygen species. Macelignan also increased type I procollagen expression and secretion through transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling. These findings indicate that macelignan regulates t…
26877153	Does allostatic load calculation method matter? Evaluation of different methods and individual biomarkers functioning by race/ethnicity and educational level.	aging	2016-??-10	OBJECTIVES: Using nationally representative data for adults of age 25 years and older from four waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), collected from 2003 through 2010, this study examines differences in individual health markers used to calculate allostatic load, with particular attention given to stratification by race/ethnicity and educational level.    METHODS: Factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation was used. Fisher's r to z transformation test was used to determine whether or not observed differences in factor loadings were statistically significant.    RESULTS: The findings reveal the unidimensionality of the concept of allostatic load and the underlying differences in associations between individual biomarkers and summary measures of allostatic load. Additionally, metabolic processes tend to be the most important predictor of allostatic load for all adults; however, inflammatory measures are more important in determining allostatic lo…
164101	Characteristics of proliferative cells from young, old, and transformed WI 38 cultures.	aging	1975-??-??	Mitotic cells were obtained by a shake off procedure from cultures of normal WI 38 cells at various passage levels, and from SV-40 virus transformed cells. The size of all mitotic WI 38 cells was similar regardless of in vitro age, whereas cells from the monolayer displayed an age-related increase in size. Mitotic transformed cells were similar to normal in size, but no size changes were observed in transformed monolayer cells during serial passage. Ultrastructural studies of mitotic WI 38 cells revealed no consistent change in the numbers of mitochondria or lysosome-like bodies during aging in culture. Mitotic transformed cells displayed numbers of mitochondria comparable to normal cells, but lysosome-like bodies occurred less frequently. Size distribution and structural characteristic are presented in relation to the ability of cells to synthesize DNA and to divide. These results support the contention that aging in WI 38 cultures is characterized by a declining fraction of homogeneo…
1756776	Isozyme polymorphisms in human diploid cell strains for research on cellular aging.	aging	1991-??-??	Six human lung diploid cell strains established for the study of in vitro cellular aging (TIG-1, TIG-7, WI-38, IMR-90, MRC-5, MRC-9, and HeLa cells as a control) were studied by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis for allozymic differences at 18 enzyme loci. Eight enzyme loci (G6PD, PGM1, PGM3, PepA, PGD, ADA, GLO1, and ME), proved to be informative in establishing unique allozyme genetic signatures for all of the cell strains established from the same species and from the same organ. Changes in the allozyme genetic signatures were not observed throughout the life span of TIG-1 and MRC-9 cells. The allozyme genetic signatures can be used as a quick monitor of cell identification and intraspecific cell contamination.
29526871	Chimyl Alcohol Suppresses PGE<sub>2</sub> Synthesis by Human Epidermal Keratinocytes through the Activation of PPAR-γ.	aging	2018-04-01	Alkyl glyceryl ethers (AKGs) are widely used as emulsion stabilizers, and their anti-inflammatory effects are well known. Daily exposure to environmental stresses, such as chemicals, low humidity and ultraviolet light (UV), can initiate and promote the development of various skin problems. Among those stresses, it has been established that UV induces skin pigmentation and accelerates premature skin aging due to the inflammation that results. Here, we investigated whether chimyl alcohol (CA), which is an AKG, suppresses the inflammatory process. The suppression of cell damage and the reduction of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) after UVB exposure was evaluated using the Neutral red (NR) and the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assays, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of mRNAs and proteins related to inflammation were evaluated by Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assays, respectively. CA suppre…
29767675	A comparison of methods for adjusting biomarkers of iron, zinc, and selenium status for the effect of inflammation in an older population: a case for interleukin 6.	aging	2018-??-01	Background: Older people are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, which can be under- or overestimated in the presence of inflammation. Several methods have been proposed to adjust for the effect of inflammation; however, to our knowledge, none have been investigated in older adults in whom chronic inflammation is common.    Objective: We investigated the influence of various inflammation-adjustment methods on micronutrient biomarkers associated with anemia in older people living in aged-care facilities in New Zealand.    Design: Blood samples were collected from 289 New Zealand aged-care residents aged >65 y. Serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total body iron (TBI), plasma zinc, and selenium as well as the inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured. Four adjustment methods were applied to micronutrient concentrations: 1) internal correction factors based on stages of inflammatio…
2415038	Use of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in gestational aging.	aging	????-??-??	Quantitative radioimmunoassay (RIA) of the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) in serum has been used to evaluate the gestational status of 99 normal early pregnancies in contrast to 29 ectopic, threatened, aborted and/or terminated cases. Quantitative measurement of serum B-hCG-RIA standardized against the second international standard (2dIS) accurately established age of normal pregnancies in utero up to but not after three weeks postconception and with an accuracy of plus or minus four days between the third and eighth week of gestation. Quantitative urinary hCG-RIA standardized against the 2dIS were not useful for gestational aging. Useful serum hCG-RIA were identically linear and parallel with the 2dIS, had negligible crossreactivity with LH, FSH and/or TSH, and had low nonspecific binding. Of 13 hCG-RIA evaluated, only assays having these latter characteristics were able to detect ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, and/or threatened pregnancies with up to …
6978498	Old age and immunity.	aging	1982-03-??	Changes in immunoglobulin production and delayed-type hypersensitivity occur in the elderly, making it difficult for the aging immune system to meet new challenges, such as infectious agents or neoplastic cells. The maintenance and repair of host defenses is thus both a significant scientific and social goal.
603770	The measurement of red cell lifespan using 59Fe.	lifespan	1977-11-??	Red cell lifespan has been measured using 51Cr and 59Fe in 19 patients. 59Fe can be used to give results which agree closely with those obtained using 51Cr provided that the plasma 59Fe clearance curve is properly defined and the data analysed correctly. In some patients elution of 51Cr may be more than three times the normal level and the use of 59Fe may provide the only reliable estimate of red cell lifespan.
11382275	Anger inhibition potentiates the association of high end-tidal CO2 with blood pressure in women.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: High resting end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) has been shown to be an independent predictor of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in women, particularly older women. The study reported in this article investigated whether the tendency to experience, express, and/or suppress anger contributes to the association of PetCO2 and SBP in women and in men.    METHODS: The Spielberger Anger Expression Inventory was administered to 403 healthy male and female participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. Resting PetCO2 was obtained by means of a respiratory gas monitor, and resting blood pressure was obtained with an oscillometric device. The associations of resting PetCO2 and the anger scales with SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were investigated using multivariate regression analyses.    RESULTS: PetCO2, as well as age and body mass index, was an independent predictor of SBP in women with low, but not high, trait anger and in women with low, but not high, anger-out. PetCO2 was …
6578706	Changes with aging in serum lipoproteins and apolipoprotein C subclasses.	aging	1983-07-??	The effects of aging on serum lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoprotein C subclasses in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were investigated in healthy male subjects aged from the 1st to the 9th decade. The serum cholesterol, phospholipid and triglyceride concentrations, the serum beta-lipoprotein concentration determined immunologically, and the beta-lipoprotein percentage determined by electrophoresis showed the lowest levels in the 2nd decade, increased gradually with age, attained the highest level in the 6th to 7th decade and slightly declined in the 9th decade. The VLDL-low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level changed almost in parallel with the serum total cholesterol level, but the HDL cholesterol level and the apolipoprotein A concentration remained almost constant showing no age-related change. The free cholesterol percentages in every lipoprotein fraction and the apolipoprotein content in LDL were higher in the subjects in the 6th and 7th decade than those in the 2nd t…
20569460	The approximate entropy of the electromyographic signals of tremor correlates with the osmotic fragility of human erythrocytes.	aging	2010-06-22	BACKGROUND: The main problem of tremor is the damage caused to the quality of the life of patients, especially those at more advanced ages. There is not a consensus yet about the origins of this disorder, but it can be examined in the correlations between the biological signs of aging and the tremor characteristics.    METHODS: This work sought correlations between the osmotic fragility of erythrocytes and features extracted from electromyographic (EMG) activity resulting from physiological tremor in healthy patients (N = 44) at different ages (24-87 years). The osmotic fragility was spectrophotometrically evaluated by the dependence of hemolysis, provided by the absorbance in 540 nm (A54o), on the concentration of NaCl. The data were adjusted to curves of sigmoidal regression and characterized by the half transition point (H50), amplitude of lysis transition (dx) and values of A540 in the curve regions that characterize the presence of lysed (A1) and preserved erythrocytes (A2). The a…
17691205	Enhancing cell longevity for cosmetic application: a complementary approach.	longevity, aging	2007-06-??	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cell longevity is linked to sirtuins (silent information regulators), which belong to a family of enzymes implicated in gene silencing, apoptosis, fatty acid metabolism, and regulation of cellular life spans of organisms. Sirtuins are associated with genes that coordinate and optimize the functions of cells as cells struggle to survive in a stressful environment, as it is the case for skin cells. This study focuses on 1) yeast Kluyveromyces biopetides in stimulating the expression of sirtuin in human cutaneous cells and 2) the benefit for the skin of an active skin care product containing yeast Kluyveromyces biopetides.    METHODS: Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) was investigated by immunostaining, Westem blotting, and cytometry on normal human skin cells in culture and on healthy skin samples ex vivo. SIRT7 are mammalian versions of the yeast SIR2 gene. Cellular integrity and aging was followed by comet assays measuring DNA frag…
6691473	Platelet MAO activity in primary degenerative dementia.	aging	1984-01-??	Platelet MAO activity was studied in 24 patients with primary degenerative dementia and 20 normal elderly controls. Demented patients had significantly higher platelet MAO activity than did controls. The increase was greater than that reported to occur in normal aging.
23095637	RECQ1 is required for cellular resistance to replication stress and catalyzes strand exchange on stalled replication fork structures.	aging	2012-11-15	RECQ1 is the most abundant of the five human RecQ helicases, but little is known about its biological significance. Recent studies indicate that RECQ1 is associated with origins of replication, suggesting a possible role in DNA replication. However, the functional role of RECQ1 at damaged or stalled replication forks is still unknown. Here, for the first time, we show that RECQ1 promotes strand exchange on synthetic stalled replication fork-mimicking structures and comparatively analyze RECQ1 with the other human RecQ helicases. RECQ1 actively unwinds the leading strand of the fork, similar to WRN, while RECQ4 and RECQ5β can only unwind the lagging strand of the replication fork. Human replication protein A modulates the strand exchange activity of RECQ1 and shifts the equilibrium more to the unwinding mode, an effect also observed for WRN. Stable depletion of RECQ1 affects cell proliferation and renders human cells sensitive to various DNA damaging agents that directly or indirectly b…
3353175	Cellular dehydration and immunoglobulin binding in senescent neonatal erythrocytes.	aging	1988-03-??	The life span of neonatal erythrocytes (60-80 days) is shorter than that of adult erythrocytes (120 days). We studied neonatal red blood cells separated on stractan density gradients to further characterize the aging process and to explore the possibility that senescence antigens play a role in the destruction of neonatal erythrocytes. Quantitation of membrane proteins 4.1a and 4.1b served as a marker for cell age and confirmed an enrichment for senescent red cells in the most dense layers of the gradients. Despite the shorter life span of neonatal erythrocytes, cord blood contained a larger percentage of very dense, K+-depleted red cells than did adult blood. ATP levels in dense neonatal and adult cells were decreased to 50-80% of normal values for unseparated red cells. Levels of reduced glutathione did not fall with increasing cell density. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of red cell membrane proteins showed increased membrane-associated globin in senescent…
23403377	Distribution of monoamine oxidase proteins in human brain: implications for brain imaging studies.	aging	2013-06-??	Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of monoamine oxidases (MAO-A: [(11)C]harmine, [(11)C]clorgyline, and [(11)C]befloxatone; MAO-B: [(11)C]deprenyl-D2) has been actively pursued given clinical importance of MAOs in human neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it is unknown how well PET outcome measures for the different radiotracers are quantitatively related to actual MAO protein levels. We measured regional distribution (n=38) and developmental/aging changes (21 hours to 99 years) of both MAOs by quantitative immunoblotting in autopsied normal human brain. MAO-A was more abundant than MAO-B in infants, which was reversed as MAO-B levels increased faster before 1 year and, unlike MAO-A, kept increasing steadily to senescence. In adults, regional protein levels of both MAOs were positively and proportionally correlated with literature postmortem data of MAO activities and binding densities. With the exception of [(11)C]befloxatone (binding potential (BP), r=0.61, P=0.15), correlat…
15181393	Physical activity in young and elderly subjects.	aging	2004-03-??	AIM: In the current recommendations for energy intake of different countries as well as in the international WHO recommendations for energy intake it is assumed that the elderly are less physically active than young adults. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare physical activity patterns and physical activity level (PAL) of young and elderly subjects.    METHODS: In 178 female (age 67.8+/-5.7 y, BMI 26.4+/-3.7 kg/m(2)) and 107 male (age 66.9+/-5.1 y, BMI 26.3+/-3.1 kg/m(2)) participants of the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population of Giessen, Germany as well as in a young age group consisting of 154 women (age 24.8+/-3.0 y, BMI 21.0+/-2.2 kg/m(2)) and 68 men (age 26.8+/-3.4 y, BMI 23.3+/-2.4 kg/m(2)) different activities like occupational work, housework, gardening, walking and sports were assessed by a questionnaire. Energy expenditure of the different activities was calculated using multipliers for resting metabolic rate (RMR) accor…
25757360	Identification of signalling cascades involved in red blood cell shrinkage and vesiculation.	aging	2015-04-16	Even though red blood cell (RBC) vesiculation is a well-documented phenomenon, notably in the context of RBC aging and blood transfusion, the exact signalling pathways and kinases involved in this process remain largely unknown. We have established a screening method for RBC vesicle shedding using the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin which is a rapid and efficient method to promote vesiculation. In order to identify novel pathways stimulating vesiculation in RBC, we screened two libraries: the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) and the Selleckchem Kinase Inhibitor Library for their effects on RBC from healthy donors. We investigated compounds triggering vesiculation and compounds inhibiting vesiculation induced by ionomycin. We identified 12 LOPAC compounds, nine kinase inhibitors and one kinase activator which induced RBC shrinkage and vesiculation. Thus, we discovered several novel pathways involved in vesiculation including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, …

In the present study we investigated the influence of two different antioxidant supplements composed of carotenoids, vitamin E and selenium on parameters related to skin health and skin aging. Thirty-nine volunteers with healthy, normal skin of skin type 2 were divided into 3 groups (n = 13) and supplemented for a period of 12 weeks. Group 1 received a mixture of lycopene (3 mg/day), lutein (3 mg/day), beta-carotene (4.8 mg/day), alpha-tocopherol (10 mg/day) and selenium (75 microg/day). Group 2 was supplemented with a mixture of lycopene (6 mg/day), beta-carotene (4.8 mg/day), alpha-tocopherol (10 mg/day) and selenium (75 microg/day). Group 3 was the placebo control. Upon supplementation serum levels of selected carotenoids increased in both verum groups. Skin density and thickness were determined by ultrasound measurements. A significant increase for both parameters was determined in the verum groups. Roughness, scaling, smoothness and wrinkling of the skin were determined by Surface…
8613658	Day-to-day variation in iron status indexes is similar for most measures in elderly women with and without rheumatoid arthritis.	aging	1996-03-??	OBJECTIVE: To determine the day-to-day variation in biochemical measures of iron status in a group of elderly women with rheumatoid arthritis compared with a group of healthy elderly women.    DESIGN: Venous blood samples were collected from each subject on 3 nonconsecutive days during a 2-week study period; subjects had fasted overnight. Variability in hemoglobin level, hematocrit value, serum iron concentration, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin concentration, and plasma transferrin receptor level was determined.    SUBJECTS: Two groups of women, one with rheumatoid arthritis (n=10) and another that was apparently healthy (n=10).    STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Variance component analysis was used to estimate the biological variation (sigma square day) and analytic variation (sigma square rep) for each iron index. The coefficient of variation (CV) for each variance component was calculated: coefficient of biological variation = CV day, coefficient of analyt…
23639251	Genetic and environmental influences of daily and intra-individual variation in testosterone levels in middle-aged men.	aging	2013-10-??	BACKGROUND: Testosterone regulates numerous physiological processes, and evidence suggests that it plays a critical role in male aging. It has yet to be determined whether the heritability of testosterone varies in accordance with its diurnal rhythm. Similarly, it is unclear whether changes in testosterone level throughout the day are genetically influenced. The aim of the present study was to determine the degree to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual differences in testosterone throughout the day in middle-aged men.    METHODS: Saliva-based measures of free testosterone, sampled at multiple time-points both at-home and in-lab, were collected from 783 male twins (193 monozygotic pairs, 196 dizygotic pairs, 5 unpaired twins) as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). The average age of participants was 55.9 years (SD=2.6).    RESULTS: Testosterone levels declined substantially over the course of the day, with 32-39% of the change occurring in t…
21506536	Electrophoretic characterization of insulin growth factor (IGF-1) functionalized magnetic nanoparticles.	aging	2011-05-17	The synthesis of composite nanoparticles consisting of a magnetite core coated with a layer of the hormone insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is described. The adsorption of the hormone in the different formulations is first studied by electrophoretic mobility measurements as a function of pH, ionic strength, and time. Because of the permeable character expected for both citrate and IGF-1 coatings surrounding the magnetite cores, an appropriate analysis of their electrophoretic mobility must be addressed. Recent developments of electrokinetic theories for particles covered by soft surface layers have rendered possible the evaluation of the softness degree from raw electrophoretic mobility data. In the present contribution, the data are quantitatively analyzed based on the theoretical model of the electrokinetics of soft particles. As a result, information is obtained on both the thickness and the charge density of the surrounding layer. It is shown that IGF-1 adsorbs onto the surface of c…
22123530	Characterization of a novel human testis-specific gene: testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1).	aging	2011-??-??	Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated physiological process that requires the correct expression and functions of thousands of developmentally regulated genes. The regulation of spermatogenesis is not well defined, since majority of the related genes have neither been identified nor fully characterized. Hence, it is meaningful to identify and characterize these genes to reveal the mechanism underlying spermatogenesis. In this study, using digital differential display, we identified a novel human testis-specific gene, testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1, GenBank DQ168992), via electronic subtraction of human testis UniGene databases from those of non-reproductive tissues. The transcript of the TDRG1 gene has an open-reading frame that encodes 100 amino acids. We next prepared the anti-TDRG1 monoclonal antibody 10B6 and confirmed that it specifically recognizes an 11-kDa protein in the tissue extracts from an adult human testicular sample (age 31 years) by Western blot analysis.…
29513641	Effect of Baicalein on Matrix Metalloproteinases and Durability of Resin-Dentin Bonding.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: In an attempt to increase resin-dentin bonding quality, this study used baicalein as a preconditioner in an etch-and-rinse adhesive to evaluate its effect on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and adhesive durability.    METHODS: As a MMP inhibitor and potential collagen cross-linking agent, baicalein was used as a preconditioner in an etch-and-rinse adhesive system. The degree of conversion was evaluated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. EnzChek gelatinase/collagenase assay kits were then used to detect the MMP inhibitory effect of different concentrations of baicalein (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, and 5.0 μg/mL) on dentin powders. During in vitro bonding procedures, flat dentin surfaces on sound third molars were preconditioned with 2.5 μg/mL baicalein after being acid-etched; this step was followed by continuation of adhesive processes and build-up of resin composite. After resin-dentin stick preparation, bonding strength, failure mode, and interface nanoleakage were respective…
14729676	Telomeric DNA damage by topoisomerase I. A possible mechanism for cell killing by camptothecin.	aging	2004-03-26	Topoisomerase I adjusts torsional stress in the genome by breaking and resealing one strand of the helix through a transient covalent coupling between enzyme and DNA. Camptothecin, a specific topoisomerase I poison, traps this covalent intermediate, thereby damaging the genome. Here we examined the activity of topoisomerase I at telomeric repeats to determine whether telomere structures are targets for DNA damage. We show that topoisomerase I is catalytically active in cleaving the G-rich telomeric strand in vitro in the presence of camptothecin but not in cleaving the C-rich strand. The topoisomerase I cleavage site is 5'-TT (downward arrow) AGGG-3' (cleavage site marked by the downward arrow). We also show that endogenous topoisomerase I can access telomeric DNA in vivo and form camptothecin-dependent covalent complexes. Therefore, each telomeric repeat represents a potential topoisomerase I cleavage site in vivo. Because telomere structures are comprised of a large number of repeats…
16854705	Collisions involving senior drivers: high-risk conditions and locations.	aging	2006-06-??	OBJECTIVES: To better understand the characteristics of crashes involving senior drivers 65 and older, studies of these crashes were reviewed.    METHODS: The review focused primarily on North American studies published since 1990. Studies point to important differences between the crashes of senior drivers and those of younger drivers.    RESULTS: Numerous studies have found that senior drivers' crashes are much more likely than crashes of younger drivers to occur at intersections. Senior drivers have particularly high rates of involvement in intersection crashes when they are turning, and even more so when they are turning left. Senior drivers are more likely than younger drivers to have been at fault in these situations, typically because they failed to yield the right-of-way, disregarded the traffic signal, or committed some other traffic violation. Studies also suggest that the extent of overinvolvement of senior drivers in certain types of crashes generally increases with advanci…
21562084	Association between the Healthy Eating Index and bone turnover markers in US postmenopausal women aged ≥45 y.	aging	2011-07-??	BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported that overall diet quality affects bone status in postmenopausal women; however, the findings are inconsistent.    OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to examine the association between overall diet quality and bone turnover markers (BTMs) in postmenopausal women aged ≥45 y by using the Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI-2005)-a diet quality-assessment tool-developed by the US Department of Agriculture. Our secondary objective was to explore the associations between the components of the HEI-2005 and the MyPyramid food groups and BTMs.    DESIGN: We used cross-sectional data from NHANES 1999-2002. Multiple regression models with adjustments for relevant confounders were used to examine the relation between the total HEI-2005 score and its components and food groups and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), a biomarker of bone formation, and urinary N-telopeptides/creatinine (uNTx/Cr), a biomarker of bone resorption.    RESULTS: No associati…
21441600	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is a nuclear epigenetic regulator of mitochondrial DNA repair and transcription.	aging	2011-06-??	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a NAD-consuming enzyme with an emerging key role in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Although PARP-1 expression is characteristically restricted to the nucleus, a few studies report the mitochondrial localization of the enzyme and its ability to regulate organelle functioning. Here, we show that, despite exclusive nuclear localization of PARP-1, mitochondrial homeostasis is compromised in cell lines exposed to PARP-1 pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA. PARP-1 suppression reduces integrity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as well as expression of mitochondria-encoded respiratory complex subunits COX-1, COX-2, and ND-2. Accordingly, PARP-1 localizes at promoters of nuclear genes encoding both the mtDNA repair proteins UNG1, MYH1, and APE1 and the mtDNA transcription factors TFB1M and TFB2M. It is noteworthy that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is required for nuclear gene expression of these mitochondrial proteins. Consistent wit…
27570974	Differential Changes with Age in Multiscale Entropy of Electromyography Signals from Leg Muscles during Treadmill Walking.	aging	2016-??-??	Age-related gait changes may be due to the loss of complexity in the neuromuscular system. This theory is disputed due to inconsistent results from single-scale analyses. Also, behavioral adaptations may confound these changes. We examined whether EMG dynamics during gait is less complex in older adults over a range of timescales using the multiscale entropy method, and whether slower walking attenuates this effect. Surface EMG was measured from the left vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GA), and tibialis anterior (TA) in 17 young and 18 older adults as they walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 0.8x-1.2x of preferred speed. Sample entropy (SE) and the complexity index (CI) of the EMG signals were calculated after successive coarse-graining to extract dynamics at timescales of 27 to 270 Hz, with m = 2 and r = 0.15 SD. SE and CI were lower across the timescales in older adults in VL and BF, but higher in GA (all p<0.001); these results held for VL and GA even a…
15812830	Structural characterization of human elastin derived peptides containing the GXXP sequence.	aging	2005-07-??	The degradation of elastin, the insoluble biopolymer of tropoelastin, can lead to the production of small peptides. These elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) are playing a key role in cellular behavior within the extracellular matrix, showing a great variety of biological effects such as chemotaxis, stimulation of cell proliferation, ion flux modifications, vasorelaxation, and inflammatory enzymes secretion. It has also been demonstrated recently that EDPs containing the GXXPG motif could induce pro-MMP1 and pro-MMP3 upregulation. Elastolysis could then cause collagen degradation and play an important role in the aging process. Many experimental studies have been devoted to EDPs, but their structure/activity relationships are not well elucidated yet. However, the assumption that their active conformation is a type VIII beta-turn on GXXP was highly suggested on the basis of predictive statistical calculations. Investigation of the EDPs three-dimensional (3D) structure would provide useful i…
10337604	Relationship of lead in drinking water to bone lead levels twenty years later in Boston men: the Normative Aging Study.	aging	1999-05-??	Tap water in a city like Boston, which has old houses containing lead plumbing, is known to be a significant source of potential lead exposure. Bone lead levels integrate exposure over many years, and in vivo bone lead measurements have recently become possible with the advent of K x-ray fluorescence instruments. Thus we examined the relationship between first morning tap-water lead levels measured in homes in the 1970s and levels of lead in bone measured in the 1990s among middle-aged to elderly men who lived in those homes. We studied 129 participants in the Normative Aging Study who had lead measured in their homes' tap water in 1976 and 1977 by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometry. From 1991 to 1995, the same subjects had blood lead levels measured by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy and tibia and patella bone lead levels measured by K x-ray fluorescence. We ran multivariate linear regression models predicting bone lead levels that adjusted for factor…
25685943	Magnetofection Mediated Transient NANOG Overexpression Enhances Proliferation and Myogenic Differentiation of Human Hair Follicle Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.	aging	2015-07-15	We used magnetofection (MF) to achieve high transfection efficiency into human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). A custom-made magnet array, matching well-to-well to a 24-well plate, was generated and characterized. Theoretical predictions of magnetic force distribution within each well demonstrated that there was no magnetic field interference among magnets in adjacent wells. An optimized protocol for efficient gene delivery to human hair follicle derived MSCs (hHF-MSCs) was established using an egfp-encoding plasmid, reaching approximately ∼50% transfection efficiency without significant cytotoxicity. Then we applied the optimized MF protocol to express the pluripotency-associated transcription factor NANOG, which was previously shown to reverse the effects of organismal aging on MSC proliferation and myogenic differentiation capacity. Indeed, MF-mediated NANOG delivery increased proliferation and enhanced the differentiation of hHF-MSCs into smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Collectively, ou…
25287447	DOES LOWER SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL STATUS YIELD RISKIER BIOMARKER PROFILES?	aging	2015-11-??	Both objective and, more recently, subjective measures of low social status have been linked to poor health outcomes. It is unclear, however, through which precise physiological mechanisms such standing may influence health, although it has been proposed that those of lower status may have biomarker profiles that are more dysregulated (and hence pose a greater risk for poorer health). The main objective of this study was to investigate whether lower subjective social standing is associated with riskier neuroendocrine biomarker profiles. Data were from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), a nationally representative survey of Taiwanese men and women (ages 54-91) conducted in Taiwan in 2000. Five neuroendocrine markers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine) were analysed both separately and collectively in an index termed neuroendocrine allostatic load (NAL) in relation to status - both self-reported and as mea…
17977823	Tumor necrosis factor alpha enhances nicotinic receptor up-regulation via a p38MAPK-dependent pathway.	aging	2008-01-11	A response by key neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to sustained nicotine exposure is up-regulation. Although this unusual receptor characteristic contributes to processes ranging from aging to addiction, the normal physiologic reason for this response is unknown. We find that up-regulation of [(3)H]epibatidine binding and function in HEK293 cells stably expressing alpha4beta2-nAChR is significantly enhanced by co-application of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha. The mechanism of tumor necrosis factor alpha-enhanced up-regulation requires transcription, new protein synthesis, and signaling through p38(MAPK) as demonstrated by complete inhibition using SB 202190. This finding extends the possibilities for nAChR-inflammatory interactions in normal physiological processes and offers novel insights into endogenous mechanisms that can modify up-regulation.
17499869	Interrelation amongst differentiation, senescence and genetic instability in long-term cultures of fibroblasts exposed to different radiation qualities.	aging	2007-06-??	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to investigate aging and genetic instability in the progeny of human fibroblasts exposed to X-rays and carbon ions.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following irradiation, cells were regularly subcultured until senescence. At selected time-points BrdU-labelling index, expression of cell cycle related proteins, cell differentiation pattern and chromosome aberrations were assessed.    RESULTS: After exposure, an immediate cell cycle arrest occurred followed by a period of a few weeks where premature differentiation and senescence were observed. In all cultures cycling cells expressing low levels of cell cycle inhibiting proteins were present and finally dominated the populations. About 5months after exposure, the cellular and molecular changes attributed to differentiation and senescence reappeared and persisted. Concurrently, genetic instability was observed, but the aberration yields and types differed between repeated experiments. The…
15883631	Homocysteine and vitamin B12 status relate to bone turnover markers, broadband ultrasound attenuation, and fractures in healthy elderly people.	aging	2005-06-??	UNLABELLED: Hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the development of osteoporosis. The relationship of Hcy and vitamin B12 with bone turnover markers, BUA, and fracture incidence was studied in 1267 subjects of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. High Hcy and low vitamin B12 concentrations were significantly associated with low BUA, high markers of bone turnover, and increased fracture risk.    INTRODUCTION: Hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Vitamin B12 is closely correlated to homocysteine (Hcy). The main objective of our study was to examine the association of Hcy and vitamin B12 status and the combined effect of these two with broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), bone turnover markers, and fracture.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 615 men and 652 women with a mean age of 76 +/- 6.6 (SD) years of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). At baseline (1995/1996), blood samples were taken after an overnight fast for dairy produ…
2541960	Timolol-induced up-regulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the elderly.	aging	1989-05-??	Drug-induced up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors is impaired in the brains of aged rats but not in myocardia. To investigate age-related changes in receptor regulation in human beings, young (24 to 35 years of age) and elderly (62 to 78 years of age) healthy volunteers were treated with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent timolol maleate (10 mg b.i.d.) for 8 days. Baseline densities of beta 2-adrenergic receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membranes and heart rates were the same in the two age groups. However, systolic blood pressures were higher in the elderly subjects. Administration of timolol produced similar plasma levels in the two groups. In response to timolol, the density of PMNL beta-adrenergic receptors increased at a similar rate and to the same extent (threefold) in both age groups. Likewise, hemodynamic changes were not related to age. These results suggest that up-regulation of peripheral beta 2-adrenergic receptors in human beings is not impair…
16537449	Reduced c-Myc signaling triggers telomere-independent senescence by regulating Bmi-1 and p16(INK4a).	aging	2006-03-07	Increased mitogenic signaling by positive effectors such as Ras or Myc can trigger senescence in normal cells, a response believed to function as a tumor-suppressive mechanism. We report here the existence of a checkpoint that monitors hypoproliferative signaling imbalances. Normal human fibroblasts with one copy of the c-myc gene inactivated by targeted homologous recombination switched with an increased frequency to a telomere-independent senescent state mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a). p16(INK4a) expression was regulated by the Polycomb group repressor Bmi-1, which we show is a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc. The Myc-Bmi circuit provides a mechanism for the conversion of environmental inputs that converge on c-Myc into discrete cell-fate decisions coupled to cell-cycle recruitment. A mechanism for limiting the proliferation of damaged or otherwise physiologically compromised cells would be expected to have important consequences on the generation…
3972248	Zinc nutriture in the elderly.	aging	1985-03-??	Emerging national attention to problems of aging in the mid-to-late 1970s stimulated research to better define zinc status and requirements of the older population. The commercial exploitation of hair analysis as a way to diagnose trace element deficiencies is unfortunate. Although hair zinc levels have been useful in comparing zinc status of population groups, usefulness of this technique with respect to assessment of the individual is extremely limited.
2934192	Age-related changes in mechanisms accounting for low levels of polyclonally induced immunoglobulin secretion in humans.	aging	1985-05-??	The mechanisms accounting for low levels of T-cell-dependent polyclonal IgG secretion in old and young human adults were compared. In elderly donors, in contrast to young donors, low levels of IgG secretion by unfractionated mononuclear cells (MNCs) did not correlate with functional suppressor activity of "panning"-enriched T8+ cells. Levels of IgG secretion by MNCs did not correlate either with proportions of T8+ or T4+ cells in the MNC population or with the functional helper activity of panning-enriched T4+ cells, in either old or young age groups. In young donors suppression mediated by either 2 or 5 X 10(4)T8+ cells of "low" IgG secretors (80.2 +/- 4.8 and 90.2 +/- 1.9%) was significantly greater than that induced by T8+ cells of "high" secretors (41.8 +/- 5.7 and 71.0 +/- 4.0%). Among elderly donors, suppression mediated by either 2 or 5 X 10(4)T8+ cells was reduced in both the low IgG secretion (31.9 +/- 5.3 and 52.3 +/- 7.0%) and high IgG secreting (14.9 +/- 7.2 and 46.8 +/- 5.…
15610364	Monocyte switch in neonates: high phagocytic capacity and low HLA-DR expression in VLBWI are inverted during gestational aging.	aging	2004-12-??	Pre-term neonates are at high risk to develop early-onset sepsis which possibly is caused by an immature immune system. Monocytes play a pivotal role as professional phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells in the innate immunity. In the present study, we investigated in monocytes from cord blood the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR as a marker for antigen-presenting capability, the expression of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (FcgammaRI/CD64), and the capacity to phagocytize non-opsonized Escherichia coli. We compared 70 infants in three groups according to their gestational age (group I: 20 very low birth weight infants (VLBWI), 24-31 weeks of gestation; group II: 25 pre-term infants, 32-36 weeks of gestation, and group III: 25 term neonates). The expression of CD64 as well as the phagocytic capacity of monocytes from cord blood were highest in VLBWI (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, HLA-DR expression was significantly (p < 0.05) diminished in VLBWI…
808939	Changes of trace minerals (serum iron, zinc, copper and magnesium) in thalassemia.	aging	1975-??-??	We have determined serum Zn, Fe, Cu and Mg in 42 patients aging from 3 months to 22 years with homozygous beta-thalassemia and thalassemia intermedia and in 36 control subjects of the same ages. Serum zinc was significantly decreased. Serum copper and iron were increased, but magnesium was found to be at normal levels.
14626663	Tight control of matrix metalloproteinase-1 activity in human skin.	aging	2003-10-??	Chronic ultraviolet irradiation leads to photoaging in human skin, which is associated with degradation of connective tissue. This is partly due to the fibroblast collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase 1 [MMP-1]). Using complementary DNA array technique we demonstrate that after UV irradiation, MMP-1, MMP-3 and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) are time-dependently induced on the messenger RNA level in dermal fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo in human buttock skin. This increase in gene expression is paralleled by an increase of latent and active MMP-1 protein after low-dose UV-A exposure in vitro. In vivo the concentration of latent MMP-1 in suction blister fluids peaks 24 h after irradiation with 2 minimal erythema doses of solar simulated radiation. However, only a small proportion of MMP-1 in vitro (5.5 +/- 1.5%) and in vivo is active, whereas the majority of MMP-1 remains in its inactive proform. Interestingly, in suction blister fluid the concentration and…
19028201	Immunity from smallpox vaccine persists for decades: a longitudinal study.	aging	2008-12-??	PURPOSE: The threat of smallpox resulting from bioterrorist action has prompted a reassessment of the level of immunity in current populations.    METHODS: We have examined the magnitude and duration of antiviral antibody immunity conferred by smallpox vaccination in 246 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Of this population, 209 subjects were vaccinated one or more times 13 to 88 years before this evaluation, and stored serum samples were available at various intervals after vaccination. An additional 8 subjects who had documented childhood smallpox infection and 29 subjects with no history of infection or vaccination were included. We quantified the total vaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in each of these subgroups of participants over time.    RESULTS: Vaccinated participants maintained antivaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers above 3 natural logs essentially indefinitely. The absolute titer of antivaccinia antibody was only slightly highe…
26419271	Psychological, endocrine, and neural correlates of attentional bias in subclinical depression.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Our knowledge with respect to psychological, endocrine, and neural correlates of attentional bias in individuals with high vulnerability to developing depression - the subclinically depressed, still remains limited.    DESIGN: The study used a 2 × 2 mixed design.    METHODS: Attentional bias toward happy and sad faces in healthy (N = 26) and subclinically depressed individuals (N = 22) was assessed via a neuroimaging dot-probe attention task. Participants also completed trait and state psychological measures and provided saliva samples for cortisol analysis.    RESULTS: The subclinical group showed attentional bias toward happy faces; past use of problem-focused coping strategies when dealing with a personally relevant stressor as well as state levels of anxiety, together, contributed to this bias. In the control group, the happy attentional bias was positively correlated with activity in the right caudate. In the subclinical group, the bias was negatively associated with t…
27179410	MicroRNA let-7b induces lens epithelial cell apoptosis by targeting leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4) in age-related cataract.	aging	2016-??-??	Owing to a rapidly aging population, vision impairment caused by age-related cataract has become very common. Age-related cataract has also become one of the principal causes of blindness, and apoptosis of lens epithelial cells contributes to non-congenital cataract development. Previous studies have reported that microRNA let-7b (let-7b) is upregulated in cataractous lens epithelial cells, and the expression level of let-7b is positively associated with N, C and P cataract scores. However, the role of let-7b in the development of age-related cataract remains unclear. Here, we observed that the expression level of let-7b in the anterior lens capsules of age-related cataract was significantly higher than that in the normal anterior lens capsules. We performed ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to induce lens epithelial cell apoptosis. The results showed that the expression level of let-7b in lens epithelial cells which were treated by UV irradiation was significantly higher than that in the c…
8951574	Paracrine coronary endothelial modulation of diastolic left ventricular function in man: implications for diastolic heart failure.	aging	1996-12-??	Coordinated release of relaxing and contracting factors from the endothelium modulates arterial distensibility. Recently, a similar release of the same and other factors from the coronary endothelium was shown to modulate myocardial performance in humans. This paracrine modulation of left ventricular (LV) performance by substances released from the coronary endothelium mainly affects diastolic LV function. This was evident from the reduction in end-systolic LV pressure, the earlier onset of LV relaxation and the increased LV diastolic distensibility observed in normal subjects during bi-coronary infusion of substance P. In experimental preparations, substance P elicited similar effects on diastolic LV function, which were attributed to a paracrine myocardial action of nitric oxide (NO) because they were absent after addition of hemoglobin. In normal subjects, the myocardial effects of NO were investigated during bi-coronary infusion of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside and resembled th…
21628889	3-Deoxysappanchalcone inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human keratinocytes through activated protein-1 inhibition and nuclear factor-kappa B DNA binding activity.	aging	2011-??-??	Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), which is a primary cytokine responsible for inflammatory responses in skin, induces the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which causes skin aging. The protective effects of 3-deoxysappanchalcone against TNF-α-induced damage was investigated using human skin keratinocytes. The results showed that 3-deoxysappanchalcone inhibited MMP-9 expression at the protein and mRNA level, by blocking the activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Taken together, the inhibitory activity of 3-deoxysappanchalcone on MMP-9 expression and production in TNF-α-treated cells was found to be mediated by the suppression of AP-1 and NF-κB activation.
30205354	EcircPred: Sequence and secondary structural property based computational identification of exonic circular RNAs.	aging	2018-12-??	Circular RNAs are new class of stable non-coding RNAs, whose expressions are specific to tissues as well as developmental stages and reported to act as gene regulators. Conspicuous presences of some of them as biomarkers for cancers, aging etc. are well reported. Biogenesis of circular RNA competes with Pre-mRNA splicing using the same splicing machinery and gene loci. Also, some circular RNAs are reported to have open reading frames and internal ribosome entry site for ribosome binding, which increases the chance of overlapping features among circular and mRNA transcripts. Therefore, discriminating the Exonic circular RNAs and mRNAs solely through sequence properties is challenging. However, possible discriminating factors, such as, reports on non-canonical arrangement of exons in circular RNAs were cited. This study was dedicated to classify Circular RNAs from mRNAs by recruiting features extracted from sequences as well as predicted secondary structures and ANN classifier models for…
11822868	Identification of a candidate tumor-suppressor gene specifically activated during Ras-induced senescence.	aging	2002-02-15	Normal cells display protective responses against oncogenes. Notably, oncogenic Ras triggers an irreversible proliferation arrest that is reminiscent of replicative senescence and that is considered a relevant tumor-suppressor mechanism. Here, we have used microarrayed filters to identify genes specifically upregulated in Ras-senescent human fibroblasts. Among the initial set of genes selected from the microarrays, we found the cell-cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1), thus validating the potency of the screening to identify markers and mediators of Ras-senescence. A group of six genes, formed by those more highly upregulated during Ras-senescence, was analyzed in further detail to evaluate their specificity. In particular, we examined their expression in cells overexpressing Ras but rendered resistant to Ras-senescence by the viral oncoprotein E1a; also, we have studied their expression during replicative senescence, organismal aging, H(2)O(2)-induced senescence, and DNA damage. In this ma…
23850488	The telomere deprotection response is functionally distinct from the genomic DNA damage response.	aging	2013-07-25	Loss of chromosome end protection through telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging and senescence. Here we developed an experimental system that mimics physiological telomere deprotection in human cells and discovered that the telomere deprotection response is functionally distinct from the genomic DNA damage response. We found that, unlike genomic breaks, deprotected telomeres that are recognized as DNA damage but remain in the fusion-resistant intermediate state activate differential ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling where CHK2 is not phosphorylated. Also unlike genomic breaks, we found that deprotected telomeres do not contribute to the G2/M checkpoint and are instead passed through cell division to induce p53-dependent G1 arrest in the daughter cells. Telomere deprotection is therefore an epigenetic signal passed between cell generations to ensure that replication-associated telomere-dependent growth arrest occurs in stable diploid G1 phase cells before genome instabilit…
6520819	Epidemiology of complete molar pregnancy.	aging	1984-11-??	The epidemiology of complete molar pregnancy is dominated by two strong factors. The first is the wide geographic variation in incidence, from less than 1 per 1,000 deliveries in the United States and Canada to about 1 per 100 deliveries in Indonesia and other Asian countries. The second factor is maternal age, with an increasing risk of molar pregnancy with increasing maternal age. Both genetic and environmental factors may underlie these two risk factors. The genetic factors may include chromosomal defects that occur as a consequence of oocyte aging. The environmental factors probably include nutrition. Although many aspects of nutrition deserve further study, some new research suggests that a focus on vitamin A metabolism may be especially profitable.
870721	Comparisons of body fluid volumes, plasma renin activity, hemodynamics and pressor responsiveness between juvenile and aged patients with essential hypertension.	aging	1977-03-??	Body fluid volumes, cardiac output, PRA and pressor responses to angiotensin II (AT) and norepinephrine (NE) were compared between untreated patients with essential hypertension aged younger than 35 (EH-I) and those aged older than 36 years (EH-II). Men blood volume, total body water and extracellular volume were not significantly different between the patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects. There were no difinite differences in each volume between the EH-I and EH-II patients either. However, the distribution of blood volume was significantly larger in the essential hypertensive patients than in the normotensive subjects, suggesting that the changes in blood volume might not be homogenous in essential hypertension. In addition, blood volume was noted to have a significant inverse correlation with PRA. Cardiac output at rest was slightly but not significantly less in the EH-I and EH-II groups than in the normotensive group. A decline in blood pressure following '…
8636262	Alterations in pulsatile luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion in idiopathic oligoasthenospermic men: assessment by deconvolution analysis--a clinical research center study.	aging	1996-02-??	To investigate the nature of neuroendocrine disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in idiopathic male infertility, we studied 14 infertile men with oligoasthenozoospermia (OLIGO) and 15 age-, body mass index-, and community-matched euspermic controls by blood withdrawal at 10-min intervals for 12 h to encompass basal (8-h) and exogenous GnRH-stimulated (4-h) pulsatile release of LH and FSH (by immunoradiometric assay) as well as testosterone (by RIA). Deconvolution analysis was used to estimate endogenous LH and FSH half-lives, secretory burst frequency, amplitude, duration, and mass. OLIGO men exhibited normal serum concentrations of total, free, and percent dialyzable testosterone and estradiol, but distinct dynamic alterations within the LH and FSH axes; namely (P < 0.05), 1) a prolonged half-life of LH (OLIGO, 95 +/- 19 min; control, 80 +/- 9.3 min) and a reduced half-life of FSH (OLIGO, 260 +/- 79 min; control, 320 +/- 93 min); 2) a low LH, but normal FSH, secretor…
29190751	Acute effect of dietary nitrate on forearm muscle oxygenation, blood volume and strength in older adults: A randomized clinical trial.	aging	2017-??-??	Both recovery time of post-exercise muscle oxygenation and muscle strength decline with aging. Although beetroot consumption has been shown to improve muscle oxygenation and exercise performance in adults, these effects in the elderly has not been addressed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a beetroot-based gel (BG) on muscle O2 saturation, blood volume (tHb) and handgrip strength in the elderly in response to handgrip exercise. In a randomized crossover double-blind design, twelve older subjects consumed BG (100 g of beetroot-based gel containing ~ 12 mmol nitrate) or PLA (100 g of nitrate-depleted gel nitrate-depleted). The subjects performed a rhythmic handgrip exercise which consisted of a one 1-min set at 30% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of each subject, followed by a 1 min recovery. The muscle oxygenation parameters and tHb were continuously monitored by using near-infrared spectroscopy. MVC was evaluated at baseline, immediately after exer…
21098492	'Young' oral fibroblasts are geno/phenotypically distinct.	aging	2010-12-??	Wound healing within the oral mucosa results in minimal scar formation compared with wounds within the skin. We have recently demonstrated distinct differences in the aging profiles of cells (oral mucosal and patient-matched skin fibroblasts) isolated from these tissues. We hypothesized that the increased replicative potential of oral mucosal fibroblasts may confer upon them preferential wound-healing capacities. Passage-matched early cultures of oral mucosal fibroblasts and skin fibroblasts demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles, with several genes linked to wound healing/tissue repair. This was related to an increased ability of the 'replicatively younger' oral mucosal fibroblasts to repopulate a wound space and reorganize their surrounding extracellular matrix environment, key activities during the wound-healing process. We conclude that oral mucosal fibroblasts exhibit a preferential healing response in vivo, due to their 'replicatively younger' phenotype when compared with…
16171977	Exogenous nitric oxide enhances the synthesis of type I collagen and heat shock protein 47 by normal human dermal fibroblasts.	aging	2006-02-??	BACKGROUND: It is well established that the alterations of dermal matrix contributes to skin aging characterized by wrinkles. On the other hand, physiological NO is useful to maintain skin homeostasis such as a vasodilatation. However, a role of NO on production of dermal matrix has been clarified.    OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have attempted to analyze the role of NO on type I collagen synthesis of normal human dermal fibroblasts including expression of procollagen alphaI S(1) mRNA/protein and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47).    METHODS: The effects of NO which was generated by two types of NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), on type I collagen and HSP47 and their related mRNA expression were examined with ELISA and RT-PCR.    RESULTS: NO was significantly accelerated the production of type I collagen by fibroblasts corresponding with up-regulation of procollagen alphaI (1) mRNA. Furthermore, NO increased both levels of HSP47 protein and m…
20009374	Autonomic nervous activities assessed by heart rate variability in pre- and post-adolescent Japanese.	aging	2009-11-??	There are many studies with respect to the age-related change of the characteristics of beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV), reflected by cardiac autonomic control, especially focusing on adulthood (i.e., aging related to the incidence of metabolic syndrome) in Japanese individuals. However, it is not still clear how basic control matures during childhood. This study was, therefore, designed to explore the HRV characteristics of pre- and post-adolescent Japanese, in a cross-sectional manner. Resting HRV data was recorded in a relaxing supine position from 136 healthy individuals between 8 and 20 years (48 boys between 8 and 14 years; 88 girls between 8 and 20 years) who were instructed to breathe periodically (0.25 Hz). Frequency-domain analysis (i.e., the spectral analysis based on an autoregressive model) of short-term, stationary R-R intervals was performed to evaluate the low- (LF; below 0.15 Hz) and high- (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz) frequency powers. The HF to total power represents …
889798	Subunit structure of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase--orotidylate decarboxylase complex from human erythrocytes.	aging	1977-07-12	A complex of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase has been shown to exist in three molecular weight forms (Brown, G. K., Fox, R. M., and O'Sullivan, W. J. (1975), J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7352). The smallest of these, of molecular weight 62 000, was subjected to further study. On the basis of the inactivation of the enzyme activities, carried out in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride, and of changes in molecular weight of preparations during aging, it was inferred that the enzyme complex contained more than one type of subunit. This was confirmed by chromatography on Sephadex G-75 after preincubation in guanidine hydrochloride or with guanidine hydrochloride in the elution buffer. It was concluded that the enzyme complex consisted of two types of subunits, two decarboxylase units of molecular weight approximately 20 000 and two further subunits of approximately 13 000. The subunits could be separated and reassociated with partial recover…
29190767	High DNA stability in white blood cells and buffy coat lysates stored at ambient temperature under anoxic and anhydrous atmosphere.	aging	2017-??-??	Conventional storage of blood-derived fractions relies on cold. However, lately, ambient temperature preservation has been evaluated by several independent institutions that see economic and logistic advantages in getting rid of the cold chain. Here we validated a novel procedure for ambient temperature preservation of DNA in white blood cell and buffy coat lysates based on the confinement of the desiccated biospecimens under anoxic and anhydrous atmosphere in original hermetic minicapsules. For this validation we stored encapsulated samples either at ambient temperature or at several elevated temperatures to accelerate aging. We found that DNA extracted from stored samples was of good quality with a yield of extraction as expected. Degradation rates were estimated from the average fragment size of denatured DNA run on agarose gels and from qPCR reactions. At ambient temperature, these rates were too low to be measured but the degradation rate dependence on temperature followed Arrheni…
25546388	Exposure to non-extreme solar UV daylight: spectral characterization, effects on skin and photoprotection.	aging	2014-12-23	The link between chronic sun exposure of human skin and harmful clinical consequences such as photo-aging and skin cancers is now indisputable. These effects are mostly due to ultraviolet (UV) rays (UVA, 320-400 nm and UVB, 280-320 nm). The UVA/UVB ratio can vary with latitude, season, hour, meteorology and ozone layer, leading to different exposure conditions. Zenithal sun exposure (for example on a beach around noon under a clear sky) can rapidly induce visible and well-characterized clinical consequences such as sunburn, predominantly induced by UVB. However, a limited part of the global population is exposed daily to such intense irradiance and until recently little attention has been paid to solar exposure that does not induce any short term clinical impact. This paper will review different studies on non-extreme daily UV exposures with: (1) the characterization and the definition of the standard UV daylight and its simulation in the laboratory; (2) description of the biological a…
15356064	Evidence of early ovarian aging in fragile X premutation carriers.	aging	2004-09-??	Up to 28% of female fragile X premutation carriers develop premature ovarian failure. To test the hypothesis that fragile X premutation carriers with ovulatory menstrual cycles exhibit hormone changes characteristic of early ovarian aging, 11 regularly cycling fragile X premutation carriers, 24-41 yr old (34.5 +/- 5.7 yr, mean +/- sd), drew daily blood samples across one menstrual cycle. LH, FSH, estradiol, progesterone (P4), inhibin A, and inhibin B levels were compared with levels in 22 age-matched, regularly cycling women, 23-41 yr old (34.6 +/- 5.8 yr), at each cycle stage. Total cycle (26.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 28.2 +/- 0.4 d; P < 0.05) and follicular phase length (12.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 14.5 +/- 0.4 d; P < 0.05) were decreased in fragile X premutation carriers compared with age-matched controls, whereas luteal phase length was similar (13.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 d; P = not significant). FSH was elevated across the follicular (21.9 +/- 3.5 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.5 IU/liter; P < 0.001) and luteal phas…
17372101	Effect of intense pulsed-light exposure on lipid peroxides and thymine dimers in human skin in vivo.	aging	2007-03-??	BACKGROUND: Intense pulsed light (IPL) generates high-intensity short flashes of visible light and has been used for about 10 years to improve dermatological conditions such as telangiectasia, pigmented lesions, and skin aging. Although these systems deliver a moderate dose (10-30 J/cm(2)) of visible light, this dose is delivered during a short pulse (2-5 milliseconds), which implies a very high fluence rate (approximately 4000 W/cm(2)). For this reason, we speculated whether the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity could still be valid in these conditions.    OBSERVATIONS: Nine healthy volunteers were exposed to IPL or UV-A or simulated solar UV radiation, and then thymine dimer and lipid peroxide concentrations were determined in skin biopsy specimens of the exposed sites. Only exposure to solar UV radiation (7-J/cm(2) UV-A + 80-mJ/cm(2) UV-B) produced measurable amounts of thymine dimers in DNA from skin biopsy specimens, whereas UV-A radiation (40 J/cm(2)) and IPL (9 J/cm(2)) induced 3…
28987328	The presence of oleate stabilized ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and reduced the toxicity of aged NPs to Caco-2 and HepG2 cells.	aging	2017-12-25	The presence of food components may alter the colloidal aspects and toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs). In this study, the toxicity of ZnO NPs to Caco-2 and HepG2 cells was assessed, with the emphasis on the interactions between ZnO NPs and oleate (OA). The presence of OA increased UV-Vis spectra and hydrodynamic sizes, decreased Zeta potential, and markedly reduced the release of Zn ions from the dissolution of ZnO NPs, which combined indicated that OA could coat ZnO NPs and stabilize ZnO NPs. Exposure to ZnO NPs significantly induced cytotoxicity to Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, associated with increased intracellular Zn ions but not superoxide. When OA was added to the freshly prepared ZnO NP suspensions, the cytotoxicity, intracellular Zn ions and superoxide induced by ZnO NPs were not significantly affected. However, when ZnO NPs were aged for 24 h with the presence of OA, the cytotoxicity of ZnO NPs to Caco-2 and HepG2 cells was significantly reduced, associated with a reduction of intrac…
1664747	Absence of correlations between plasma catecholamine levels and mononuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the elderly.	aging	1991-??-??	To assess the effects of aging on catecholamine plasma levels and mononuclear leukocyte (NML) beta 2-adrenergic receptors and on the possible relationships between these two parameters, we evaluated two groups of human subjects: 18 elderly volunteers (age 65-70 years) and 13 young volunteers (age 21-35 years). Norepinephrine plasma levels were significantly higher in the elderly subjects compared to the younger ones (P less than 0.05), whereas plasma epinephrine levels were not different. Also MNL beta 2-adrenoceptor density was significantly higher in elderly subjects (P less than 0.05). The binding dissociation constants were not significantly different. In young subjects there was a significant (P less than 0.02), inverse relationship between receptor densities and plasma norepinephrine levels; this relationship was not present in elderly persons. Our data suggest that the increase in beta 2-adrenoceptors may be due to a compensatory phenomenon, owing to the reduced beta-adrenergic …
28125671	Relative Telomere Repeat Mass in Buccal and Leukocyte-Derived DNA.	aging	2017-??-??	Telomere length has garnered interest due to the potential role it may play as a biomarker for the cellular aging process. Telomere measurements obtained from blood-derived DNA are often used in epidemiological studies. However, the invasive nature of blood draws severely limits sample collection, particularly with children. Buccal cells are commonly sampled for DNA isolation and thus may present a non-invasive alternative for telomere measurement. Buccal and leukocyte derived DNA obtained from samples collected at the same time period were analyzed for telomere repeat mass (TRM). TRM was measured in buccal-derived DNA samples from individuals for whom previous TRM data from blood samples existed. TRM measurement was performed by qPCR and was normalized to the single copy 36B4 gene relative to a reference DNA sample (K562). Correlations between TRM from blood and buccal DNA were obtained and also between the same blood DNA samples measured in separate laboratories. Using the classical …
6319164	Progress of aging in human diploid cells transformed with a tsA mutant of simian virus 40.	lifespan, aging	1984-02-??	Normal human diploid cells, TIG-1, ceased to proliferate at about the 62 population doubling level (PDL). Transformed clones isolated from TIG-1 cells infected with wtSV40 and those with tsA900 SV40 cultured at 34 degrees C were subcultured up to about 80 PDL. When the culture temperature of tsA SV40-transformed cells was shifted from 34 to 39.5 degrees C at 51 PDL, the growth curve of these transformed cells changed to that of normal young cells. When shifted to 39.5 degrees C after 62 PDL, cells immediately reached the end of their proliferative lifespan even under such favourable conditions for growth as low cell density in fresh medium. Growth of wtSV40-transformed cells did not change markedly at either temperature. These findings suggest that the clock of aging progresses in transformed cells as in normal cells, around 62 PDL being the senescent state in both cases, and that T-antigen of the tsA mutant of SV40 supports the extension of the lifespan of human cells only at the perm…
22237997	Antioxidant biomarkers and food intake in elderly women.	aging	2012-01-??	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between antioxidant biomarkers and food intake in elderly women.    DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.    SETTING: Recreation Center for the Elderly in the city of Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil.    PARTICIPANTS: 73 elderly women with an average age of 71 years, 93% caucasian, average body weight 68.7 ± 13.1 kg and average BMI 28.5 ± 2.3 kg/m².    MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional status was assessed based on the Body Mass Index (BMI). Data on food intake were obtained by applying the 24h diet recall method in three non-consecutive days, including Sunday. The assessment of antioxidant biomarkers was performed based on tests for total plasma thiols and phenolic compounds. The linear regression analysis was used to assess the effect of the consumption of food groups on antioxidant biomarkers.    RESULTS: A positive association was found between thiols and intake of carotenoid-rich vegetables (p=0.03), oils, fats and oilseeds (p=0.03); a negative association…
6274112	Ultrastructural modifications of the erythrocyte membrane in Down's syndrome.	aging	1981-??-??	Spin label studies of erythrocyte membranes from patients with Down's syndrome showed no differences in the rigidity of membrane lipids with respect to normal subjects and a tendency for alterations in the state of membrane proteins. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated the occurrence of ultrastructural defects in membranes from trisomics which can be due to accelerated red cell aging as similar alterations were found in the fraction of oldest (most dense) cells in normal subjects.
315737	Pulmonary function in heterozygotes for alpha,-antitrypsin deficiency: a case-control study.	aging	1979-10-??	In this paper we present the initial cross-sectional data from a prospective study of lung aging in heterozygotes for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Using a case-control design, our cases included 37 heterozygotes for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, protease inhibitor phenotypes MZ and MS, selected because they were parents of children with homozygous alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency identified in a statewide newborn screening program between 1971 and 1974. All of the heterozygotes were less than 40 yr of age. Our control subjects were selected from a random sample of a working population participating in a longitudinal study of lung aging, using a 2:1 match of control subjects to cases, matching age, sex, ethnic origin, and smoking. Using a respiratory symptom questionnaire, spirometry, and the single-breath N2 test, we found no significant difference between heterozygotes and control subjects in terms of respiratory symptoms or pulmonary function data. We conclude that to 40 yr of age…
8011077	Determination of beta-isomerized aspartic acid as the corresponding alcohol.	aging	1994-01-??	The age-related formation of succinimides in proteins, through spontaneous deamidation of asparagine, and through cyclization of aspartic acid, is thought to be followed by the hydrolysis of the succinimide ring, yielding a mixture of "normal" aspartic acid sites and beta-isomerized aspartic acid sites (isoaspartic acid). The chemical reduction of an isoaspartyl site to the corresponding amino acid alcohol, isohomoserine, has now been investigated as a general approach to measuring the accumulation of isomerized residues in aging proteins. The methods employed were based on conditions previously found to be successful in reducing protein aspartic acid to homoserine. Borane was employed as the reducing agent, and was found to produce the expected amino acid alcohols in reactions with model peptides. In addition, amino acid analysis revealed a complex pattern of unknown products of these reduction reactions, some of which were also evident when a much stronger reducing agent, lithium alu…
23454361	Crystal structure analysis of human Sirt2 and its ADP-ribose complex.	aging	2013-05-??	Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate metabolism and aging-related processes. Sirt2 is the only cytoplasmic isoform among the seven mamalian Sirtuins (Sirt1-7) and structural information concerning this isoform is limited. We crystallized Sirt2 in complex with a product analog, ADP-ribose, and solved this first crystal structure of a Sirt2 ligand complex at 2.3Å resolution. Additionally, we re-refined the structure of the Sirt2 apoform and analyzed the conformational changes associated with ligand binding to derive insights into the dynamics of the enzyme. Our analyses also provide information on Sirt2 peptide substrate binding and structural states of a Sirt2-specific protein region, and our insights and the novel Sirt2 crystal form provide helpful tools for the development of Sirt2 specific inhibitors.
9610031	Telomerase activity, telomere length, and chromosome aberrations in the extension of life span of human embryo cells induced by low-dose X-rays.	aging	1998-03-??	We examined whether the shortening of telomere structure is related to in vitro cellular aging after multiple low-dose irradiation. We used three strains of HE cells (HE23, HE31, and HE40) exhibiting different levels of telomerase activity and irradiated these cells twice a week with a dose of 2 cGy or 4 cGy of X-rays until they senesced. The cells were in total exposed to doses of 52-208 cGy of X-rays. Only the HE31 cells, which had no telomerase activity, experienced an increase in the number of cell divisions, reaching a maximum of 120-124% of the non-irradiated controls. However, in two strains which did exhibit telomerase activity in an early passage in culture, no extension of cell life span was found. Telomerase-positive cells completely lost all telomerase activity when the cells were subcultured several times without irradiation. In the HE31 cells where the life span was extended, the ratio of cell having a long telomere was higher than those of the other two cells (HE23 and H…
14751269	A fluorimetric method using fluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside for quantifying the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity in human foreskin fibroblast Hs68 cells.	aging	2004-02-15	The senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-betaG) assay is one of the few accepted markers of cell aging. However, the cytochemical method using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) as substrate is limited in sensitivity and is only semiquantitative. Here, we modified the X-Gal method by replacing X-Gal with fluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside (FDG) as substrate for SA-betaG, and the activity was measured fluorimetrically. We showed in Hs68 cells that the FDG fluorescein fluorescence increased with increasing passages of the cells in parallel with the X-Gal method. A major advantage of the FDG method is that it is a quantitative method for the SA-betaG activity. For example, we showed that the FDG fluorescein in p30(+1) of Hs68 cells was generally stronger than that in p26(+1) cells, whereas the X-Gal method gave similar results (95 and 100%) for p26(+1) and p30(+1) cells. The FDG method was precise with a relative standard deviation lower than 10%. We …
11818423	Effects of telomerase and viral oncogene expression on the in vitro growth of human chondrocytes.	aging	2002-02-??	Senescent chondrocytes accumulate with aging in articular cartilage, a process that interferes with cartilage homeostasis and increases the risk of cartilage degeneration. We showed previously that chondrocyte telomere length declines with donor age, which suggests that the aging process is telomere dependent. From these results we hypothesized that telomerase should delay the onset of senescence in cultured chondrocytes. Population doubling limits (PDL) were determined for chondrocytes expressing telomerase. We found that telomerase alone did not extend PDL beyond controls that senesced after 25 population doublings. The human papillomavirus 16 oncogenes E6 and E7 were transduced into the same cell population to investigate this telomere-independent form of senescence further. Chondrocytes expressing E6 and E7 grew longer than the telomerase cDNA (hTERT) cells but still senesced at 55 population doublings. In contrast, chondrocytes expressing telomerase with E6 and E7 grew vigorously …
9390775	Reduced efficacy of growth hormone-releasing hormone in modulating sleep endocrine activity in the elderly.	aging	????-??-??	In aging, a decline in sleep continuity, a decreased slow wave sleep, an earlier nocturnal cortisol rise, and a blunted growth hormone (GH) secretion occur. Pulsatile administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in young controls enhanced slow wave sleep and suppressed cortisol release. We administered GHRH 4 x 50 microg or placebo i.v. to 13 healthy seniors (5 women, 8 men, mean age 69.3 y +/- 8.3 SD). We observed significantly reduced nocturnal awakenings and an increased first non-rapid-eye-movement sleep period. In a subgroup (n = 9), we found a significant activation of GH secretion but unchanged cortisol secretion. Our data underscore that GHRH is capable of promoting sleep in the elderly, but much less than in young subjects. Contrasting to young subjects, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system remains unaffected by GHRH in the elderly. These results provide further evidence that a decrease in the efficacy of GHRH is involved in the biological mechanisms underlying ag…
10561724	Chemotactic response of periodontal ligament cells decreases with donor age: association with reduced expression of c-fos.	aging	1999-10-??	OBJECTIVE: To understand the effects of aging on cellular motility of human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, and to determine the possible link between cell proliferation and migration in relation to cellular aging.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemotactic response of PDL cells from three juvenile and four older donors were compared. Then, migrated or unmigrated cells were examined for their cell cycle by morphological and immunocytochemical procedures. Finally, migrated or unmigrated cells were examined for the expression of c-fos and c-myc by in situhybridization.    RESULTS: PDL cells from older donors showed lower chemotaxis compared with the cells from juvenile donors (P < 0.05). Cells undergoing migration were found not to be in the S- or M-phase of the cell cycle. However, all migrated cells were found to express c-fos, while many of the cells which did not migrate were found not to express c-fos.    CONCLUSIONS: Cellular motility of PDL cells decreases with donor age as well …
28599356	An In Vitro Model for Fibroblast Photoaging Comparing Single and Repeated UVA Irradiations.	aging	2017-??-??	The current method for efficient evaluation of antiphotoaging compounds is an in vitro skin culture model using a single ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation of fibroblasts. However, skin photoaging is caused by repeated exposure to UVA radiation. The objective of this study was to develop an appropriate model for in vitro skin photoaging by comparing the different effects of single (5 J cm ) and repeated exposures (5 J cm × 3 times) of fibroblasts to UVA irradiation. Our results demonstrated that a single and repeated exposure to UVA irradiation had different effects on fibroblasts. In the single UVA-irradiated group, collagen lattice contraction and the protein levels of type I procollagen and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) increased, while the levels of fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were unchanged, compared to levels in the non-UVA-irradiated group (control). In contrast, repeated UVA exposure significantly induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, reduced collagen lattice…
18004746	Effect of growth hormone on in vitro osteogenesis and gene expression of human osteoblastic cells is donor-age-dependent.	aging	2008-05-15	It has been demonstrated that the effect of GH on bone tissue is reduced with aging. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the action of GH on osteoblastic cells is donor-age-dependent by investigating the effect of GH on the development of osteoblastic phenotype in cultures of cells from adolescents (13-16 years old), young adults (18-35 years old), and adults (36-49 years old). Osteoblastic cells derived from human alveolar bone were cultured with or without GH for periods of up to 21 days, and parameters of in vitro osteogenesis and gene expression of osteoblastic markers were evaluated. GH increased culture growth, collagen content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cultures from adolescents and young adults, whereas non-significant effect was observed in cultures from adults. While GH significantly increased the bone-like formation in cultures from adolescents, a slightly effect was observed in cultures from young adults and no alteration was detected in cultures fro…
7378595	The Woronets trait: a new familial erythrocyte anomaly.	lifespan	1980-??-??	A dominantly inherited abnormality of the red blood cells is described. It is characterized by the presence of a small population of markedly distorted red blood cells resembling keratocytes. In addition, many of the red cells show minor deformities resembling the beginning stages of formation of echinocytes. Red cell lifespan is normal, and the severely deformed cells appear to represent the senescent population. Inappropriate increases in activities of some, but not all, age-dependent red cell enzymes were observed. The anomaly appeared to be entirely benign; no abnormal clinical findings were associated with this defect. It has been designated the Woronets trait.
16957592	Decreased activation of anterior cingulate cortex in the working memory of the elderly.	aging	2006-10-02	We examined aging effects on activation in the anterior cingulate cortex during a verbal working memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten young (mean age 25 years) and 10 elderly (mean age 69 years) healthy adults performed the reading span test in which performance reflects individual differences in verbal working memory. We found an age-related difference in executive function in the prefrontal cortex; younger participants showed significant anterior cingulate cortex activation whereas the elderly did not. We found that the anterior cingulate cortex plays a critical role in executive function related to working memory. We found that behavioral deficits in verbal working memory because of aging result from the deterioration of cognitive control owing to decreased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex.
17828598	Age-related effects of regular physical activity on hemostatic factors in men.	aging	2008-12-??	BACKGROUND: Age-related changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolytic factors are associated with an increase in risk of thrombotic events. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of age, regular aerobic exercise and detraining on blood coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in men.    METHODS: Initially, 41 sedentary and 42 physically active men (20-64 years) were analyzed for plasma levels of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors. Twelve sedentary men were then subjected to 16-week aerobic exercise training and subsequent 2-week detraining. Their blood samples taken at rest were assayed for activity levels of prothrombin, coagulation factor (F) V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XIII, antithrombin III, protein C and plasminogen, and for antigen levels of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), FIX, protein C, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and tPA/PAI-1 complex.    RESULTS: Plasma levels of most coagulation factors, parti…
24078519	Site-dependent differences in density of sympathetic nerve fibers in muscle-innervating nerves of the human head and neck.	aging	2014-03-??	The autonomic nerve supply of skeletal muscle has become a focus of interest because it is closely related to the adaptation of energy metabolism with aging. We have performed an immunohistochemistry study on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) using specimens obtained from ten selected elderly cadavers (mean age 83.3 years) in which we examined muscle-innervating nerves (abbreviated ‘‘muscle-nerves’’ hereafter) of ten striated muscles (soleus, infraspinatus, extra-ocular inferior rectus, lateral rectus, superior obliquus, temporalis, orbicularis oculi, posterior cricoarytenoideus, trapezius and genioglossus) and, as a positive control, the submandibular ganglion. We found that the extra-ocular muscles received no or very few TH-positive nerve fibers. Muscle-nerves to the other head and neck muscles contained a few or several TH-positive fibers per section, but their density (proportional area of TH-positive fibers per nerve cross-section) was one-half t…
26587801	Decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes from individuals presenting Candida-associated denture stomatitis.	aging	2016-01-??	Candida-associated denture stomatitis (DS) is the most frequent lesion among denture wearers, especially the elderly. DS is strongly associated with Candida albicans, as well as local and systemic factors, such as impaired immune response. Monocytes are important in the protective immune response against the fungus by the production of cytokines that recruit and activate leukocytes. There are functional changes in these cells with age, and individual alterations involving monocyte response may predispose the host to developing infections by Candida spp. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the production of TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-1β, MCP-1 and IL-10 by monocytes from elderly denture wearers with/without DS and elderly or young non-denture wearers. We detected that monocytes from elderly denture wearers with Candida-related denture stomatitis produced lower levels of CXCL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1. This imbalance in cytokine levels was observed in spontaneous or LPS-stimulated production. The…
18511728	Gender and race/ethnicity differences in lead dose biomarkers.	aging	2008-07-??	OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify predictors of lead concentrations in the blood, tibias, and patellae of older adults and to describe differences by gender, race/ethnicity, and other factors that can influence lead toxicokinetics and, thus modify health effects.    METHODS: Participants aged 50 to 70 years (N=1140) were randomly identified from selected neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland. We measured lead concentrations by anodic stripping voltammetry (in blood) and (109)Cd-induced K-shell x-ray fluorescence (in bone). We used multiple linear regression to identify predictors of lead concentrations.    RESULTS: Mean (SD) lead concentrations in blood, tibias, and patellae were 3.5 (2.4) mug/dL, 18.9 (12.5) mug/g, and 6.8 (18.1) mug/g, respectively. Tibia concentrations were 29% higher in African Americans than in Whites (P < .01). We observed effect modification by race/ethnicity on the association of gender and physical activity to blood lead concentrations and by gender on the asso…
16424294	Aldosterone and telomere length in white blood cells.	aging	2005-12-??	BACKGROUND: Aldosterone accelerates cardiovascular aging by mechanisms that generate reactive oxygen species. Telomere length in white blood cells (WBCs) may be a bioindicator that registers the accruing burden of systemic oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to examine the relationship between plasma aldosterone and telomere length in WBCs.    METHODS: We studied 75 normotensive and never-treated mildly hypertensive men whose blood was drawn for the measurements of plasma aldosterone concentration and the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length in WBCs.    RESULTS: The slope of the TRF-age relationship in the entire cohort showed a decrease in telomere length of 26 +/- 5 base pairs per year (r = -0.46, p <.001). Age-adjusted TRF length was the longest in the lowest aldosterone quartile (6.74 +/- 0.12 kb) and shortest in the highest aldosterone quartile (6.36 +/- 0.11 kb), with intermediate TRF lengths in the second and third aldosterone quartiles (analysis…
15629860	Hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in normal human keratinocytes is differentiation dependent.	aging	2005-02-01	More than other tissues, skin is exposed to numerous external stresses generating ROS that, in addition to endogenous oxygen radicals, cause keratinocyte alterations and contribute in part to photocarcinogenesis and aging. Recent evidence suggests a differentiation-dependent susceptibility of keratinocytes to apoptosis. We explored hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in normal human keratinocytes according to their differentiation. On H(2)O(2)-exposed skin explants, caspase-3 was strongly activated in basal keratinocytes double stained with beta(1) integrin, whereas DNA fragmentation occurred in suprabasal cells only without caspase-3 activation. In addition, isolated basal keratinocytes, selected by adhesion to type IV collagen, were more sensitive than nonadherent cells to H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis with regard to mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(mt)) collapse and membrane integrity. Similarly, necrotic/late apoptotic cells were present at low levels only in the adher…
20688380	The requirement of zinc and calcium ions for functional MMP activity in demineralized dentin matrices.	aging	2010-11-??	UNLABELLED: The progressive degradation of resin-dentin bonds is due, in part, to the slow degradation of collagen fibrils in the hybrid layer by endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) of the dentin matrix. In in vitro durability studies, the storage medium composition might be important because the optimum activity of MMPs requires both zinc and calcium.    OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of different storage media on changes in matrix stiffness, loss of dry weight or solubilization of collagen from demineralized dentin beams incubated in vitro for up to 60 days.    METHODS: Dentin beams (1mm×2mm×6mm) were completely demineralized in 10% phosphoric acid. After baseline measurements of dry mass and elastic modulus (E) (3-point bending, 15% strain) the beams were divided into 5 groups (n=11/group) and incubated at 37°C in either media containing both zinc and calcium designated as complete medium (CM), calcium-free medium, zinc-free medium, a doubled-zinc medium or water…
18316138	Midlife C-reactive protein and risk of cognitive decline: a 31-year follow-up.	aging	2009-11-??	There is evidence for a relationship between raised inflammatory markers, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), measured late in life, and an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This study evaluates the association of midlife hs-CRP concentrations with late-life longitudinal trends in cognitive function. Data are from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS), a longitudinal community-based study of Japanese American men. hs-CRP levels were measured on average 25 years before cognitive testing began in 1991. Subjects were followed from up to three follow-up examinations (mean of 6.1 years). At each exam, cognitive function was measured with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). This analysis includes a sub-sample of 691 subjects dementia-free in 1991. With incident dementia cases included, those with the highest quartile of hs-CRP had significantly more cognitive decline than those in the lowest quartile, after adjustment for baseline CASI scor…
16418789	Effect of age-related chronic immobility on markers of bone turnover.	aging	2006-02-??	UNLABELLED: The effects of acute immobilization on bone turnover are well known, but the effects of chronic hypomobility with aging have not been studied. In a cohort of 1064 frail elderly subjects, immobility was significantly associated with serum PINP but not serum CTx after adjusting for confounders. The effect of immobility may be more marked on bone formation than on bone resorption.    INTRODUCTION: Accelerated bone turnover and rapid bone loss caused by acute immobilization is well recognized, but the effects of age-related chronic reduction in mobility on bone turnover have been less well studied. We assessed the associations between bone turnover and measures of mobility in a cohort of elderly subjects.    MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured serum levels of the aminoterminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), a marker of bone formation, and serum concentrations of the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), a marker of bone resorption, as well as serum intact …
28849910	In-Tip Lanthanum Oxide Monolith for the Enrichment of Phosphorylated Biomolecules.	aging	2017-??-03	Polymeric monoliths fabricated in tips with embedded materials of choice are important in separation science. Polymeric backbone however interferes in the enrichment and thus affects efficiency. This work focuses on the in-tip fabrication of lanthanum oxide porous monolith and its application in the enrichment of phosphorylated peptides and lipids. Polycondensation reaction uses an aqueous solution of LaCl·7HO with N-methyl formamide as porogen and propylene oxide as initiator. The aging time of monolith and temperature condition for the reaction are optimized to attain porous monolithic tip. A comparison of (i) solid phase batch extraction using LaO, (ii) LaO embedded in poly(glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)/divinylbenzene (DVB)) tip, and (iii) pure LaO monolithic tip shows improved enrichment efficiency in the case of pure LaO monolithic tip. The monolithic tip achieves selectivity of 1:4500 as compared to solid phase extraction (SPE)(1:3500) and limit of detection down to 0.25 fmol. The …
26748244	Retinoids and glucocorticoids have opposite effects on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in hippocampal HT22 cells.	aging	2016-02-??	A chronic excess of glucocorticoids elicits deleterious effects in the hippocampus. Conversely, retinoic acid plays a major role in aging brain plasticity. As synaptic plasticity depends on mechanisms related to cell morphology, we investigated the involvement of retinoic acid and glucocorticoids in the remodelling of the HT22 neurons actin cytoskeleton. Cells exhibited a significantly more elongated shape with retinoic acid and a rounder shape with dexamethasone; retinoic acid reversed the effects of dexamethasone. Actin expression and abundance were unchanged by retinoic acid or dexamethasone but F-actin organization was dramatically modified. Indeed, retinoic acid and dexamethasone increased (70 ± 7% and 176 ± 5%) cortical actin while retinoic acid suppressed the effect of dexamethasone (90 ± 6%). Retinoic acid decreased (-22 ± 9%) and dexamethasone increased (134 ± 16%) actin stress fibres. Retinoic acid also suppressed the effect of dexamethasone (-21 ± 7%). Spectrin is a key prot…
13449236	Immunologic studies of human high density lipoproteins.	aging	1957-08-01	High density serum lipoprotein underwent serologic and physicochemical alterations on aging during storage at 0 degrees C. for 1 month, as judged by decrease of diffusion coefficient and increase of C' fixation. Ultracentrifugation, dialysis, and high concentrations of sodium chloride did not cause these changes. A protein sedimenting at density 1.24 in the ultracentrifuge reacted with antiserum to high density lipoprotein. Probably it was the protein portion of alpha lipoprotein dissociated from the lipide during ultracentrifugation. Although the antiserum to high density lipoprotein did not react with low density lipoprotein prepared from normal serum, it reacted with similarly prepared lipoproteins from the serum of a patient with biliary cirrhosis.
25225480	Hyperandrogenism after menopause.	aging	2015-02-??	Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism is a state of relative or absolute androgen excess originating from either the adrenals and/or the ovaries, clinically manifested as the appearance and/or increase in terminal hair growth or the development of symptoms/signs of virilization. In either settings, physicians need to evaluate such patients and exclude the presence of the relatively rare but potentially life-threatening underlying tumorous causes, particularly adrenal androgen-secreting tumors. It has been suggested that the rapidity of onset along with severity of symptom and the degree of androgen excess followed by relevant imaging studies may suffice to identify the source of excessive androgen secretion. However, up to date, there is no consensus regarding specific clinical and hormonal indices and/or imaging modalities required for diagnostic certainty. This is particularly relevant as the aging population is increasing and more cases of postmenopausal women with clinical/biochemical ev…
10656502	Effects of postmenopausal hypoestrogenism on skin collagen.	aging	1999-12-15	OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of aging and postmenopausal hypoestrogenism on skin collagen content.    METHODS: Thirty-two women (mean age 48.78 +/- 9.86; year +/- S.D., range 28-68), 14 in premenopause and 18 in postmenopause, underwent skin biopsies performed during laparotomic operation. The amount of collagen type I, III and type III/type I ratio was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and computerised image analysis, and was related to age and years of postmenopause.    RESULTS: In the postmenopausal patients, a significant (P < 0.01) decrease of percentage of skin collagen type I, type III and type III/type I ratio was observed in comparison to premenopausal women. The percentages of collagen type I, type III and type III/I ratio of all patients studied was significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with chronological age (r = 0.88, 0.89 and 0.61, respectively). Considering only postmenopausal subjects, the correlation with chronological age was significant (P…
20147655	Longitudinal cognitive decline is associated with fibrillar amyloid-beta measured by [11C]PiB.	aging	2010-03-09	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether longitudinal declines in cognition are associated with higher fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in vivo in individuals without dementia.    METHOD: [(11)C]PiB images were obtained to measure fibrillar Abeta burden in 57 participants without dementia from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants (33 men, 24 women) had a mean (SD) age of 78.7 (6.2) years. Six participants (4 men, 2 women) had mild cognitive impairment defined as Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. To measure [(11)C]PiB retention, distribution volume ratios (DVR) for 15 regions of interest were estimated by fitting a simplified reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves. Mixed effects regression was used to predict cognitive trajectories over time using data before and including time of PiB (mean follow-up 10.8 years), with mean cortical DVR, age at baseline, sex, and education as independent predictors. Voxel-based analysis identified local association…
21248468	Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci are dispensable for cellular senescence, occur in a cell type- and insult-dependent manner and follow expression of p16(ink4a).	aging	2011-02-01	Cellular senescence, an irreversible proliferation arrest evoked by stresses such as oncogene activation, telomere dysfunction, or diverse genotoxic insults, has been implicated in tumor suppression and aging. Primary human fibroblasts undergoing oncogene-induced or replicative senescence are known to form senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), nuclear DNA domains stained densely by DAPI and enriched for histone modifications including lysine9-trimethylated histone H3. While cellular senescence occurs also in premalignant human lesions, it is unclear how universal is SAHF formation among various cell types, under diverse stresses, and whether SAHF occur in vivo. Here, we report that human primary fibroblasts (BJ and MRC-5) and primary keratinocytes undergoing replicative senescence, or premature senescence induced by oncogenic H-Ras, diverse chemotherapeutics and bacterial cytolethal distending toxin, show differential capacity to form SAHF. Whereas all tested cell types fo…
3839765	Red cell NADH diaphorase variants in Japanese.	aging	1985-??-??	Human red cell NADH diaphorase isozyme patterns were examined in 5,046 healthy adult Japanese by starch gel electrophoresis. Twenty had Dia 2-1 and 3 had Dia 4-1 phenotypes. The incidence of Dia variants in patients with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and Down's syndrome was also examined and compared with that of healthy people. It was noticed that thin-layer isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel was very useful for discriminating variant bands from 'aging bands'.
9878530	Degradation of gamma D- and gamma s-crystallins in human lenses.	aging	1998-12-18	The aim of this study was to determine age-related degradation of gammaD-crystallin and the cleavage sites in the connecting peptide regions of the two domains of gammaD- and gammas-crystallins. The water-soluble (WS) proteins from lenses of donors of different ages and a purified gamma-crystallin fraction were analyzed for the fragments of gammaD-crystallin by the Western blot method. Four site-specific antibodies (Ab) raised to the four regions of human gammaD-crystallin, i.e., anti-gammaD-N-Ab to the N-terminal end (residue nos. 1-9), anti-gammaD-C-Ab to the C-terminal end (residue nos. 165-173), and two to the middle regions, anti-gammaD-M1 Ab (residue nos. 78-86) and anti-gammaD-M2 Ab (residue nos. 87-95), were used. The gamma-crystallin fragments were also separated by a preparative SDS-PAGE method prior to Western blot analysis. The two-dimensional gel electrophoretic method (first dimension of isoelectric focusing followed by the second dimension of SDS-PAGE) was used to separa…
25409511	A computational model incorporating neural stem cell dynamics reproduces glioma incidence across the lifespan in the human population.	lifespan, aging	2014-??-??	Glioma is the most common form of primary brain tumor. Demographically, the risk of occurrence increases until old age. Here we present a novel computational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the lifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are framed in a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To decrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate recent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since evidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem cell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our model. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual demographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age, wi…
7375858	Platelet heterogeneity: relevance to the use of platelets to study psychiatric disorders.	aging	1980-??-??	Laboratory workers in fields outside of hematology have shown increased interest in the platelet as an investigative model over the past decade. Simultaneously, primary knowledge about platelet biology has expanded rapidly. It is now clear that many of the platelet's specific properties may influence the collection and interpretation of platelet-related, experimental data. or example, platelet heterogeneity, with respect to physical and function character exerts a significant impact on platelet-related experiments. This report highlights some of the recent advances in the area, with specific emphasis on the area of platelet aging and its effect on the use of platelets as an investigative tool.
11940458	Sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes of shoe factory workers exposed to solvents.	aging	2002-04-??	We examined sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronuclei (MN; cytokinesis-block method) in cultured peripheral lymphocytes from 52 female workers of two shoe factories and from 36 unexposed age- and sex-matched referents. The factory workers showed an elevated level of urinary hippuric acid, a biomarker of toluene exposure, and workplace air contained high concentrations of various organic solvents such as toluene, gasoline, acetone, and (in one of the plants only) ethylacetate and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. The shoe factory workers showed a statistically significant higher frequency of micronucleated binucleate lymphocytes in comparison with the referents. This finding agreed with three preliminary MN determinations (each comprising 27-32 shoe workers and 16-20 controls) performed in one of the plants 2-5 years earlier. The shoe factory workers also had a lower average level of blood hemoglobin than the referents. In contrast, no difference was found between the groups in SC…
18978637	Atypical estradiol secretion and ovulation patterns caused by luteal out-of-phase (LOOP) events underlying irregular ovulatory menstrual cycles in the menopausal transition.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: The menopausal transition is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and unpredictable hormone levels, including dramatic swings in estradiol (E2). An increasing number of studies have found variable high E2 and low luteal phase progesterone occur with progression of Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW)stage, but the cause remains unclear. To explore the causes of the erratic changes in E2, individual within-cycle secretion patterns of E2, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, inhibin A, and inhibin B were explored in detail.    DESIGN: Blood samples taken three times per week over 1 1/3 menstrual cycles from 77 women aged 21 to 55 classified as mid-reproductive age (STRAW stages 5 and 4; n = 21), late-reproductive age (STRAW stages 4 and 3; n = 16), early menopausal transition (STRAW stage 2; n = 17), and late menopausal transition (STRAW stage 1; n = 23) were analyzed.    RESULTS: Eleven of the 29 (37%) early and late menstrual trans…
23259507	Substantial and reversible brain gray matter reduction but no acute brain lesions in ultramarathon runners: experience from the TransEurope-FootRace Project.	aging	2012-12-21	BACKGROUND: During the extremely challenging 4,487 km ultramarathon TransEurope-FootRace 2009, runners showed considerable reduction of body weight. The effects of this endurance run on brain volume changes but also possible formation of brain edema or new lesions were explored by repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.    METHODS: A total of 15 runners signed an informed consent to participate in this study of planned brain scans before, twice during, and about 8 months after the race. Because of dropouts, global gray matter volume analysis could only be performed in ten runners covering three timepoints, and in seven runners who also had a follow-up scan. Scanning was performed on three identical 1.5 T Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto scanners, two of them located at our university. The third MRI scanner with identical sequence parameters was a mobile MRI unit escorting the runners. Volumetric 3D datasets were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo …
16399218	Novel fearful faces activate the amygdala in healthy young and elderly adults.	aging	2006-02-??	Activation of the amygdala to emotionally valenced stimuli, and particularly to fearful faces, has been widely demonstrated in healthy young adults. However, recent studies assessing amygdala responses to fearful emotional faces in the normal elderly have not shown similar results. The reason for this is uncertain, but it may relate to life-span developmental changes in processing emotional stimuli or structural alterations in the amygdala with aging. In order to examine whether the amygdala could be activated in the elderly, we developed a paradigm designed to engage the amygdala on several levels. Based on recent imaging work indicating that novelty and stimulus change activates the amygdala, we assessed amygdala responses in young and elderly adults to novel fearful faces (versus familiar neutral ones). We demonstrate a robust activation in both groups, indicating that the amygdala remains responsive in aging. This activation did not differ between the two groups when we examined re…
7308747	The effects of psychosocial stress on urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline in 51- to 55- and 71- to 74-year-old men.	aging	1981-??-??	The experiments were done to investigate modifications with aging in reactivity and speed of recovery of the sympathetic adrenomedullary system during psychosocial stress. Normal male volunteers were studied. Urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline, diuresis, pH and specific gravity were measured. Adrenaline and noradrenaline baseline levels were lower in the older age group. Adrenaline levels increased by the same percent during stress in the two age groups, but came back to pre-stress values more slowly in older subjects, as did blood pressure.
21505241	Cloning, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the human histone deacetylase sirtuin 1.	aging	2011-04-01	Human sirtuin 1 is a member of the histone deacetylase family and is involved in cellular aging, tumourigenesis and cellular metabolism. Recombinant sirtuin 1 comprising residues 140-747 was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystal diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution and belonged to space group P622, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 203.1, c = 625.3 Å, and is estimated to contain between six and 12 molecules per asymmetric unit.
719890	Serum lipid peroxide in cerebrovascular disorders determined by a new colorimetric method.	aging	1978-11-15	A new colorimetric method for quantitative analysis of serum lipid peroxide, free of interference from sialic acids, has been developed. We have used the thiobarbituric acid dissolved in sodium sulfate solution and both liberation of lipid peroxide and color reaction have been performed simultaneously by heating serum protein precipitate with this reagent in a weak acid solution. The new method is specific and facilitates the precise measurements of serum lipid peroxide. The average values determined by the new method increased slightly with age in healthy subjects. In patients with sequelae of cerebrovascular disorders, serum lipid peroxide values were higher than in healthy controls. These results may demonstrate the important role of lipid peroxide in aging and cerebrovascular disorders.
19528829	Bone lead and endogenous exposure in an environmentally exposed elderly population: the normative aging study.	aging	2009-07-??	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the mobilization of lead from bone to blood (endogenous exposure) in a large epidemiologic population.    METHODS: Study subjects were 776 participants in the Normative Aging Study. The subjects had their tibia lead, patella lead, blood lead, and urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) levels measured 1 to 4 times from 1991 to 2002. Regression models were estimated to quantify the association between tibia and patella lead and blood lead. We studied nonlinearity of the association, and explored possible factors that may modify it, including age and NTx levels.    RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is significant association between bone lead and blood lead, and the association is nonlinear. The nonlinear associations between blood lead and bone lead are not significantly modified by age and NTx.
7198044	Intrauterine growth retardation. A report of two cases with bird-headed appearance, skeletal changes and peripheral GH resistance.	aging	1981-10-??	Two cases of severe intrauterine growth retardation, a boy and a girl studied for 7 and 10 years respectively, are reported. Both patients showed peculiar cranio-facial abnormalities as observed in the so-called Seckel's syndrome, an appearance of premature aging, peripheral GH resistance which was probably due to deficiency in Somatomedin A production, sella areas and volumes consistently at the upper limits of normal when related to the patients' height, and dysharmonic skeletal maturation ivory cone-shaped epiphyses of the tubular bones of the hands.
21098973	Cerebrospinal fluid tau in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: clinical, neuroimaging, and prognostic correlates.	aging	2011-??-??	Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to heterogeneous clinical and biological conditions. In FTLD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels have been reported highly variable. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether CSF tau might be the hallmark of a distinct FTLD phenotype. Fifty-five FTLD patients, who underwent CSF analysis, were considered in the present study. In each patient, a wide standardized neuropsychological evaluation, and CSF tau, phospho-tau, and amyloid-β (Aβ) dosages were performed. Each patient was followed-up to five years, and outcomes carefully recorded. In a subgroup of patients (n = 24), magnetic resonance imaging scanning was performed, by using voxel-based morphometry, for grey matter investigation. The higher the CSF tau levels, the worse the neuropsychological and neuroimaging pattern, mainly characterized by greater language disturbances and left temporal grey matter loss. The same pattern, even if less significant, was associated with CS…
18795167	Association between 24-hour urinary cadmium and pulmonary function among community-exposed men: the VA Normative Aging Study.	aging	2008-09-??	BACKGROUND: High levels of cadmium exposure are known to cause emphysema in occupationally exposed workers, but little has been reported to date on the association between chronic environmental cadmium exposure and pulmonary function.    OBJECTIVE: In this study we examined the association between pulmonary function and cadmium body burden in a subcohort of the Normative Aging Study, a community-based study of aging.    METHODS: We examined 96 men who had cadmium measured in single 24-hr urinary specimens collected in 1994-1995 and who had one to three tests of pulmonary function between 1994 and 2002 (a total of 222 observations). We used mixed-effect models to predict pulmonary function based on individual 24-hr urinary cadmium output, adjusted for age, height, time elapsed from the baseline, and smoking status. We assessed effect modification by smoking status.    RESULTS: Among all subjects, a single log-unit increase in baseline urinary cadmium was inversely associated with forced…
17424933	Structure activity relationship of antioxidative property of flavonoids and inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase activity in UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblast.	aging	2007-03-??	Collagenase, a matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is a key regulator in the photoaging process of skin due to the reactive oxygen species generated after exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA). Flavonoid compounds have been demonstrated to possess antioxidant properties, and could be useful in the prevention of photoaging. In this study, to investigate the structure-activity relationship of flavonoid compounds on their antioxidant property and inhibitory effects against the MMP activity, the effects of several flavonoids; myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, apigenin and chrysin, on the reactive oxygen species scavengering activity and inhibitory effect against the MMP activity were examined in vitro and in human dermal fibroblasts induced by UVA. The relative order of antioxidative efficacy, as determined using the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method and the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, was as follows; flavones: luteolin > apigenin > chrysin, flavonols: myricetin > querce…
25130720	Canalicular network morphology is the major determinant of the spatial distribution of mass density in human bone tissue: evidence by means of synchrotron radiation phase-contrast nano-CT.	aging	2015-02-??	In bone remodeling, maturation of the newly formed osteonal tissue is associated with a rapid primary increase followed by a slower secondary increase of mineralization. This requires supply and precipitation of mineral into the bone matrix. Mineral delivery can occur only from the extracellular fluid via interfaces such as the Haversian system and the osteocyte pore network. We hypothesized that in mineralization, mineral exchange is achieved by the diffusion of mineral from the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) to the bone matrix, resulting in a gradual change in tissue mineralization with respect to the distance from the pore-matrix interface. We expected to observe alterations in the mass density distribution with tissue age. We further hypothesized that mineral exchange occurs not only at the lacunar but also at the canalicular boundaries. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the spatial distribution of mass density in the perilacunar and pericanalicular bone matri…
23564190	Spaceflight-induced bone loss: is there an osteoporosis risk?	aging	2013-06-??	Currently, the measurement of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is used at NASA to evaluate the effects of spaceflight on the skeletal health of astronauts. Notably, there are precipitous declines in aBMD with losses >10 % detected in the hip and spine in some astronauts following a typical 6-month mission in space. How those percentage changes in aBMD relate to fracture risk in the younger-aged astronaut is unknown. Given the unique set of risk factors that could be contributing to this bone loss (eg, adaptation to weightlessness, suboptimal diet, reduced physical activity, perturbed mineral metabolism), one might not expect skeletal changes due to spaceflight to be similar to skeletal changes due to aging. Consequently, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement of aBMD may be too limiting to understand fracture probability in the astronaut during a long-duration mission and the risk for premature osteoporosis after return to Earth. Following a brief review of the current kno…
26815911	Expression and functional roles of estrogen receptor GPR30 in human intervertebral disc.	aging	2016-04-??	Estrogen withdrawal, a characteristic of female aging, is associated with age-related intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The function of estrogen is mediated by two classic nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β, and a membrane bound G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). To date, the expression and function of GPR30 in human spine is poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate GPR30 expression in IVD, and its role in estrogen-related regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of disc nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. GPR30 expression was examined in 30 human adult NP and 9 fetal IVD. Results showed that GPR30 was expressed in NP cells at both mRNA and protein levels. In human fetal IVD, GPR30 protein was expressed in the NP at 12-14 weeks gestation, but was undetectable at 8-11 weeks. The effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on GPR30-mediated proliferation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced apoptosis of NP cells was investigated. Cultured NP cells were treated with or without E…
25196100	The role of sex and sex-related hormones in cognition, mood and well-being in older men and women.	aging	2014-12-??	Alterations in hormone levels during aging impact on cognition and mood. Serum concentration levels of testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and prolactin (PRL) were assessed in 120 community-dwellers (51+ years of age, males and females), in a cross-sectional approach. Performance clusters based on executive functioning (GENEXEC), memory (MEM), mood and well-being were obtained. In males, higher PRL levels associated with worse cognitive performance, lower well-being, and higher scores in depression scales, and lower E2 with poorer cognition and higher depressive mood. DHEAS positively associated with GENEXEC and MEM. Nutritional status significantly associated with PRL (positively) and with DHEAS (negatively). Findings indicate that besides the more exhaustively studied E2 and TT, variations in the levels of sex-related hormones such as PRL, FSH, LH and DHEAS are of interest for the ment…
16201977	Serum total and free testosterone level of Japanese men: a population-based study.	aging	2005-09-??	BACKGROUND: There has never been a large scale population-based study of serum levels of total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT) in Japanese men.    METHODS: We determined serum levels of TT and FT of 1120 Japanese men aged 40-79 years using radioimmunoassay (RIA), as a part of a population-based longitudinal study of aging. Of these, sex hormone binding protein (SHBG) was also measured by RIA in 471 men. For the latter group, the calculated free testosterone (cFT) was determined by a formula using serum level of albumin, TT and SHBG.    RESULTS: The mean +/- 2 SD of TT, FT and cFT were 513 +/- 326 ng/dL (187-839 ng/dL), 13.2 +/- 7.8) pg/mL (5.4-21.0 pg/mL) and 77.0 +/- 43.4 pg/mL (33.6-120.4 pg/mL), respectively. While TT did not relate to age, FT and cFT decreased with age. FT in the 40-49 years age group was 15.1 +/- 8.4 pg/mL (6.7-23.5 pg/mL), in the 50-59 years age group was 13.9 +/- 6.8 pg/mL (7.1-20.7 pg/mL), in the 60-69 years age group was 12.0 +/- 6.6 pg/mL (5.4-18…
23843935	Posttraumatic stress disorder and not depression is associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length: findings from 3,000 participants in the population-based KORA F4 study.	aging	2013-??-??	BACKGROUND: A link between severe mental stress and shorter telomere length (TL) has been suggested. We analysed the impact of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on TL in the general population and postulated a dose-dependent TL association in subjects suffering from partial PTSD compared to full PTSD.    METHODS: Data are derived from the population-based KORA F4 study (2006-2008), located in southern Germany including 3,000 individuals (1,449 men and 1,551 women) with valid and complete TL data. Leukocyte TL was measured using a quantitative PCR-based technique. PTSD was assessed in a structured interview and by applying the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). A total of 262 (8.7%) subjects qualified for having partial PTSD and 51 (1.7%) for full PTSD. To assess the association of PTSD with the average TL, linear regression analyses with adjustments for potential confounding factors were performed.    RESULTS: The multiple model revealed a sign…
18025809	Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and mortality in frail, community-living elderly.	longevity, aging	2008-??-??	BACKGROUND: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol has been hypothesized to be a reliable marker of frailty and poor prognosis among the oldest elderly.    OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluate the impact of HDL cholesterol on the risk of all-cause mortality in a large population of frail octogenarians and nonagenarians living in a community.    METHODS: We analyzed data from the Aging and Longevity Study in the Sirente geographic area (ilSIRENTE Study), a prospective cohort study that collected data on all subjects aged 80 year and older living in a mountain community (n = 359). The main outcome measure was the relative hazard ratio of death after 2 years of follow-up for different levels of HDL cholesterol.    RESULTS: A total of 86 deaths (30 men and 56 women) occurred during 2 years of follow-up. Among men the mean HDL cholesterol level was 36.7 +/- 7.6 mg/dl among those who died as compared with 43.4 +/- 10.3 mg/dl among survivors (p = 0.001). Similarly, among women, th…
2184196	Human chorionic gonadotropin detection by means of enzyme immunoassay: a useful method in forensic pregnancy diagnosis in bloodstains.	aging	1990-03-??	This paper reports on human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) detection in bloodstains using a commercial kit based on enzyme immunoassay. The specificity and sensitivity of the method is tested, as well as HCG stability over time in the samples. Detection of this hormone in bloodstains is of special interest for pregnancy diagnosis in forensic science applications. The experimental series comprises 60 bloodstains prepared in our laboratory and obtained from blood samples taken from 30 pregnant women and 30 healthy, nonpregnant individuals. The bloodstains were studied at different stages of aging over a 6-month period, each sample being stored at 2 different temperatures throughout the process. The experimental evidence proves HCG to be a useful and stable diagnostic indicator of pregnancy in bloodstains. In addition, the technique used is fast, as well as highly sensitive and specific.
18486388	Independent component model of the default-mode brain function: combining individual-level and population-level analyses in resting-state fMRI.	aging	2008-09-??	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is a technique used to investigate the spontaneous correlations of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals across different regions of the brain. Using functional connectivity tools, it is possible to investigate a specific RS-fMRI network, referred to as "default-mode" (DM) network, that involves cortical regions deactivated in fMRI experiments with cognitive tasks. Previous works have reported a significant effect of aging on DM regions activity. Independent component analysis (ICA) is often used for generating spatially distributed DM functional connectivity patterns from RS-fMRI data without the need for a reference region. This aspect and the relatively easy setup of an RS-fMRI experiment even in clinical trials have boosted the combined use of RS-fMRI and ICA-based DM analysis for noninvasive research of brain disorders. In this work, we considered different strategies for combining ICA results from individual-level and p…
20643702	Comparisons of plasma/serum micronutrients between Okinawan and Oregonian elders: a pilot study.	aging	2010-10-??	Certain micronutrients are protective against cognitive decline. We examined whether there is any uniform pattern of circulating micronutrients cross-culturally that are associated with successful cognitive aging. For the U.S. sample, we used the stored serum/plasma of 115 participants, collected in Oregon, USA. The Okinawa sample consisted of 49 participants selected using similar inclusion criteria as the Oregon sample, from the Keys to Optimal Cognitive Aging Project. All participants were aged 85 years and older without cognitive impairment. We found that the Okinawan elders used fewer vitamin supplements but had similar levels of vitamin B(12) and α-tocopherol, lower folate and γ-tocopherol, compared with Oregonian elders. That is, we did not find a uniform pattern of circulating micronutrients, suggesting that micronutrients other than those examined here or other lifestyle factors than nutrition could play an important role in achieving successful cognitive aging.
2472131	The problem of hemoglobin switching in premature infants and IUGR infants.	aging	1989-03-??	Understanding the hemoglobin switching regulation mechanism in extremely premature infants is particularly important for understanding the extrauterine adaptation of the infants. In this study, we sought to identify factors influencing oxygen affinity in fetal blood and neonatal blood and obtained these results. (1) Aging is required for hemoglobin switching. (2) Switching in premature infants (27 to 32 weeks) is delayed at least 3 weeks in comparison with full-term infants. (3) A delay in the switching of fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin was confirmed in IUGR (intrauterine growth retardation) infants. However, there is a compensatory increase in 2, 3-DPG for adaptation after birth. (4) A delay in 2, 3-DPG increase was observed in RDS (respiratory distress syndrome) infants, and oxygen affinity remained high.
26603336	A prospective study of leukocyte telomere length and risk of phobic anxiety among women.	aging	2015-12-15	We prospectively examined the relation of relative telomere lengths (RTLs), a marker of biological aging, to phobic anxiety in later-life. RTLs in peripheral blood leukocytes were measured among 3194 women in the Nurses' Health Study who provided blood samples in 1989/90. The Crown-Crisp Phobic Index (CCI, range=0–16) was assessed in 1988 and 2004. Only participants with CCI≤3 (consistent with no meaningful anxiety symptoms) in 1988 were included. We related baseline RTLs to odds ratios (ORs) of incident high phobic anxiety symptoms (CCI≥6). To enhance clinical relevance, we used finite mixture modeling (FMM) to relate baseline RTLs to latent classes of CCI in 2004. RTLs were not significantly associated with high phobic anxiety symptoms after 16 years of follow-up. However, FMM identified 3 groups of phobic symptoms in later-life: severe, minimal/intermediate, and non-anxious. The severe group had non-significantly shorter multivariable-adjusted mean RTLs than the minimal/intermediate…
1893220	Thymic peptides, stress, and depressive symptoms in older men: a comparison of different statistical techniques for small samples.	aging	1991-06-??	Thymic peptides play an important role in aging and immune regulation, but little is known about their relationship to psychosocial factors. One thymic fraction, thymosin-alpha 1 (TSN-alpha 1) may be of particular interest given its hypothesized role in the differentiation of immature T cells into functional, mature T cells. We examined the relationships among stress, psychological symptoms, and TSN-alpha 1 levels in two conditions; before and after a glucose challenge test. The sample consisted of 18 men, aged 48-80, participants in the Normative Aging Study. While none of the correlations reached significance in the baseline condition, life events and depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with TSN-alpha 1 in the postchallenge condition (r's = .57, and .62, respectively). Hierarchical regression analyses with cross-product interaction terms suggested that individuals who were high in both life events and depression showed the highest levels of postchallenge TSN-alpha 1, wi…
25112958	Stereospecific hydrolysis of a phosphoramidate used as an OPIDP model by human sera with PON1 192 alloforms.	aging	2015-10-??	O-hexyl 2,5-dichlorophenyl phosphoramidate (HDCP) is a racemic organophosphate compound (OP) that induces delayed neuropathy in vivo. The O-hexyl 2,5-dichlorophenyl phosphoramidate R (R-HDCP) isomer inhibits and ages neuropathic target esterase (NTE) in hen brain. Moreover, human serum paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is a Ca(2+)-dependent enzyme capable of hydrolyzing OPs. The enzymatic activity of PON1 against OPs depends on the genetic polymorphisms present at position 192 (glutamine or arginine). The catalytic efficiency of PON1 is an important factor that determines neurotoxic susceptibility to some OPs. In the present study, we characterized the stereospecific hydrolysis of HDCP by alloforms PON1 Q192R human serum by chiral chromatography. Forty-seven human samples were characterized for the PON1 192 polymorphism. The hydrolysis data demonstrate that the three alloforms of PON1 show an exclusive and significant stereospecific Ca(2+)-dependent hydrolysis of O-hexyl 2,5-dichlorophenyl phosphor…
15682422	Predictive risk factors and prevalence of malignancy in patients with iron deficiency anemia in Taiwan.	aging	2005-02-??	Gastrointestinal (GI) tract malignancy is one of the important causes of chronic iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The present study was designed to find out the prevalence and the predictive risk factors of malignancy in the IDA patients. We performed a prospective study in 148 patients with chronic IDA. A series of examinations to explore the GI tract were performed either by radiology and/or endoscopy. A Tc-RBC GI bleeding study was also performed, and prevalence and risk factors of malignancy were calculated. Totally 148 patients were enrolled, with mean age 66.2 years; 88 were male. Eighteen patients (12.2%) were found to have malignant tumors. Ten (6.8%) had benign tumors, and 96 (64.9%) had other benign conditions. No lesions could be detected in 24 patients (16.2%). Clinical symptoms and presence of fecal occult blood could not predict malignancy or any GI lesions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed serum ferritin < or =10 microg/L, LDH >250 U/L, and aging as the risk…
40322	Age-dependent variations of lysosomal enzymes in human liver.	aging	1979-09-??	The specific activities, the Km values, and the elution patterns on DEAE 52 and Sephadex G-150 columns of six lysosomal enzymes in human liver during development were studied. The levels of total beta-D-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activities in childhood liver were higher than those in fetal liver. The Km values of beta-D-glucuronidase and beta-D-galactosidase in fetal liver were about ten times higher than those in childhood liver. The elution patterns on DEAE 52 of beta-D-glucuronidase and on Sephadex G-150 of alpha-D- and beta-D-galactosidases changed with aging. It is suggested that lysosomal enzymes related to degradation of gangliosides and glycosaminoglycans change during development.
304810	In vitro characteristics of childhood leukemic monoblasts.	aging	1978-01-??	Leukemic monoblasts obtained from three children were evaluated for their in vitro physiologic characteristics. These monoblasts were alpha naphthyl acetate esterase positive, exhibited glass adherence, had IgG membrane receptors, phagocytized latex particles with subsequent nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, and matured to macrophages in vitro, either when adherent to glass slides or in feeder layer suspensions. Employing the double layer in vitro bone marrow culture technique, leukemic marrows from these children failed to produce colonies in culture in the presence or absence of normal feeder layers. Varying the concentration of leukemic cells in the feeder layers failed to augment colony growth from normal bone marrows. Although monoblasts were observed to mature to macrophages in vitro, no increase in colony stimulating factor activity was observed with aging of the feeder layers. These studies suggest that childhood leukemic monoblasts lack the ability to produce colony stimu…
27094339	Peripheral inflammation related to lower fMRI activation during a working memory task and resting functional connectivity among older adults: a preliminary study.	aging	2017-03-??	OBJECTIVE: Peripheral inflammation has been associated with adverse effects on cognition and brain structure in late life, a process called 'inflammaging.' Identifying biomarkers of preclinical cognitive decline is critical in the development of preventative therapies, and peripheral inflammation may be able to serve as an indicator of cognitive decline. However, little is known regarding the relationship between peripheral inflammation and brain structure and function among older adults.    METHODS: Twenty-four older adults (mean age = 78) underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state functional connectivity scan, and a subset (n = 14) completed the n-Back working memory task in the scanner. All participants completed a blood draw, and inflammation was measured with interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP).    RESULTS: Surprisingly, age was unrelated to measures of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) or brain function (default mode network (DMN) connectivity; wo…
26255281	Incremental effects of 28 days of beta-alanine supplementation on high-intensity cycling performance and blood lactate in masters female cyclists.	aging	2015-12-??	Within the aging population, there exists a subset of individuals termed masters athletes (MA). As masters-level competition increases in popularity, MA must find methods to enhance individual athletic performance. Longitudinal beta-alanine (BA) supplementation is suggested to enhance physical capability during exercise; however, these effects have not been evaluated in MA. To examine the longitudinal effects of BA on time to exhaustion (TTE), total work completed (TWC), and lactate clearance in female MA cyclists. Twenty-two female MA (age = 53.3 ± 1.0) participated in this double-blind design. Subjects were randomly assigned to BA (n = 11; 800 mg BA + 8 g dextrose) or placebo (PLA; n = 11; 8 g dextrose) groups and supplemented 4 doses/day over 28 days. Every 7 days, subjects completed a cycling TTE at 120% VO2max, and TWC was calculated. Blood lactate was measured at baseline, immediate post, and 20-min post each TTE. No significant differences existed between groups for any variable…
30617361	Single cell analysis of aged RBCs: quantitative analysis of the aged cells and byproducts.	aging	2019-01-28	This study initially focused on characterizing the aging process of red blood cells by correlating the loss of hemoglobin and the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) in expired human red blood cells, hRBCs. Five pre-storage, leukoreduced hRBC units in AS-5 solution were stored between 1 and 6 °C for 42 days. Aliquots from each of these units were stained with Annexin-V FLUOS, which binds to externalized PS, and the hemoglobin within the cells was placed in a methemoglobin state with sodium nitrite, metHb. These aliquots were subsequently sorted into four sub-populations, ranging from no PS expression to high PS expression using a BD FACS ARIAIII. Each of these sub-fractions were introduced into the cell tracking velocimetry apparatus which measured both the magnetically-induced and the gravity-induced velocity. Subsequently, the samples were removed from the cell tracking velocimetry instrument and characterized using the Multisizer 4e Coulter Counter. From the magnetically-induce…
10536645	Life stress, mood disturbance, and elevated interleukin-6 in healthy older women.	aging	1999-09-??	BACKGROUND: Although adverse effects of severe chronic stress on immunocompetence and physical well-being in older adults have been reported, the immune response to less severe life stress among healthy older adults, particularly among women, is not well understood. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been considered a good overall indicator of immune functioning in older adults because of its contribution to the pathogenesis of several age-related conditions such as osteoporosis. Regulation of IL-6 is impaired in elderly adults, and levels of IL-6 increase with stress and depression. This research cross-sectionally examined levels of IL-6 in three groups of healthy older women with varying levels of life stress and mood disturbance and a healthy group of young women.    METHODS: Subjects included 18 caregivers of Alzheimer's patients, 17 older women assessed one month before relocation of their residence, 15 nonmoving and noncaregiving older women, and 20 younger women. Subjects completed the Pr…
635432	Cortisol circadian rhythm in 70--100-year-old subjects.	aging	????-??-??	The circadian rhythms of plasma cortisol was examined in 25 persons aged between 70 and 100 years by comparison with 5 adults aged between 17 and 38 years. The blood samples were drawn at 16 hundred, 20 hundred, 00 hundred, 04 hundred and 08 hundred hrs. Cortisol was assayed by the fluorimetric method. The experimental data were analyzed by Halberg's mean-cosinor method. The results showed that the circadian rhythm in plasma cortisol changes with age. The characteristic phenomena found were the following: a tendency towards reducing the hourly quantitative differences, comparatively more marked between 90 and 100 years; anticipation of the cortisol maximum level of 08 hundred at 04 hundred hrs in the group of 71 to 80 years, and at 00 hundred hrs in some of the subjects older than 80. A normal circadian rhythm was found in 2 of the 25 cases examined. These changes imply variations of the same kind in the CRF and ACTH levels. The changes in the circadian rhythms of cortisol show that th…
15130673	Autolysosomes accumulate during in vitro CD8+ T-lymphocyte aging and may participate in induced death sensitization of senescent cells.	aging	2004-05-??	As autophagic inclusions accumulate in senescent fibroblasts, we wondered whether an increase in cellular fragility during in vitro lymphocyte aging may be related to an autolysosome accumulation. We established that, during long-term cultures, repeatedly stimulated T-lymphocytes acquired characteristics of replicative senescence and became progressively intolerant to activation. Cell death following stimulations: (i) corresponded to apoptosis, associated with necrosis at the end of the culture; (ii) was not, for its main part, mediated through CD95/CD178 or TNFRII/TNF alpha interactions; and (iii) occurred in spite of bcl-2 increased expression. After 14 weeks of culture, the percentage of lymphocytes containing at least one autophagic inclusion (p<0.0001) and the lipofuscin autofluorescence in lymphocytes (p<0.0001) were significantly increased. The expression of several genes regulating autophagy did not significantly vary with the age of the culture. Forty-eight hours after each st…
3201941	Evaluation of factors affecting sensory neural hearing loss.	aging	1988-??-??	A detailed analysis of risk factors in the development of sensory-neural hearing loss (SNHL) was carried out in 199 forest workers. The mean hearing threshold of both ears at 4000 Hz was measured and the effect of age, exposure, blood pressure, presence of vibration induced white finger (VWF), tobacco smoking and plasma lipid concentrations on SNHL were evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis. A part of aging the major risk factors were presence of VWF, elevation of LDL-cholesterol level and usage of antihypertensive agents. Additional factors in the analysis, e.g. smoking and diastolic and systolic blood pressure did not significantly contribute to the genesis of SNHL.
23690311	Thyroid hormones are associated with cognitive function: moderation by sex, race, and depressive symptoms.	aging	2013-08-??	CONTEXT: Recent evidence indicates that thyroid hormones may be closely linked to cognition among adults.    OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations between thyroid hormones and cognitive performance, while testing effect modification by sex, race, and elevated depressive symptoms (EDS).    DESIGN: This cross-sectional study used extensive data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study.    SETTING: The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2004 to 2009.    PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS were U.S. adults aged 30 to 64 years. The sample size ranged from 1275 to 1346.    MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included 13 cognitive test scores spanning domains of learning/memory, language/verbal, attention, visuo-spatial/visuo-construction, psychomotor speed, executive function, and mental status.    RESULTS: Within reference ranges and after Bonferroni correction, elevated free thyroxine (fT4) was associated with better performance on tests o…
15833592	Human cortical responses during one-bit delayed-response tasks: an fMRI study.	aging	2005-05-15	Neuroimaging study of cognition across aging requires simple tasks ensuring: (i) high rate of correct performances in neurophysiological settings; and (ii) significant modulation of cortical activity. As a preliminary step, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study tested the hypothesis that very simple delayed-response tasks fit these requirements in normal young adults. The short-term memory (STM) variant included a sequence of cue stimulus (two vertical bars), delay period (blank screen for only 5s), go stimulus, and motor response compatible with the taller vertical bar. Noteworthy, the retention (only one bit) could be based on visuo-spatial, phonological, and somatomotor coding. In the control variant (no STM, NSTM), the cue stimulus was present during the delay period. Results showed high rate of correct performances in both tasks (about 95%). Compared to the NSTM task (delay period), the STM task enhanced cortical responses in bilateral dorsolateral prefron…
219051	Changes in hormonal activities relative to the severity of essential hypertension.	aging	1979-05-??	Endocrine activity in patients with essential hypertension was studied by measuring the urinary excretion of catecholamines, prostaglandin E (PGE) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Simultaneously, plasma renin activity, concentrations of serum sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were determined. Systolic blood pressure and BUN increased progressively with age until the sixth decade. Urinary excretion of norepinephrine was correlated with the systolic blood pressure. In contrast, plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of PGE decreased progressively with the increase in systolic blood pressure. Although the cause of essential hypertension is not known, it is suggested that hypertension accelerates the aging process in the kidney and thus decreases renal PGE synthesis. This decrease of PGE in turn causes a reduction of plasma renin activity, possibly either by accelerating the retention of sodium and water or by failing to stimulate renin synthesis. A…
6572368	Structural and biological characteristics of connective tissue activating peptide (CTAP-III), a major human platelet-derived growth factor.	aging	1983-02-??	Connective tissue activating peptides (CTAPs) extracted from leukocytes and platelets stimulate glycolysis and synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and DNA in cultured human connective tissue cells. CTAP-III, isolated from fresh or outdated human platelets, is a low molecular weight single-chain protein with an isoelectric point of 8.5 that markedly stimulates DNA synthesis and multiple aspects of glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan metabolism. This report presents a definitive comparison of CTAP-III prepared by two methods [one designated (A), alternative] with similar platelet proteins described by others, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and low-affinity platelet factor 4 (LA-PF-4). CTAP-III, CTAP-III(A), LA-PF-4, and beta-TG have common antigenic determinants documented by immunoprecipitation and radioimmunoassay. CTAP-III, CTAP-III(A), and LA-PF-4 are biologically active in that they stimulate DNA and glycosaminoglycan synthesis by human synovial cells; beta-TG is inactive. Carboxyl-termin…
11109046	Risk factors for osteoporosis: A review.	aging	????-??-??	Skeletal fragility and falls are the 2 most potent factors leading to osteoporotic fractures. The aim of this article is to review factors associated with women's risk of developing skeletal fragility and subsequent osteoporosis. Many factors have been implicated, but the evidence for some is unsubstantial. Low premenopausal bone mineral density (BMD), a decrease in BMD, and an increase in bone fragility -- which occur as a result of both aging and the menopause -- are major determinants of subsequent risk for osteoporotic fracture. In addition, low body mass index (BMI), low calcium intake, low physical activity, and smoking can affect BMD. The relative importance of the effects these physical and lifestyle factors have on BMD in midlife women is not fully established. The impact of gynecologic history (parity, lactation, oral contraceptive use, age of menarche) on BMD is uncertain.
7058086	Decrease of thymic hormone serum level in Cockayne syndrome.	aging	1982-02-??	Previous reports concerning children with Cockayne syndrome had described decreased T cell proliferative responses and renal anomalies which could be associated with immunologic disturbances. Herein, the thymic function was evaluated by measuring the serum level of thymic hormone. This serum level was found to be undetectable or decreased in seven cases of Cockayne syndrome. Active serum concentrations varied between 0 and 1/8, whereas normal children of the same age show activity in the range between 1/16 and 1/64. In contrast, T cell function, explored by phytohemagglutinin and Concavalin A responses, and mixed lymphocyte cultures was normal. Whether or not this premature sign of immunological aging is primary or secondary to other manifestations of the syndrome is still difficult to assess.
8041604	Formation of extrachromosomal circular DNA in HeLa cells by nonhomologous recombination.	aging	1994-07-11	Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) generated from chromosomal DNA is found in all mammalian cells and increases with cell stress or aging. Studies of eccDNA structure and mode of formation provide insight into mechanisms of instability of the mammalian genome. Previous studies have suggested that eccDNA is generated through a process involving recombination between repetitive sequences. However, we observed that approximately one half of the small eccDNA fragments cloned from HeLa S3 cells were composed entirely of nonrepetitive or low-copy DNA sequences. We analyzed four of these fragments by polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing and found that they were complete eccDNAs. We then screened a human genomic library with the eccDNAs to isolate the complementary chromosomal sequences. Comparing the recombination junctions within the eccDNAs with the chromosomal sequences from which they were derived revealed that nonhomologous recombination was involved in their formation…
20032481	The sex-specific role of plasma folate in mediating the association of dietary quality with depressive symptoms.	lifespan, aging	2010-02-??	Folate deficiency has been implicated in the etiology of unipolar depression. In this study, we attempted to cross-link plasma folate, depressive symptoms, and dietary quality (or dietary intake of folate) together in a comprehensive framework, while examining effect modification of those associations by sex. This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of 1681 participants aged 30-64 y (Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Lifespan Study). Participants were administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Measures of plasma folate and dietary intakes (2 24-h recalls) from which the 2005-Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was computed were available. Multivariate logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SM) were conducted. Compared with the lowest tertile, the middle and uppermost tertiles of plasma folate were associated with a 39-40% reduced odds of elevated CES-D (> or =16) among women [adjusted odds ratio (T(3) vs. T(1)) = 0.6…
29397942	Senescence-messaging secretome factors trigger premature senescence in human endometrium-derived stem cells.	aging	2018-??-19	Accumulating evidence suggests that the senescence-messaging secretome (SMS) factors released by senescent cells play a key role in cellular senescence and physiological aging. Phenomenon of the senescence induction in human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MESCs) in response to SMS factors has not yet been described. In present study, we examine a hypothesis whether the conditioned medium from senescent cells (CM-old) may promote premature senescence of young MESCs. In this case, we assume that SMS factors, containing in CM-old are capable to trigger senescence mechanism in a paracrine manner. A long-term cultivation MESCs in the presence of CM-old caused deceleration of cell proliferation along with emerging senescence phenotype, including increase in both the cell size and SA-β-Gal activity. The phosphorylation of p53 and MAPKAPK-2, a direct target of p38MAPK, as well as the expression of p21Cip1 and p16Ink4a were increased in CM-old treated cells with senescence developi…
512605	A stability study of the esterase D isoenzymes.	aging	1979-01-??	A study of the changes in electrophoretic patterns of EsD 1 and 2--1 phenotypes in progressively aging bloodstains was carried out and resulted in the establishment of criteria for the proper interpretation of such patterns. With these criteria, the EsD isoenzymes in dried bloodstains were found to have a maximum stability of four weeks. While degradation of the isoenzyme in fluid blood at 37 degrees C was complete by the third day, instability was not detected until the sixth week in fluid samples stored at 3 degrees C; the presence or type of anticoagulant had no observable effect on the 3 degrees C samples. When fluid blood was stored at room temperature, the presence of anticoagulant and preservative did not enhance the stabilityof EsD. Critrate-fluoride did not produce any observable effect; heparin, oxalate, and EDTA increased the rate of degradation, with EDTA being the most detrimental, reducing the stable period to three days.
22500004	Endothelial nitric oxide synthase mediates cutaneous vasodilation during local heating and is attenuated in middle-aged human skin.	aging	2012-06-??	Local skin heating is used to assess microvascular function in clinical populations because NO is required for full expression of the response; however, controversy exists as to the precise NO synthase (NOS) isoform producing NO. Human aging is associated with attenuated cutaneous vasodilation but little is known about the middle aged, an age cohort used for comparison with clinical populations. We hypothesized that endothelial NOS (eNOS) is the primary isoform mediating NO production during local heating, and eNOS-dependent vasodilation would be reduced in middle-aged skin. Vasodilation was induced by local heating (42°C) and during acetylcholine dose-response (ACh-DR: 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0, 100.0 mmol/l) protocols. Four microdialysis fibers were placed in the skin of 24 men and women; age cohorts were 12 middle-aged (53 ± 1 yr) and 12 young (23 ± 1 yr). Sites served as control, nonselective NOS inhibited [N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)], inducible NOS (iNOS) in…
19706884	Comprehensive assessment of T-cell receptor beta-chain diversity in alphabeta T cells.	aging	2009-11-05	The adaptive immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of T- and B-cell antigen receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential pathogens. In alphabeta T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 10(16) distinct alphabeta pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRbeta genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRbeta receptor diversit…
25415304	The daidzein metabolite, 6,7,4'-Trihydroxyisoflavone, is a novel inhibitor of PKCα in suppressing solar UV-induced matrix metalloproteinase 1.	aging	2014-11-19	Soy isoflavone is an attractive source of functional cosmetic materials with anti-wrinkle, whitening and skin hydration effects. After consumption, the majority of soy isoflavones are converted to their metabolites in the human gastrointestinal tract. To understand the physiological impact of soy isoflavone on the human body, it is necessary to evaluate and address the biological function of its metabolites. In this study, we investigated the effect of 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone (6,7,4'-THIF), a major metabolite of daidzein, against solar UV (sUV)-induced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in normal human dermal fibroblasts. MMPs play a critical role in the degradation of collagen in skin, thereby accelerating the aging process of skin. The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MKK)3/6/p38 and MKK4/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling pathways are known to modulate MMP-1 fu…
3407612	Zinc status of healthy elderly adults: response to supplementation.	aging	1988-08-??	The zinc status of 53 healthy elderly subjects was evaluated. The dietary Zn intake estimated by 24-h recall was 9.2 mg/d and 65% of subjects had intakes less than two-thirds of the RDA. Mean serum Zn concentration (13.0 mumol/L) and urinary Zn excretion (7.0 mumol/d) were normal. The Zn content of platelets, mononuclear cells, and polymorphonuclear cells was 5.8, 147, and 135 nmol/10(9) cells, respectively. Seventeen subjects were supplemented for 28 d with 30 mg Zn/d. The mean concentration of Zn in serum and urine increased 24% and 2.5-fold, respectively. Zn content of platelets and leukocytes did not change with Zn supplementation. The concentration of visceral proteins (ie, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein) and immunoglobulins (ie, IgG, IgA, and IgM) did not change with Zn supplementation. The data indicate that aging per se does not necessarily imply poor Zn status.
29602299	Identification of human skeletal muscle miRNA related to strength by high-throughput sequencing.	aging	2018-??-01	The loss of muscle size, strength, and quality with aging is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The regulatory pathways that impact the muscle phenotype include the translational regulation maintained by microRNAs (miRNA). Yet the miRNAs that are expressed in human skeletal muscle and relationship to muscle size, strength, and quality are unknown. Using next-generation sequencing, we selected the 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs and then analyzed them in vastus lateralis muscle, obtained by biopsy from middle-aged males ( n = 48; 50.0 ± 4.3 yr). Isokinetic strength testing and midthigh computed tomography was undertaken for muscle phenotype analysis. Muscle attenuation was measured by computerized tomography and is inversely proportional to myofiber lipid content. miR-486-5p accounted for 21% of total miR sequence reads, with miR-10b-5p, miR-133a-3p, and miR-22-3p accounting for a further 15, 12, and 10%, respectively. Isokinetic knee extension strength a…
27208628	Lipid deregulation in UV irradiated skin cells: Role of 25-hydroxycholesterol in keratinocyte differentiation during photoaging.	aging	2017-??-??	Skin photoaging due to UV irradiation is a degenerative process that appears more and more as a growing concern. Lipids, including oxysterols, are involved in degenerative processes; as skin cells contain various lipids, the aim of our study was to evaluate first, changes in keratinocyte lipid levels induced by UV exposure and second, cellular effects of oxysterols in cell morphology and several hallmarks of keratinocyte differentiation. Our mass spectrometry results demonstrated that UV irradiation induces changes in lipid profile of cultured keratinocytes; in particular, ceramides and oxysterols, specifically 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), were increased. Using holography and confocal microscopy analyses, we highlighted cell thickening and cytoskeletal disruption after incubation of keratinocytes with 25-OH. These alterations were associated with keratinocyte differentiation patterns: autophagy stimulation and intracellular calcium increase as measured by cytofluorometry, and increas…
2137474	Measurement of cortisol and lymphocyte subpopulations in depressed and conduct-disordered adolescents.	aging	1990-02-??	Lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 11 adolescents with major depressive disorder, 11 with conduct disorder, and eight normal age-matched subjects. No significant differences were noted on any T or B cell measure between the groups. Further, no significant correlations were found between any cortisol measure (baseline cortisol, post-dexamethasone cortisol, urinary free cortisol) and any lymphocyte measure in either depressed or conduct-disordered adolescents. The negative findings in this small sample contrast with those reported in adult patients and suggest that an aging effect may be associated with the immunological changes reported in older depressed patients.
24947434	Prevention of age-related endothelial dysfunction by habitual aerobic exercise in healthy humans: possible role of nuclear factor κB.	aging	2014-12-??	Habitual aerobic exercise prevents age-related impairments in endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). We have hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) impairs EDD with sedentary aging, and habitual aerobic exercise prevents this age-related suppression of EDD by NF-κB. To test this hypothesis, we have inhibited NF-κB signalling via oral salsalate administration in healthy older aerobic exercise-trained adults (OT, n=14, 58 ± 2 years), older non-exercising adults (ON, n=16, 61 ± 1 years) and young non-exercising controls (YN, n=8, 23 ± 1 years). Salsalate reduced endothelial cell expression of NF-κB p65 by ~25% in ON (P<0.05) but did not significantly change expression in OT or YN (P>0.05). EDD, assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), was improved by salsalate in ON (4.0 ± 0.7% compared with 6.8 ± 0.7%, placebo compared with salsalate, P<0.001) but did not change with salsalate in OT or YN (OT: 7.2 ± 0.7% compared with 7.7 ± 0…
19111279	Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and incident depressive symptoms over 6 years in older persons: the InCHIANTI study.	aging	2009-06-01	BACKGROUND: We test the hypothesis that in older persons higher plasma levels of inflammatory markers predict the development of depressive symptoms during a 6-year follow-up.    METHOD: This study is part of the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, aging in the Chianti area) study, a prospective population-based study of older persons. The sample consisted of 991 participants, ages 65 years and older. Serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, and IL-18 were measured. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the 3- and 6-year follow-ups with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Depressed mood was defined as CES-D > 20. Potential confounders were baseline variables related to sociodemographic, somatic health, and functional status.    RESULTS: At baseline, IL-1ra levels were significantly higher (p = .004) in depressed compared with nondepressed partic…
6736578	The potential role of psychosocial stress on levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose in elderly people.	aging	1984-07-??	Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) mainly reflects the average blood glucose levels during the 8 to 12 weeks preceding the sampling. It is elevated in diabetic patients. The HbA1c level has also been reported to rise with age. In this experiment the influence of aging as well as social understimulation on HbA1c and fasting blood glucose has been studied. Sixty elderly people (M = 78 years) were selected at random from two different floors at a senior citizen apartment building. Half of the group was introduced to a psychosocial activation program, whereas the other was followed as a control group. Psychophysiological evaluations were performed before and after 3 and 6 months of experimental time. Social activities increased three-fold in the experimental group. There was also an increased interaction among the tenants and the staff in the experimental group. Over the 6-month period, significantly improved HbA1c levels were observed in the experimental group compared with the control group (p less …
20238238	Genetic and environmental influences on cortisol regulation across days and contexts in middle-aged men.	aging	2010-07-??	Cortisol is an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity to stress, but few twin studies have examined the heritability of cortisol concentrations in adults across the diurnal cycle and in different contexts. Saliva samples were provided by 783 middle-aged male twins on one laboratory and two home days as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Significant cortisol heritability estimates were found for laboratory measures only: awakening (.56); 30 min after awakening (.48); 1000 h (.42); mean output across the day (.43); and mean cortisol awakening response (.64). Twin correlations at home were low. In the laboratory, they were unchanged for fraternal twins, but increased for identical twins. Greater measurement error at home did not appear to account for home-laboratory differences. The results suggest that genetic factors influence cortisol responses to specific environmental stressors. Thus, cortisol levels are correlated in identical twins only when they un…
6322651	The spin-label approach to labeling membrane protein sulfhydryl groups.	aging	1983-??-??	Labeling experiments with viable membrane preparations are optimally undertaken where conditions are extremely mild (minimal excess of modification reagent, very short reaction times) in order to reduce the possibilities of introducing artifacts (cell aging and death, denaturation, etc.). Furthermore, specificity of labeling is a critical requirement where the system is complex and contains many proteins. The spin label IV described above offers several advantages over previously employed reagents. By virtue of its reversibility and ease of quantitation, one may repetitively label and remove label from the same membrane preparation in order to check reproducibility while using the same sample as a control.
22197254	Thin-film octadecyl-silica glass coating for automated 96-blade solid-phase microextraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for analysis of benzodiazepines.	aging	2012-07-13	A thin-film octadecyl (C18)-silica glass coating was developed as the extraction phase for an automated 96-blade solid-phase microextraction (SPME) system coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Various factors (e.g., sol-gel composition and aging time, coating preparation speed, coating thickness, and drying conditions) affecting the quality of C18-silica glass thin-film coating were studied and optimized. The results showed that the stability and durability of the coating are functions of the coating thickness and drying conditions. Coating thickness is controlled by sol-gel composition, aging time and the withdrawal speed in the dipping method. Automated sample preparation was achieved using a robotic autosampler that enabled simultaneous preparation of 96 samples in a 96-well plate format. Under the optimum SPME conditions the proposed system requires a total of 140 min for preparation of all 96 samples (i.e., 30 min preconditioning, 40 min equilibri…
4062510	Activity of erythrocyte alanine aminotransferase in the Polish population.	aging	1985-??-??	Alanine aminotransferase activities were tested in erythrocytes of Polish population sample of 213 adults (105 women and 108 men) and 95 children (aging 6 months to 4 years). In the tests a modified method of Wróblewski and Cabaud was used. A significant scatter of enzyme activities was noted, which ranged in adults between 0.76 and 36.86 mU/ml. In all studied groups, GPT 1 type individuals showed the highest and GPT 2 type donors the lowest activity of the enzyme. Mean activity of GPT 1 type adults was 19.27 mU/ml, in GPT 2-1 adults 13.6 mU/ml and in GPT 2 adults 8.87 mU/ml. GPT 2 type activity corresponds to approximately 46% and GPT 2-1 type activity to, approximately, 71% activity of GPT 1 type. Independently of GPT type, activity of the enzyme was lower in women in whom it amounted to 71-83% activity detected in men. In children, alanine aminotransferase activity was higher than in adults about 15-29%.
12402171	High incidence of JC viruria in JC-seropositive older individuals.	aging	2002-10-??	The prevalence of the human JC virus (JCV) in the general population at various ages was investigated. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect viral DNA in the urine. The results showed that the incidence of JC viruria was low in the young population, but it was high in the elderly. Hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed for JCV seroprevalence study. The results showed that the seropositive rate of JCV was lower in children than that in adults. The ratio of viruria to seropositive for JCV increased with age and reached 79.7% for those older than 70 years. The results indicated that aging immunity may correlate with JCV reactivation.
18691777	NT-pro-BNP for differential diagnosis in patients with syncope.	aging	2009-11-12	NT-pro-BNP has been proposed as a good predictor of syncope adverse outcome in the Emergency Department (ED) [Pfister R, Diedrichs H, Larbig R, Erdmann E, Schneider CA. NT-pro-BNP for differential diagnosis in patients with syncope. Int J Cardiol 2008 Jan 29]. We hereby summarize four critical points that should be taken into account when seeking to identify a cardiac cause of syncope or dealing with a risk stratification approach of the patient in the ED. The first issue is that patients admitted to the hospital after syncope are usually sicker than those discharged because of a higher rate of co-morbidity. Secondly, the focus on discharged patients is of paramount importance to assess the goodness of a predictor. Aging, which affects NT-pro-BNP levels, is a limiting factor in interpreting results. Finally, in order to add valuable information to the clinical practice, we suggest to compare results obtained by NT-pro-BNP values and the most used prognostic risk scores, such as the OES…
23174055	Stability, transdermal penetration, and cutaneous effects of ascorbic acid and its derivatives.	aging	2012-12-??	Topically applied antioxidants exert their benefits by offering protection from damaging free radicals and over-the-counter cosmeceuticals incorporating antioxidants are among the most popular anti-aging products available. One potent antioxidant of particular note, vitamin C, has been extensively utilized because it possesses a variety of other cutaneous benefits including photoprotection from UV A & B, neocollagenesis, inhibition of melanogenesis and improvement of a variety of inflammatory skin disorders. However, the instability of this water-soluble vitamin, together with difficulties associated with its topical delivery, has presented issues for the formulation chemist. This article reviews the scientific data and clinical studies that underpin the stability, percutaneous absorption, and cutaneous effects of vitamin C together with its commonly utilized, commercially available derivatives.
223592	High and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in myocardial and cerebral infarction.	aging	1979-03-??	High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LdL) cholesterol levels were measured in fasting blood samples from 950 healthy subjects and 188 aged patients by a new simple method. The HDL-cholesterol levels and HDL/LDL-cholesterol ratios are significantly higher in females than in males. In the healthy subjects, there are slight decreases in the levels of HDL-cholesterol and HDL/LDL-cholesterol ratio with aging in both sexes. The patients with myocardial infarction had significantly lower HDL-cholesterol levels and HDL/LDL-cholesterol ratios as compared to those of the group without infarction. On the contrary, no differences in total lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in the patients with cerebral infarction. The results, obtained in respect of electrocardiographic findings after the isoproterenol stress test, suggest that the HDL-cholesterol levels and HDL/LDL-cholesterol ratios may be related not only to the established myocardial infarction, but also to the…
21961714	Adrenal androgens and the menopausal transition.	aging	2011-09-??	The concept that adrenal androgen production gradually declines with age has changed after analysis of longitudinal data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). It is now recognized that 4 adrenal androgens rise during the menopausal transition in most women. Ethnic and individual differences in sex steroids are more apparent in circulating adrenal steroids than in either estradiol or cyclic ovarian steroid hormone profiles, particularly during the early and late perimenopause. Thus, adrenal steroid production may play a larger role in the occurrence of symptoms and the potential for healthier aging than previously recognized.
28279654	Bloodstream Amyloid-beta (1-40) Peptide, Cognition, and Outcomes in Heart Failure.	aging	2017-11-??	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In the brain, amyloid-beta generation participates in the pathophysiology of cognitive disorders; in the bloodstream, the role of amyloid-beta is uncertain but may be linked to sterile inflammation and senescence. We explored the relationship between blood levels of amyloid-beta 1-40 peptide (Aβ40), cognition, and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and heart failure [HF]-related) in ambulatory patients with HF.    METHODS: Bloodstream Aβ40 was measured in 939 consecutive patients with HF. Cognition was evaluated with the Pfeiffer questionnaire (adjusted for educational level) at baseline and during follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analyses and measurements of performance (discrimination, calibration, and reclassification) were used, with competing risk for specific causes of death.    RESULTS: Over 5.1 ± 2.9 years, 471 patients died (all-cause): 250 from cardiovascular causes and 131 HF-related. The median Aβ40 concentration was 519.1 pg/mL [Q1-Q3:…
23749875	Brain signal variability is parametrically modifiable.	aging	2014-11-??	Moment-to-moment brain signal variability is a ubiquitous neural characteristic, yet remains poorly understood. Evidence indicates that heightened signal variability can index and aid efficient neural function, but it is not known whether signal variability responds to precise levels of environmental demand, or instead whether variability is relatively static. Using multivariate modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging-based parametric face processing data, we show here that within-person signal variability level responds to incremental adjustments in task difficulty, in a manner entirely distinct from results produced by examining mean brain signals. Using mixed modeling, we also linked parametric modulations in signal variability with modulations in task performance. We found that difficulty-related reductions in signal variability predicted reduced accuracy and longer reaction times within-person; mean signal changes were not predictive. We further probed the various differ…
19394314	Crystal structures of human group-VIIA phospholipase A2 inhibited by organophosphorus nerve agents exhibit non-aged complexes.	aging	2009-08-15	The enzyme group-VIIA phospholipase A2 (gVIIA-PLA2) is bound to lipoproteins in human blood and hydrolyzes the ester bond at the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrates with a short sn-2 chain. The enzyme belongs to a serine hydrolase superfamily of enzymes, which react with organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents. OPs ultimately exert their toxicity by inhibiting human acetycholinesterase at nerve synapses, but may additionally have detrimental effects through inhibition of other serine hydrolases. We have solved the crystal structures of gVIIA-PLA2 following inhibition with the OPs diisopropylfluorophosphate, sarin, soman and tabun. The sarin and soman complexes displayed a racemic mix of P(R) and P(S) stereoisomers at the P-chiral center. The tabun complex displayed only the P(R) stereoisomer in the crystal. In all cases, the crystal structures contained intact OP adducts that had not aged. Aging refers to a secondary process OP complexes can go through, which dealkylates the nerve agen…
20303933	Thermal degradation of polyethylene glycol 6000 and its effect on the assay of macroprolactin.	aging	2010-06-??	OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of partially degraded polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) as a precipitant for macroprolactin.    DESIGN AND METHODS: PEG was heated to 63 degrees C in air for up to 20 days and its effectiveness assessed as a precipitant for sera containing normal prolactin or macroprolactin. Decomposition was studied chemically and with NMR spectroscopy.    RESULTS: Thermal degradation was similar to what had occurred over several years of natural degradation. Initially PEG degraded 2-5 days caused excess precipitation of monomeric prolactin (false-positive macroprolactinemia). Samples degraded 18-20 days failed to precipitate macroprolactin, giving false negative results. Two 1H NMR peaks at 4-4.5 ppm were not detectable in undegraded PEG but were after 1 day. Their relative integral increased to 20 days.    CONCLUSIONS: Aging of PEG can be accelerated by heating. The suitability of PEG for use in macroprolactin assays can be assessed by the absence of peaks at 4-4.…
26912464	Infants and elderlies are susceptible to zinc deficiency.	longevity, aging	2016-02-25	The importance of zinc for human health has been recognized since the early 1960s, but today there is little concern about zinc deficiency in developed countries. In this study, we measured the zinc concentration in hair from 28,424 Japanese subjects (18,812 females and 9,612 males) and found that 1,754 subjects (6.17%) had zinc concentrations lower than 2 standard deviations (86.3 ppm) below the control reference range, which qualifies as zinc deficiency. In particular, a considerable proportion of elderlies and children (20% or more) were found to have marginal to severe zinc deficiency. A zinc concentration of 9.7 ppm was the lowest observed in a 51-year-old woman; this concentration was approximately 1/13 of the mean reference level. The prevalence of zinc deficiency in adults increased with aging to a maximum of 19.7% by the 8(th) decade of life, and decreased to 3.4% above 90-year-old. The proportion of zinc deficiency in infants 0-4 years was 36.5% in males and 47.3% in females;…
2265990	Human retinal pigment epithelium contains two distinct species of superoxide dismutase.	aging	1990-12-??	Superoxide dismutase (SOD) molecules occur in all cells exposed to an oxygen-containing environment, including retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Previous studies of nonhuman RPE have either probed specifically for copper-zinc-containing SOD (CuZn-SOD) or have not distinguished between CuZn-SOD and the SOD molecule that contains manganese (Mn-SOD). The authors used specific enzymatic assays and immunologic probes, both in vivo and in vitro, to show that human RPE cells contain both CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD. The CuZn-SOD had a diffuse cytosolic distribution, whereas the Mn form was located primarily in the mitochondria. The role of SODs in protecting the chorioretinal complex against oxidative damage and with regard to aging processes is not well understood and warrants further investigation, and the two cellular forms of SOD should be considered in future studies.
23244722	Benign prostatic hyperplasia: clinical manifestations and evaluation.	aging	2012-12-??	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common condition, related to aging and causing symptoms, called lower urinary tract symptoms. On account of its huge prevalence, it is important for clinicians who are involved in the management of patients with BPH to be aware of the very strict recommendations for BPH evaluation. In this article, we describe the different steps and procedures doctors should follow to evaluate these patients; symptoms and signs of BPH are reviewed, as well as the clinical evaluation steps and examinations available. The basic evaluation of the patients with BPH should include, according to the recommendations of the most relevant international guidelines, lower urinary tract symptoms evaluation with appropriate symptom scores, digital rectal examination, voiding charts, prostate-specific antigen and creatinine measurement, urinalysis, and imaging of the urinary tract.
20841372	Statins and serum cholesterol's associations with incident dementia and mild cognitive impairment.	aging	2011-11-??	BACKGROUND: Statin use and serum cholesterol reduction have been proposed as preventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).    METHODS: 1604 and 1345 eligible participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were followed after age 50 for a median time of around 25 years, to examine the incidence of dementia (n=259) and MCI (n=138), respectively. Statin use (ever-use and time-dependent use), total cholesterol levels (TC; first visit and time-dependent), TC change trajectory from first visit and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C):TC ratio (first visit and time-dependent) were the main exposures of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used.    RESULTS: Participants with incident dementia had a higher first-visit TC compared with participants who remained free of dementia and MCI, while first-visit TC was higher among statin ever-users compared with never-users (age-unadjusted associations). Statin users had a two- to threefold lower risk of develo…
3135465	Progressive changes in LH and FSH and LH: FSH ratio in women throughout reproductive life.	aging	1988-05-??	Gonadotropin secretion during the post-menopausal period is considerably higher than during the reproductive years. In this study, we present evidence that changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian unit occur over a period of years before the onset of menstrual irregularity which heralds the menopause. FSH and LH were measured in blood samples taken on 6 days during the mid-follicular phase from 127 regularly cycling women aged between 23 and 49 yr. The women aged 23-30 yr were taken as the control group and the remainder were grouped in 2-yr age bands. A significant increase in FSH underwent a further increase in the oldest group (48-49 yr) in whom LH also became significantly elevated. The difference in the timing of the change in FSH and LH concentrations was related not only to chronological age but also to the number of years before the menopause. The increase in FSH occurred 5-6 yr pre-menopause, that in LH not until 3-4 yr before the cessation of menstruation. It is conclude…
2409389	Reflex cardiovascular regulation in humans.	aging	1985-??-??	Although studies of the cardiovascular control exerted by arterial baroreceptors in man are limited by technical and ethical problems, the variable-pressure neck-chamber technique has provided a considerable amount of information about this topic. This paper focuses on the carotid baroreceptor reflex as evaluated by studies using the neck-chamber technique and examines this control in a number of physiological and pathophysiological states. The results of these studies suggest that in normotensive subjects the set-point of the reflex is located eccentrically toward its saturation, which makes this homeostatic mechanism more effective in counteracting a blood-pressure fall than a blood-pressure rise. They also suggest that the concept of an impairment of the arterial baroreflex in aging, exercise, and hypertension, though valid for the baroreceptor control of heart rate, is no longer tenable for the baroreceptor control of arterial pressure. The paper also reviews in humans the effects …
24595917	Conservative Christianity, partnership, hormones, and sex in late life.	aging	2014-10-??	Using nationally representative data from the 2005-2006 U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, this study queried relationship, sexual, and sex hormone patterns among married evangelical women and men aged 57-85, relative to those in other religions. Results suggested that despite potentially more unequal gender roles, evangelical older women may have better marital quality, perhaps due to the recent transformation of their male counterparts into authoritative, yet-supportive, "soft patriarchs." Correspondingly, these women, especially those with greater subjective religiosity or more support from a spouse, reported consistently better sexual outcomes than their counterparts in other religions. In addition, they also had lower estradiol, whether due to psychobiological effects of their better relationships or self-selection of those with differential hormone levels into particular partnership patterns. While older men in these communities also experienced more satisfacto…
10052293	Peripheral hemodynamics evaluated by acceleration plethysmography in workers exposed to lead.	aging	1999-01-??	To clarify the effect of lead exposure on peripheral hemodynamics, acceleration plethysmography (APG) was performed for 48 male subjects occupationally exposed to lead (exposure group) and 43 male subjects with no history of occupational exposure to lead (control group). In the exposure group, the blood lead concentration (Pb-B) was also measured. Each APG parameter was assessed by comparing measured data with the standard aging curves. A significant negative correlation was obtained between the parameter--b/a and Pb-B. The exposure group showed significantly lower values of parameters--b/a (p < 0.01) and d/a (p < 0.05) than the control group. The parameter--b/a in the exposure group dose-dependently decreased with increases in length of working career (duration of exposure to lead) and Pb-B. The parameter--b/a significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in subjects with working careers of 5 years or more and in subjects whose Pb-B was 40 micrograms/100 ml or more. These results suggest that le…
3871571	Bone mineral density in the femoral neck: quantitative assessment using dual-energy projection radiography.	aging	1985-03-??	Two different dual-energy projection radiography techniques were used to quantitate bone mineral density in the femoral neck. A heterogeneous population of normal aging individuals of both genders was studied. Using a dual-energy scanned projection method, femoral neck mineralization was shown to decline with age in men and women with normal endocrine status, and to correlate positively with serum calcium level in women and both genders combined. No significant relation to incidence and severity of vertebral body compression fractures, the Singh trabecular index, glomerular filtration rate, urinary calcium excretion, plasma levels of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or alkaline phosphatase was demonstrated. According to both methods, femoral neck density tended to be higher in taller and heavier subjects. Although it may not be possible to predict accurately the occurrence of femoral neck fracture in a given individual, dual-energy scanned projection radiography appears to be useful in …
23891597	Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after anti-influenza vaccination: catecholaminergic effects of immune system.	aging	2013-11-??	Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a well-known condition, which leads to sudden transient regional systolic dysfunction. It mostly affects aging women and is usually precipitated by emotional or physical stress. Despite the tremendous amount of literature on TTC, cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity is the only thing known to be associated with pathogenesis. In our case, an elderly woman presented with an acute episode of TTC 24 hours after anti-influenza vaccination without any obvious stressor for sudden rise in the catecholamine level. Sudden postvaccination change in the cardiac sympathetic discharge is the most likely precipitant of TTC in this case.
22189452	APOE modifies the association between Aβ load and cognition in cognitively normal older adults.	aging	2012-01-24	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between β-amyloid (Aβ) load as measured by [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults.    METHODS: We studied 408 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) from January 2009 through March 2011. The participants underwent PiB PET and neuropsychometric testing within 6 months. The association between PiB retention and cognitive function was measured by partial correlation and an interaction with APOE status was tested using linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, and education.    RESULTS: Higher PiB retention was associated with cognitive performance (Spearman partial r = -0.18; p < 0.01), specifically the memory, language, attention/executive, and visual-spatial processing domains in the whole group of participants. The association between PiB retention and cognition was modified by the APOE status on linear regression …
8493293	Importance of genetic effects for monoamine oxidase activity in thrombocytes in twins reared apart and twins reared together.	aging	1993-03-??	The relative importance of shared genes, shared environments, and individual specific environmental effects for monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in thrombocytes was assessed in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. The sample consists of identical twins separated at an early age and reared apart (30 pairs), identical twins reared together (60 pairs), fraternal twins reared apart (66 pairs), and fraternal twins reared together (68 pairs), whose average age was 63.5 years; 49% were female. Consistent with the literature, the heritability of MAO activity was 0.77 and did not differ across cohort (under or over 63 years of age) or gender. Sharing rearing environments or similar experiences later in life does not result in familial similarity for MAO activity.
11258584	Oxygen saturation increases during childhood and decreases during adulthood among high altitude native Tibetians residing at 3,800-4,200m.	aging	2000-??-??	This report describes age differences in oxygen saturation throughout the life cycle in a sample of high altitude native Tibetans residing in villages at 3,800-4,200 m altitude in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Oxygen saturation of 3,812 Tibetans was measured by pulse oximetry and a subsample of 1,582 healthy, nonpregnant, nonsmokers from 1 week to 80 years of age was selected for analyses. Infants under 1 year of age had 5-6% lower oxygen saturation than the peak of 89.8% attained at 11 years of age. There was a steady increase in mean oxygen saturation-for-age during the first decade of life, but not during the second decade. Adult males exhibited a slight decrease starting in the 20-29 year age range. Adult females maintained the peak oxygen saturation through the 40-49 year age range, exhibiting a decrease in oxygen saturation beginning in the 50-59 year age range and as a result had higher oxygen saturation than males during the female reproductive span. Thus, developmental f…
19397858	The effect of non-visual working memory load on top-down modulation of visual processing.	aging	2009-06-??	While a core function of the working memory (WM) system is the active maintenance of behaviorally relevant sensory representations, it is also critical that distracting stimuli are appropriately ignored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the role of domain-general WM resources in the top-down attentional modulation of task-relevant and irrelevant visual representations. In our dual-task paradigm, each trial began with the auditory presentation of six random (high load) or sequentially ordered (low load) digits. Next, two relevant visual stimuli (e.g., faces), presented amongst two temporally interspersed visual distractors (e.g., scenes), were to be encoded and maintained across a 7-s delay interval, after which memory for the relevant images and digits was probed. When taxed by high load digit maintenance, participants exhibited impaired performance on the visual WM task and a selective failure to attenuate the neural processing of task-irrelevant scene stimuli.…
21422850	Antimüllerian hormone as a predictor of natural fecundability in women aged 30-42 years.	aging	2011-04-??	OBJECTIVE: To generate estimates of the association between markers of ovarian aging and natural fertility in a community sample at risk for ovarian aging.    METHODS: Women aged 30-44 years with no history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months provided early-follicular phase serum and urine (N=100). Subsequently, these women kept a diary to record menstrual bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. Serum was analyzed for estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), antimüllerian hormone, and inhibin B. Urine was analyzed for FSH and estrone 3-glucuronide. Diary data on menstrual cycle day and patterns of intercourse were used to calculate day-specific fecundability ratios.    RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of participants conceived within 6 months. After adjusting for age, 18 women (18%) with serum antimüllerian hormone levels of 0.7 ng/mL or less had significantly reduced fecundability given intercourse o…
12418027	Effect of antibiotics on the properties of poly(methylmethacrylate)-based bone cement.	aging	2002-??-??	The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between gentamicin concentration in Palacos R bone cement (in the mass fraction range of 0-9.4%) and various properties of the cement. The results from the thermal, density, and static compression tests show that gentamicin favors the cement polymerization in its final steps, and forms a diphasic structure with the cement [poly(methylmethacrylate)] matrix. The static compression properties in the dry state are only slightly modified by the presence of the antibiotic. Concerning aging in water at 37 degrees C, two types of behavior can be distinguished: below a critical concentration, approximately 3-4%, the extraction of gentamicin by water is slow and there is only a slight change of static compression properties. In contrast, above this critical concentration, the gentamicin extraction is fast and almost complete after 48 weeks, and there is a considerable loss of static compression properties.
22648381	Abnormal isoaspartyl residues in erythrocyte membranes from psoriatic patients.	aging	2012-08-??	Spontaneous protein deamidation of labile asparagines (Asn), generating abnormal isoaspartyl residues (IsoAsp), is associated with cell aging and enhanced by an oxidative microenvironment. The presence of isopeptide bonds impairs protein structure/function and can trigger autoimmune responses. To minimize the damage, IsoAsp can be "repaired" by a specific L-isoaspartate-(D-aspartate)-protein-O-methyltransferase. The condition of chronic oxidative stress reported in psoriatic patients, and the potential etiological role of unknown self-antigens, prompted us to investigate Asn deamidation in psoriatic tissues. Erythrocytes (RBC) were selected as the model system since, lacking protein synthesis apparatus, they are unable to replace damaged proteins. Blood samples were obtained from 36 patients and 34 controls. L-isoAsp content was highly increased in RBC membrane proteins from psoriatic patients. Deamidated species included ankyrin, band 4.1, band 4.2 and the integral membrane protein ba…
214140	Further characterization of human erythrocyte superoxide dismutase.	aging	1978-11-20	1. A simplified procedure for the preparation of highly purified human superoxide dismutase from erythrocytes was developed which avoided extremes of pH and ionic strength and the use of organic solvents; the properties of human and bovine proteins, prepared by the method, were compared. 2. Using the two dimensional electrophoretic procedure of O'Farrell, the human superoxide dismutase was found to consist of a single type of polypeptide. 3. The human protein was found to have a total of eight half-cystine residues per mole of protein, compared to six such residues for the bovine protein. The human protein has two sulfhydryl groups which are reactive toward mercurials when dissolved in 1M guanidine-hydrochloride and approximately 3 reactive sulfhydrls when the protein is dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The distribution of the eight sulfur atoms appears to consist of four involved in disulfide linkages, two deeply buried within the molecule and unreactive except under strongly…
3088351	Age-related differences in the pituitary prolactin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone.	aging	1986-07-14	We have previously reported that human subjects undergoing surgery for inguinal hernias exhibit an age-related attenuation in the plasma prolactin response, with no differences during resting conditions. We suggested that these differences were due to age-related neuroendocrine changes, but that peripheral factors may play a role as well. In the present study, we have assessed the pituitary response to 500 micrograms of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the very same subjects previously studied during surgery. Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to, as well as 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes following the intravenous administration of TRH. There was a clear-cut age-related attenuation in the pituitary prolactin response with no difference in the thyrotropin (TSH) response. Maximum prolactin response in the young subjects was 31.7 micrograms/l and 19.2 micrograms/l in old subjects (F(4) = 3.5, p less than .01, two-way ANOVA). These results indicate that the age-related differences…
28571965	Bone health in Down syndrome.	aging	2017-07-21	Patients with Down syndrome have a number of risk factors that theoretically could predispose them to osteoporosis, such as early aging, development disorders, reduced physical activity, limited sun exposure, frequent comorbidities and use of drug therapies which could affect bone metabolism. In addition, the bone mass of these people may be affected by their anthropometric and body composition peculiarities. In general terms, studies in adults with Down syndrome reported that these people have lower areal bone mineral density (g/cm) than the general population. However, most of them have not taken the smaller bone size of people with Down syndrome into account. In fact, when body mineral density is adjusted by bone size and we obtain volumetric body mineral density (g/cm), the difference between both populations disappears. On the other hand, although people with Down syndrome have risk factor of hypovitaminosis D, the results of studies regarding 25(OH)D in this population are not cl…
20300059	Genetic studies of human DNA repair proteins using yeast as a model system.	aging	2010-03-18	Understanding the roles of human DNA repair proteins in genetic pathways is a formidable challenge to many researchers. Genetic studies in mammalian systems have been limited due to the lack of readily available tools including defined mutant genetic cell lines, regulatory expression systems, and appropriate selectable markers. To circumvent these difficulties, model genetic systems in lower eukaryotes have become an attractive choice for the study of functionally conserved DNA repair proteins and pathways. We have developed a model yeast system to study the poorly defined genetic functions of the Werner syndrome helicase-nuclease (WRN) in nucleic acid metabolism. Cellular phenotypes associated with defined genetic mutant backgrounds can be investigated to clarify the cellular and molecular functions of WRN through its catalytic activities and protein interactions. The human WRN gene and associated variants, cloned into DNA plasmids for expression in yeast, can be placed under the cont…
6411806	Localization of calcium in red blood cells.	aging	1983-09-??	The distribution of calcium is demonstrated in human red blood cells (RBC) with a combined phosphate-pyroantimonate technique (PPA). Freshly collected blood and tissue biopsies were initially fixed in potassium phosphate-glutaraldehyde and the complexed calcium was subsequently visualized on Vibratome sections with potassium pyroantimonate. The majority of cells, both in isolated as well as "in situ" preparations, show a fine granular precipitate located at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. A minority of cells lack these membrane-associated deposits, exhibiting instead a random distribution of very fine precipitate in their cytoplasm. Capillary endothelial cells and pericytes are devoid of plasma membrane-bound precipitate. When irreversible crenation of RBC is induced by exposure to ionophore A 23187 and calcium, the sphero-echinocytes loose their membrane-bound precipitate, whereas the cells that retain their discocyte shape demonstrate the usual pattern of membrane-bound dep…
24760722	Human blastocysts exhibit unique microrna profiles in relation to maternal age and chromosome constitution.	aging	2014-07-??	PURPOSE: To determine microRNA (miRNA) expression in human blastocysts relative to advanced maternal age and chromosome constitution.    METHODS: Cryopreserved human blastocysts were warmed and underwent a trophectoderm biopsy for comprehensive chromosomal screening. Select blastocysts were then lysed, reverse transcribed, and pre-amplified prior to running real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using an internal constant housekeeping miRNA. Significant microRNA's of interest were then analyzed for their predicted genes and biological pathways. Additional cryopreserved blastocysts were warmed and stained for the SIRT1 protein for validation.    RESULTS: Human blastocysts exhibit unique miRNA expression profiles in relation to maternal age and chromosome constitution. miR-93 was exclusively expressed in blastocysts from women in their forties and further up-regulated with an abnormal chromosome complement. Up-regulated miR-93 resulted in an inverse down-regulation of targets …
6839023	Demonstration of a natural antigalactosyl IgG antibody on thalassemic red blood cells.	lifespan	1983-06-??	A modified antiglobulin test, based on the high affinity between the Fc portion of the red blood cell (RBC) bound IgG and the Fc receptor on the myeloid cell K-562, was utilized for demonstration of immunoglobulins (Ig) on thalassemic RBC. Ig was found on the RBC of 73 out of 80 patients with thalassemia. The immunoglobulins on the thalassemic RBC belonged to the IgG subclass and were autoreactive. Elution studies utilizing various carbohydrates, or by thermal stripping, indicated that at least part of the IgG molecules found on the thalassemic RBC were specifically reactive with terminal galactosyl residues on the RBC membrane. IgG antibodies with similar reactivity were also demonstrated in normal human serum. These natural antigalactosyl IgG antibodies from normal sera could bind to IgG-depleted thalassemic RBC. Thalassemic RBC and normal senescent RBC were previously found to contain reduced amounts of membrane sialic acid (SA). It is suggested that the antigalactosyl IgG antibodie…
20149437	Human umbilical cord stem cell encapsulation in calcium phosphate scaffolds for bone engineering.	aging	2010-05-??	Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) require an invasive procedure to harvest, and have lower self-renewal potential with aging. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) are a relatively new stem cell source; this study reveals a self-setting and load-bearing calcium phosphate construct that encapsulates these stem cells. The flexural strength (mean+/-sd; n=5) of the hUCMSC-encapsulating calcium phosphate cement (CPC) increased from (3.5+/-1.1) MPa without polyglactin fibers, to (11.7+/-2.1) MPa with 20% of polyglactin fibers (p<0.05). hUCMSCs attached to the bone mineral-mimicking scaffold in the osteogenic media and differentiated down the osteogenic lineage, yielding elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) gene expressions. ALP and OC on the CPC-fiber scaffold was 2-fold those on CPC control without fibers. hUCMSCs encapsulated inside the scaffolds retained excellent viability and cell density. The encapsulated hUCMSCs inside four different const…
25177015	Synthesis and protective effects of bis{4-[N,N-di-(carboxymethyl)amino]phenoxy}alkane derivatives on UVA-induced production of MMP-1 in human skin fibroblasts.	aging	2014-??-??	UV-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production is considered a cause of skin aging. In this study, a number of novel bis{4-[N,N-di-(carboxymethyl)amino]phenoxy}alkane derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as UVA-protective agents. These compounds significantly protected human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells from UVA-induced cytotoxicity and inhibited MMP-1 activation and expression with potency comparable to desferoxamine (DFO). Promoter activity assay indicated that they inhibited MMP-1 expression at the transcriptional level. Further studies revealed that the mechanism of these compounds may include blockage of the UVA-induced activation of the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Together, these results suggest that further development of these compounds may be of interest.
20364267	Closer correlation of cadmium in urine than that of cadmium in blood with tubular dysfunction markers in urine among general women populations in Japan.	aging	2011-02-??	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study are to investigate whether cadmium in blood (Cd-B) and cadmium in urine (Cd-U) correlate with each other irrespective of age among general populations and which one of Cd-B or Cd-U correlates more closely with three renal tubular dysfunction markers in urine of α₁-microglobulin (α₁-MG-U), β₂-microglobulin (β₂-MG-U) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG-U).    METHODS: Data on two exposure markers (Cd-B and Cd-U) and three effect markers (α₁-MG-U, β₂-MG-U and NAG-U) were collected for 1,403 adult women in non-polluted areas all over Japan. Possible significance of correlation between the parameters and dependency on age was examined by simple and multiple regression analysis.    RESULTS: Both Cd-B and Cd-U increased as a function of age. The two exposure markers correlated significantly with each other, and the Cd-U over Cd-B ratio also increased as a function of age. Although both Cd-B and Cd-U correlated significantly with the three effe…
820628	Pyruvate kinase isozymes in man. II. L type and erythrocyte-type isozymes. Electrofocusing and immunologic studies.	aging	1976-07-07	By focusing in sucrose, gradient L-type pyruvate kinase from human liver could be separated into 2 major forms (pI 6.28 +/- 0.03 and 5.85 +/- 0.09) and a minor more acid form (pI = 5). These different forms could also be detected by focusing in acrylamide-ampholine slab gel. The major forms were interconvertible, the equilibrium being shifted toward the acid form by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and SH reagents, and toward the alkaline form by proteinic factors extracted by ammonium sulphate fractionation from liver extracts and from hemolysates. These factors seemed to be responsible for the stabilization of the liver crude extract enzyme in its alkaline conformation. By acrylamide slab gel electrofocusing, erythrocyte pyruvate kinase from whole hemolysates exhibited a complex pattern composed of at least 3 introconvertible forms. The in vitro aging of the red blood cells and the storage of the hemolysates resulted in a progressive disappearance of the acid forms and in a strengthening of …
8064109	Does age play a role in clinical presentation of hypothyroidism?	aging	1994-09-??	OBJECTIVE: To determine if aging modifies the clinical presentation of hypothyroidism.    DESIGN: Comparison of 24 clinical signs of hypothyroidism between elderly patients (> or = 70 years of age) and younger patients (< or = 55 years of age).    SETTING: Prospective study of patients with chemically confirmed overt hypothyroidism.    PATIENTS: Sixty seven elderly patients (79.3 +/- 6.7 years) and 54 younger patients (40.8 +/- 9 years) were included in the study.    RESULTS: Neither mean duration of evolution nor mean thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level were different between the 2 groups. Two signs were found in more than 50% of the elderly patients (fatigue and weakness). Four signs were significantly less frequent in elderly patients (chilliness, paresthesiae, weight gain, and cramps). Mean number of clinical signs in the elderly (6.6 +/- 4) was significantly smaller than in young patients (9.3 +/- 4.7) (P < 0.01).    CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the presentation of hy…
9732886	Electrocardiographic conduction disturbances in association with low-level lead exposure (the Normative Aging Study).	aging	1998-09-01	Recent research indicates that cumulative exposure to lead may be more toxic than previously thought. This study was undertaken to examine the relation of low-level lead exposure to electrocardiographic (ECG) conduction disturbances among 775 men who participated in the Normative Aging Study (average age 68 years; range 48 to 93). We used K-x-ray fluorescence to measure lead levels in the tibia and patella, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure blood lead levels. The mean (SD) values for blood lead, tibia lead, and patella lead were 5.8 (3.4) microg/dl, 22.2 (13.4) microg/g, and 30.8 (19.2) microg/g, respectively. Bone lead levels were found to be positively associated with heart rate-corrected QT and QRS intervals, especially in younger men. Specifically, in men <65 years of age, a 10 microg/g increase in tibia lead was associated with an increase in the QT interval of 5.03 ms (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 9.22) and with an increase in the QRS interva…
18166495	Low-dose growth hormone administration mobilizes endothelial progenitor cells in healthy adults.	aging	2008-06-??	OBJECTIVE: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilize from the bone marrow secondary to a stimulus and home to sites of injury, where they differentiate into endothelial cells and contribute to the repair of damaged vasculature. We hypothesized that growth hormone (GH) administration would increase the number of circulating EPCs in adults and thereby represent a mechanism to enhance vascular health.    DESIGN: A prospective trial of low-dose GH (0.03mg/kg/week for 4 weeks followed by 0.06mg/kg/week for a maximum of four additional weeks) in 10 healthy adults (6 males and 4 females; mean age 37 years, range 26-65). Primary outcomes measured included the number of circulating EPCs as assessed by colony-forming unit (CFU) assay and flow cytometry. Secondary outcomes included plasma measurements of known mediators of EPC mobilization and indices of nitric oxide (NO). Outcomes were measured at baseline and at study completion.    RESULTS: GH administration increased serum IGF-1 (143ng/mL …
9060929	Are serum inflammatory markers age dependent in acute appendicitis?	aging	1997-03-??	BACKGROUND: Preoperative measurement of body inflammatory agents reduces unnecessary appendectomies by up to 30 percent. A decline in the formation of blood leukocytes and C-reactive protein with aging may hinder the correct diagnosis of appendicitis.    STUDY DESIGN: White cell count and C-reactive protein were determined before appendectomy in 600 patients aged 0 to 5 years, 6 to 19 years, 20 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and older than 80 years. Their records were analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and receiver-operating characteristic curves for C-reactive protein and white cell count to predict appendicitis were calculated separately for each age group.    RESULTS: The rates of negative explorations and perforations were highest at both extremes of age. In uncomplicated appendicitis, the diagnostic potential of white cell count was better than C-reactive protein in all age groups except infants. The C-reactive protein was elevated similarly…
6597461	Effect of age and sex on cortisol secretion in depressives and normals.	aging	1984-11-??	The mean 24-hour plasma level of cortisol with plasma sampling every 20-30 minutes was determined in 32 normal women aged 12-73, 40 normal men aged 10-55, 21 depressed women aged 20-61, and 11 depressed men aged 22-66. The mean levels of cortisol were higher in the group of depressives compared with the controls. Cortisol levels showed a significant linear correlation with age in normal women but not in normal men. Both depressed women and men had a significant linear increase of cortisol levels with age. The finding that age substantially contributes to increased levels of cortisol calls for cautious interpretation of any data concerning that hormone when the variable of age is not adequately controlled. Furthermore, aging and depression may have some underlying mechanisms whose elucidation may contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of vulnerability to affective disorders.
3238951	An example of anti-Yta demonstrating a change in its clinical significance.	lifespan	1988-??-??	The clinical significance of some red cell alloantibodies remains in doubt and can best be studied with long-term 51Cr survival studies. We report a patient whose IgG anti-Yta was initially shown not to shorten the lifespan of 51Cr-labeled Yt(a+) red cells. At the time of this study, the subclass of the antibody could not be determined. Twelve weeks after transfusion with 4 units of Yt(a+) red cells, the alloantibody for the first time was demonstrable as IgG1; a repeat radiolabeled red cell survival demonstrated significant shortening of the lifespan of Yt(a+) red cells when they were followed for 7 days. These cells had a marked 'two-component' survival curve. Because the patient also demonstrated autoantibody coating his red cells, the clinical effect of this autoantibody was followed with autologous red cells labeled with 111In; the survival of autologous red cells was normal throughout these studies. Evaluation of the clinical significance of an alloantibody in a patient may requi…
12565722	Weak platelet agonists and U46619 induce apoptosis-like events in platelets, in the absence of phosphatidylserine exposure.	aging	2002-09-15	Platelets express apoptotic markers during storage, while aging and after stimulation with strong agonists thrombin and collagen. It is unknown if the weak agonists ADP and epinephrine or U46619, a thromboxane analog, induce the expression of apoptotic markers in platelets. To answer this question, we measured phosphatidylserine exposure, gelsolin cleavage and decrease in membrane mitochondrial potential after stimulation with these agonists. No phosphatidylserine exposure was evident, however, gelsolin cleavage and a platelet population with a decreased membrane mitochondrial potential appeared, suggesting that in platelets selective agonists can induce apoptosis in the absence of phosphatidylserine exposure. Interestingly, costimulation by thrombin plus collagen together with each of the other agonists increased the phosphatidylserine exposure induced by strong agonists. These findings may be of importance in platelet activation and apoptosis under pathophysiological conditions where…
8191924	Diagnostic value of estimated volumetric bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in osteoporosis.	aging	1994-03-??	Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are planar measurements. By measuring planar BMD in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral projections, it is possible to estimate the volumetric BMD by assuming that the vertebral body is an ellipsoid cylinder. Correction for the third dimension could improve the diagnostic accuracy of spinal BMD measurement in osteoporosis. The aims of this study were (1) to determine the effect of aging on volumetric BMD compared to planar measurements; and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of volumetric BMD in comparison to planar measurements. We studied 26 postmenopausal women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 114 age- and sex-matched controls without vertebral fractures from a population-based group. AP and lateral decubitus BMD of the lumbar spine were measured by DXA using a Lunar DPX (precision error for AP measurement, 0.8%; for lateral measurement of vertebra L3, 6.4%). Between the ages of 51 and 85 ye…
10330131	Inventory of high-abundance mRNAs in skeletal muscle of normal men.	aging	1999-05-??	G42875rial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method was used to generate a catalog of 53,875 short (14 base) expressed sequence tags from polyadenylated RNA obtained from vastus lateralis muscle of healthy young men. Over 12,000 unique tags were detected. The frequency of occurrence of each tag reflects the relative abundance of the corresponding mRNA. The mRNA species that were detected 10 or more times, each comprising >/=0.02% of the mRNA population, accounted for 64% of the mRNA mass but <10% of the total number of mRNA species detected. Almost all of the abundant tags matched mRNA or EST sequences cataloged in GenBank. Mitochondrial transcripts accounted for approximately 20% of the polyadenylated RNA. Transcripts encoding proteins of the myofibrils were the most abundant nuclear-encoded mRNAs. Transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins, and those encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, also were very abundant. The database can be used as a reference for investigations of a…
16271918	Proinflammatory state and circulating erythropoietin in persons with and without anemia.	aging	2005-11-??	PURPOSE: High circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines cause anemia, perhaps by interacting with erythropoietin production or biological activity. We characterize the relationships of systemic inflammation, erythropoietin, and hemoglobin.    METHODS: Data are from the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, aging in the Chianti area) study population. A sample of 1270 persons aged 65 years or older and 30 men and 30 women from each age-decade 20 to 70 years were randomly selected from the residents in the Chianti, Italy, geographic area. Of the 1714 eligible persons, 1235 had complete data on inflammatory markers, erythropoietin, hemoglobin, potential causes of anemia, and other relevant covariates. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL in women and less than 13 g/dL in men.    RESULTS: Independent of age, sex, and hemoglobin, the number of elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) was associated…
23605573	Race differentials in partnering patterns among older U.S. men: influence of androgens or religious participation?	aging	2013-10-??	Using nationally representative data from the 2005-2006 U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, this study queried race differences in older men's polyamorous and casual sex, as well as stratification of these patterns by endogenous androgens (testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone) and by regular religious participation. Results suggested that despite their respective prominence in the biomedical and sociological literatures on sex, neither "bottom up" hormonal influences nor "top down" religious social control were major structuring factors for greater lifetime as well as current likelihood of these behaviors among older Black than White men. Androgens were higher among the former, but did not seem to drive these race patterns. Regular church attendance--while negatively associated with non-monogamous and prolific partnering, and hence possibly a social control mechanism among all men--played only a weak role in moderating ethnic variations in these behaviors. It is sp…
20559821	The acute effects of glucose ingestion on attentional control in fasting healthy older adults.	aging	2010-08-??	RATIONALE: Glucose enhancing effects have been observed in older adults mainly for episodic memory, but have been under-investigated for attentional functions, which are very sensitive to aging.    OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the acute effects of glucose ingestion on different attentional tasks in fasting healthy older adults.    METHODS: In a between-subjects design, 44 participants (60 years and older) were randomly assigned to a glucose (50 g) or saccharin (placebo) condition after 12 h of fasting. Participants were tested on neuropsychological tests of attention (trail A and B, modified Stroop) and on a computerized dual-task.    RESULTS: Participants in the glucose group were faster than the placebo group to complete the switching condition of the modified Stroop test (p < 0.01) and showed a smaller dual-task cost in the divided attention task (p < 0.05).    CONCLUSIONS: Glucose ingestion appears to momentarily enhance attentional performances in seniors who have fasted …
8074695	Amino acid polymorphisms of the human L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl methyltransferase involved in protein repair.	aging	1994-08-30	We have analyzed DNA from three exons of the human protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase gene in 30 individuals. We present evidence for two polymorphisms in these regions that result in amino acid changes. At a site corresponding to amino acid position 119, we find the ATA codon for Ile at a frequency of 0.77 and the GTA codon for Val at a frequency of 0.23. At the site corresponding to amino acid position 205, we find the AAG codon for Lys at a frequency of 0.98 and the AGG codon for Arg at a frequency of 0.02. These amino acid changes may affect the ability of this enzyme to recognize and catalyze the first step in the repair of proteins spontaneously damaged in the aging process.
19085396	Effects of chronic and acute smoking on AMLRs in older and younger listeners.	aging	2008-12-??	Chronic and acute smoking effects on the auditory middle latency response (AMLR) were studied in older (55-81 years) and younger (19-30 years) normal-hearing listeners. Forty healthy participants were selected for one of four groups: older smokers, older nonsmokers, younger smokers, or younger nonsmokers. Biochemical urine analyses confirmed participant categorization as smoker or nonsmoker. Click-evoked AMLRs were acquired once from nonsmokers and twice (chronic condition, acute condition) from smokers. Waveform latency (V, Na, Pa) and relative amplitude (V-Na, Na-Pa) were examined with two independent variables (age, smoking) using MANOVA. Results (n=40) revealed no chronic effect of smoking in the AMLR from smokers compared to nonsmokers. However, in both older and younger smokers (n=20), Na-Pa amplitude was significantly larger in the acute compared to the chronic smoking condition, indicating an acute smoking effect. There was no interaction of smoking and aging. This is a first s…
18326955	Biomarkers, age, and coronary artery remodeling in patients with acute coronary syndrome.	aging	????-??-??	To investigate the relationship between age and coronary artery remodeling in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 56 patients with ACS were identified by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Remodeling index (RI) (37 cases of RI > or =1 vs 19 cases of RI <1) and dimidiate age groups (27 patients younger than 60 years vs 29 patients 60 years or older) were compared, and the relationships among biomarkers, age, and arterial remodeling were analyzed. There was a significant difference in age between positive and negative remodeling groups (55+/-13 vs 62+/-10 years; P=.038); RI and triglyceride level showed a statistical correlation (r=0.32; P=.02) and a significant inverse correlation between age and RI (r=-0.47; P<.001). The multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that age was an independent predictor of RI (Bate -0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.08; P=.04). Age may be an important factor of arterial remodeling. Low-density lipoprotein or triglyceride level may be…
7815020	Restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction-HLA DQ alpha analysis of casework urine specimens.	aging	1994-11-??	DNA was isolated from casework urine samples previously submitted for toxicological analysis. The quality and quantity of DNA isolated was determined by spectrofluorometry and agarose yield gel electrophoresis. Hae III restricted samples were then resolved by analytical agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane by Southern blotting and hybridized with a chemiluminescently-labelled (D2S44) probe. The DNA fragment banding patterns were indistinguishable from the DNA banding patterns of blood specimens collected from the same donor. Only 5 of 20 samples yielded banding patterns and the banding intensity relative to background was low. Genomic DNA was also obtained from casework samples by Chelex extraction, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then genotyped for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DQ alpha. Of 20 specimens, 13 (65%) were typed correctly producing identical results for urine and blood specimens obtained from the same donor. Aging studies of casework samp…
2065137	Effect of age on the cortisol response to human corticotropin-releasing hormone in depressed patients pretreated with dexamethasone.	aging	1991-05-15	A combined dexamethasone-human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) test was applied to 63 individuals--44 patients with major depressive episode (22 male, age 49.5 +/- 13.4 years, and 22 female, 44.6 +/- 11.9 years) and 19 normal male controls (age 42.0 +/- 16.8 years). In normal controls, premedication with 1.5 mg dexamethasone at 11:00 PM substantially inhibited the stimulated release (expressed as area under the time course curve) of cortisol on the day after 100 micrograms hCRH was administered at 3:00 PM. In contrast, depressives responded with significant rises in cortisol (normal controls, 4.1 +/- 4.0 x 10(3) ng/ml/min; depressives, 12.7 +/- 8.3 x 10(3) ng/ml/min; p less than 0.01). Multiple stepwise regression analysis disclosed significant effects of age (T = 3.55, p less than 0.01) and severity of depression (T = 5.42, p less than 0.01) on cortisol release in patients. Such an influence of age upon pituitary-adrenocortical regulation was absent among healthy controls. We p…
12084799	Blood-sample processing for the study of age-dependent gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	longevity, aging	2002-07-??	Although most new biogerontological studies seeking to identify longevity candidate genes and factors involved in successful human aging are population based, and likely to involve the collection of blood from extremely old individuals, to our knowledge no unified protocols have yet been published to describe a methodology permitting the simultaneous generation of different kinds of biological specimens derived from a single source of a very small volume of peripheral blood. Here we describe a method permitting the simultaneous generation of plasma, RNA, DNA, protein, fixed lymphocytes, and frozen blood aliquots from a single 10- to 30-ml blood sample obtained from donors of any age (10-102 years old), and we show that the quality and quantity of DNA, RNA, protein, and fixed lymphocytes obtained do not vary significantly with age. As is frequently observed, the older individuals have higher plasma proportions.
15854779	Longitudinal evidence of the impact of normal thyroid stimulating hormone variations on cognitive functioning in very old age.	aging	2005-08-??	The purpose of this study was to examine longitudinal associations among thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and cognitive performance. Data collected at the first three assessment times, approximately 3 years apart, are reported for the survivors (n=45) from a previously published cross-sectional study. Participants were aged 75-93 years at baseline, and data reported were collected in the Kungsholmen Project, a longitudinal project investigating aging and dementia. Analyses revealed that although declining verbal fluency and visuospatial abilities were accompanied by simultaneously declining TSH levels, the pattern of cross-sectional and longitudinal results are interpreted such that declining TSH levels may have caused episodic memory deficits later on. These results were obtained in the examination of 6-year but not 3-year change, and after removal of the cognitive variation associated with depressive mood symptoms.
15240602	Relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone levels at the beginning of the human menstrual cycle, length of the follicular phase and excreted estrogens: the FREEDOM study.	aging	2004-07-??	Although reproductive aging has been separately related to elevated FSH and shorter follicular phase (FP), the direct association between both parameters has not been investigated. Also, the exact effects of increased FSH on estrogen production are yet to be established.A large database of daily urinary concentrations of FSH, LH, and estrone 3-glucuronide (E1G) from 37 regularly menstruating women (median 11 cycles per patient) was used. Initial FSH levels (iFSH) were estimated as the mean value of d 1-5. The day of E1G take-off (ETO) was determined by an algorithm, and accordingly, the FP was divided into early (d 1 to ETO) and late (ETO+1 to LH peak). FP maximum and integrated E1G were calculated. Subjects were distributed according to their mean iFSH into three categories (</=5, >5 to 10, and >10 IU/liter). There was a gradual decrease in FP length with increasing category (15.2 +/- 3.8, 14.1 +/- 3.6, and 13 +/- 2.6 d, respectively; P < 0.0001). A similar effect occurred in early FP…
25633720	Lead exposure and tremor among older men: the VA normative aging study.	aging	2015-05-??	BACKGROUND: Tremor is one of the most common neurological signs, yet its etiology is poorly understood. Case-control studies suggest an association between blood lead and essential tremor, and that this association is modified by polymorphisms in the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase (ALAD) gene.    OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relationship between lead and tremor, including modification by ALAD, in a prospective cohort study, using both blood lead and bone lead-a biomarker of cumulative lead exposure.    METHODS: We measured tibia (n = 670) and patella (n = 672) bone lead and blood lead (n = 807) among older men (age range, 50-98 years) in the VA Normative Aging Study cohort. A tremor score was created based on an approach using hand-drawing samples. ALAD genotype was dichotomized as ALAD-2 carriers or not. We used linear regression adjusted for age, education, smoking, and alcohol intake to estimate the associations between lead biomarkers and tremor score.    RESULTS: In una…
23070370	Functional alteration of the DMN by learned regulation of the PCC using real-time fMRI.	aging	2013-07-??	The default mode network (DMN) is a network of brain regions that are active during rest and suppressed during a cognitively demanding task. Previous studies have shown that the DMN can be altered by development, aging, disorder, cognitive tasks and offline training. However, it's unclear whether activity in the DMN can be altered by real-time training. Recently, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), as a novel neurofeedback technique, has been applied to train subjects to voluntarily control activities in specific brain regions. In the current study, it was found that by using rtfMRI to guide training, subjects were able to learn to decrease activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which is a "key hub" in the DMN, using motor imagery strategy. After the real-time training, activity in the medial prefrontral cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (MPFC/ACC) of the resting state DMN was decreased. By contrast, the control group without neurofeedback produced incr…
11404230	Effect of the GABAA agonist gaboxadol on nocturnal sleep and hormone secretion in healthy elderly subjects.	aging	2001-07-??	Aging is associated with a dramatic decrease in sleep intensity and continuity. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist gaboxadol has been shown to increase non-REM sleep and the duration of the non-REM episodes in rats and sleep efficiency in young subjects and to enhance low-frequency activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-REM sleep in both rats and humans. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the influence of an oral dose of 15 mg of gaboxadol on nocturnal sleep and hormone secretion (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone) in 10 healthy elderly subjects (6 women). Compared with placebo, gaboxadol did not affect endocrine activity but significantly reduced perceived sleep latency, elevated self-estimated total sleep time, and increased sleep efficiency by decreasing intermittent wakefulness and powerfully augmented low-frequency activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep. These findings indicate that gaboxadol is able to increase sleep conso…
3494369	Acute myocardial infarction in the very elderly. A comparison with younger age groups.	aging	1987-??-??	In a consecutive series of 2312 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted from 1973 till 1979, 188 were 80 years or older (group III). They were compared with 1167 patients younger than 65 years (group I) and 957 aged 65 to 79 years (group II). The sex ratio (males/females) fell from 5.46 in group I to 0.9 in group III. Group III patients had more frequently a history of previous heart failure and more often atypical or no chest pain before admission. Less group III patients were admitted within 4 hours after onset of symptoms, but the incidence of heart failure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock on admission and during CCU stay was definitely higher than in younger patients. Atrial arrhythmias, 2nd and 3rd degree atrioventricular block, complete bundle branch block and intraventricular conduction disturbances occurred more frequently in group III. The electrocardiographic extent and location of the infarction and peak enzyme levels were similar in the three groups. …
8730230	Increased vulnerability to alcohol-related birth defects in the offspring of mothers over 30.	aging	1996-04-??	The risk of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is known to increase with increased maternal age and parity. This study investigated the hypothesis that the deficits in growth and intellectual function seen in non-FAS infants exposed to alcohol at moderate-to-heavy levels are also found disproportionately in the offspring of older mothers. Mothers of 480 African-American, inner-city infants were interviewed at each prenatal clinic visit regarding their use of alcohol during pregnancy. Infants were assessed for physical growth and cognitive development repeatedly through age 13 months. In analyses run separately for the infants of younger and older mothers, alcohol-related deficits were seen most strongly in the offspring of women over 30 years of age. This pattern was not caused by lower levels of drinking by the younger mothers. Age-related increases in maternal body fat-to-water ratio and a faster rate of alcohol metabolism in chronic drinking women may account for the greater vulnerability…
24263674	Menopause effect on blood Fe and Cu isotope compositions.	aging	2014-02-??	Iron (δ(56) Fe) and copper (δ(65) Cu) stable isotope compositions in blood of adult human include a sex effect, which still awaits a biological explanation. Here, we investigate the effect of menopause by measuring blood δ(56) Fe and δ(65) Cu values of aging men and women. The results show that, while the Fe and Cu isotope compositions of blood of men are steady throughout their lifetime, postmenopausal women exhibit blood δ(65) Cu values similar to men, and δ(56) Fe values intermediate between men and premenopausal women. The residence time of Cu and Fe in the body likely explains why the blood δ(65) Cu values, but not the δ(56) Fe values, of postmenopausal women resemble that of men. We suggest that the Cu and Fe isotopic fractionation between blood and liver resides in the redox reaction occurring during hepatic solicitation of Fe stores. This reaction affects the Cu speciation, which explains why blood Cu isotope composition is impacted by the cessation of menstruations. Considerin…
22132199	Polymorphisms in genes involved in the NF-κB signalling pathway are associated with bone mineral density, geometry and turnover in men.	aging	2011-??-??	INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within two genes involved in the NF-κB cascade (GPR177 and MAP3K14) and bone mineral density (BMD) assessed at different skeletal sites, radial geometric parameters and bone turnover.    METHODS: Ten GPR177 SNPs previously associated with BMD with genome-wide significance and twelve tag SNPs (r(2)≥0.8) within MAP3K14 (±10 kb) were genotyped in 2359 men aged 40-79 years recruited from 8 centres for participation in the European Male Aging Study (EMAS). Measurement of bone turnover markers (PINP and CTX-I) in the serum and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the calcaneus were performed in all centres. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), at the lumbar spine and hip, and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), at the distal and midshaft radius, were performed in a subsample (2 centres). Linear regression was used to test for association between the SNPs and bone…
16036088	Estrogen, androgen, and the pathogenesis of bone fragility in women and men.	aging	2004-09-??	During growth, estrogen deficiency in females may produce increased bone size as a result of removal of inhibition of periosteal apposition, while failed endosteal apposition produces thin cortices and trabeculae in the smaller bone. In males, androgen deficiency produces reduced periosteal and endosteal apposition, reduced bone size, and cortical and trabecular thickness. At completion of longitudinal growth, advancing age is associated with emergence of a negative bone balance in each basic multicellular unit (BMU) because of reduced bone formation. Bone loss occurs, but slowly because the remodeling rate is slow. In midlife, in females, estrogen deficiency increases remodeling rate, increases the volume of bone resorbed, and decreases the volume of bone formed in each of the numerous BMUs remodeling bone on its endosteal (endocortical, trabecular, intracortical) surfaces so bone loss accelerates. In males, remodeling rate remains slow and is driven largely by reduced bone formation …
17026842	Discrete MBL-MASP complexes show wide inter-individual variability in concentration: data from UK vs Armenian populations.	aging	????-??-??	Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) circulates in plasma in complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) -1, -2 and -3 and a smaller component, MAp19. When MBL binds to the surface of foreign material (microorganisms), MASP-1, -2, -3 are activated. MASP-2 then activates the complement system. MASP-1 and -3 may activate other (unidentified) systems. MBL levels, MBL-bound MASP-1 and MBL-bound MASP-2 activities have been evaluated in healthy individuals from UK and Armenian populations. MBL-bound MASP-2 activity declines in aging (P<0.04). MBL correlates with smoking (P<0.02). There were significant differences between the two populations in MBL-bound MASP-1 activity and in MBL, but no difference in MBL-bound MASP-2 activity. When MASP activities were normalised to MBL (i.e. MASP-1 activity/MBL, MASP-2 activity/MBL), normalised MASP-2 activity in UK individuals was more than 2 fold higher than in Armenians. The difference in normalised MASP-2 activity level between these two Caucasoid popu…
18221800	Homocysteine (Hcy) and cognitive performance in a population sample of elderly Brazilians.	aging	????-??-??	Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) has been suggested as a predictive factor of cognitive alterations. Brazil has one of the highest aging dementia rates among the world's emerging countries. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of Hcy levels on the cognitive performance of low-income elderly. This cross-sectional study was developed in an urban center in the Northeast of Brazil and included 205 eligible community-dwelling older adults. A multidimensional questionnaire was used to evaluate sociodemographic aspects, health status and overall clinical aspects. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Portuguese version of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Folic acid, vitamin B(12) and Hcy levels were determined by chemical luminescence. The association between sociodemographic variables, Hcy, serum vitamin B(12), folic acid levels and total MMSE score was assessed by multiple linear regression. Values indicative of HHcy (>12micromol/l) were found in 34.8% of the individu…
15894835	Moderate regular exercise increases basal production of nitric oxide in elderly women.	aging	2004-12-??	Vascular endothelial cells produce nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator substance and is thought to have antiatherosclerotic properties. Therefore, it has also been proposed that NO may be useful to regulate vascular tonus and prevent progression of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, NO activity reduces with aging. We previously reported that the plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx: the stable end product of NO) concentration was significantly increased by intense aerobic exercise training in healthy young humans. We hypothesized that lifestyle modification (e.g., even mild regular exercise training) can increase NO production in previously sedentary older humans. We measured the plasma NOx concentration before and after a mild aerobic exercise training regimen (cycling on a leg ergometer at 80% ventilatory threshold for 30 min, 5 days/week) for 3 months in elderly women. In addition, we assessed the plasma concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger…
16529575	Quality of life in elderly men with androgen deficiency.	aging	2006-04-??	The partial androgen deficiency in aging male (PADAM) has been of great interest to investigators and the public in the last few years. For males, androgens are said to be essential for the maintenance of quality of life (QoL) but there are no data available with respect to QoL and PADAM yet. In order to evaluate changes of individual well-being of males older than 50 years and with subnormal levels of free testosterone (FT) (<200 pmol l(-1)), these men were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding QoL. The objective of this study was to compare age-matched males with androgen deficiency (group 1; n = 24) and normoandrogenic elderly men (group 2; n = 24) with respect to QoL and somatic indicators of the endocrine status. Participants suffered from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and were hospitalized for prostate surgery. Health-related QoL was assessed by the SF-12 Health Survey, including the physical health index and the mental health index. The SF-12 was enlarged by the scales…
23413885	Modification by hemochromatosis gene polymorphisms of the association between traffic-related air pollution and cognition in older men: a cohort study.	aging	2013-02-15	BACKGROUND: Previous studies found effect modification of associations between traffic-related air pollution and cardiovascular outcomes by polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE). As traffic-related air pollution may impact cognition through effects on cardiovascular health or through mechanisms which may also influence cardiovascular outcomes, we hypothesized that HFE polymorphisms would also modify a previously observed association between traffic-related air pollution exposure and cognition in older men.    METHODS: We considered data from 628 participants of the VA Normative Aging Study. We estimated long term exposure to black carbon (BC), a marker of traffic related air pollution, using a spatio-temporal land use regression model. We assessed cognition using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a test of global function, and performance on a battery of other tests, covering a wide range of domains. We investigated whether variants of HFE C282Y and H63D modified the …
10147691	The effect of dead space on inhaled particle deposition.	aging	1991-??-??	Mathematical models which have been developed to predict the deposition of particles in the conducting airways of the lung require simplified anatomical models of the dimensions and geometry of the bronchial airways.  In order to produce valid deposition predictions, the computed volumes of the conducting airways must be realistic in comparison to anatomical dead space.  This requirement must be met even as the developing lung grows to maturity and then undergoes aging. The effect of these age-related changes on predicted particle deposition efficiencies has not been well studied.  Numerous authors have suggested that differences in lung volumes (total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, dead space and tidal volume) may account for significant variations between predicted or observed particle deposition but no general age-specific relationship has been proposed. New models are proposed to describe changes in dead space as functions of age and body size, and methods to adjust e…
1582797	Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in mature and developing human retinal pigment epithelium.	aging	1992-05-??	Human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contains two genetically distinct forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes that scavenge harmful superoxide anions. Biochemical and immunochemical techniques were used to compare levels of copper-zinc- and manganese-containing forms of SOD (CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD) in human adult and fetal RPE cells. It was found that Mn-SOD activity was higher in adult than fetal RPE cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Immunolocalization of Mn-SOD in cultured RPE cells showed a greater reactivity in the mitochondria of the adult cells. Primary cultures of adult RPE contained cells with various patterns of mitochondria as shown by immunolabeling for Mn-SOD. Adult RPE cells were more resistant to the effects of a superoxide generator, paraquat, which appeared to disrupt mitochondrial integrity as judged by staining with rhodamine 123. These results suggest that high levels of Mn-SOD protect mitochondria from oxidative damage that probably occurs with aging in the RPE.
3766423	Cardiovascular and norepinephrine responses after meal consumption in elderly (older than 75 years) persons with postprandial hypotension and syncope.	aging	1986-10-01	Aging is associated with alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis that impair adaptation to common hypotensive stresses. Postprandial blood pressure (BP) reduction has been described in elderly subjects, but its clinical significance and pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown. We have identified 8 elderly patients with meal-related syncope and large postprandial BP declines. To evaluate the role of sympathetic nervous system activity and insulin in the development of postprandial BP reduction, mean arterial BP, heart rate, plasma catecholamine and insulin responses to a high carbohydrate meal in these 8 syncope patients were compared with those of 7 young and 12 old nonsyncopal controls. By 60 minutes after the meal, mean arterial BP declined an average of 26 mm Hg (p = 0.001) in old syncope patients, in contrast to a decline of 9 mm Hg (p = 0.1) in elderly controls and no change in young controls. Young and old controls had significant, sustained increases in heart rate or plasma no…
8547832	Reproducibility of plasma hormone levels in postmenopausal women over a 2-3-year period.	aging	1995-09-??	We evaluated the reproducibility of plasma hormone levels over time in 79 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 51-69 years at baseline, who were not using postmenopausal hormones. Three blood samples were collected between 1989 and 1992 from each of these women. We assessed plasma levels of estradiol, free estradiol, percentage of free estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, percentage of bioavailable estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and prolactin at each of three sample collections. The means and SD for each of the plasma estrogens, SHBG, and prolactin were similar at each collection. For the androgens, plasma levels tended to decrease over time consistent with an aging effect; decreases with increasing age were statistically significant for androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranged…
21592597	Age- and menopause-related differences in physiological factors of health quality in women aged 35-60.	aging	????-??-??	The purpose of this study was to elucidate using time series analysis age and menopause induced differences in selected health quality related physiological factors. The study was conducted, using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and the NHANES 1999-2002 data, on women aged 35-60. Subjects who had not had surgical menopause, did not use contraceptives, did not smoke, and did not breastfeed during the examination, and did not use contraception and for whom follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (LH) activity was assessed, were included in the study. Menopausal status was defined by months since the last period (<2, 2-12, and >12 months for pre-, peri-, and postmenopause, respectively). The results indicate that postmenopausal women, aged less than 45, are characterized by a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP), an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and a decrease in triglyceride (TG) levels. It was also determine…
20799853	Polychlorinated biphenyls and testosterone: age and congener related correlation approach in heavily exposed males.	aging	2010-07-??	OBJECTIVE: It was aimed to evaluate some fundamental correlations of 15 individual PCB congeners and their sum with serum testosterone level in highly and long-term exposed males with special respect to minimize the interfering effect of age.    METHODS: A total of 834 males from eastern Slovakia (age range of 21-78 years; median, 75th and 90th percentile of 48, 54 and 58 years, respectively) were examined consisting of 432 males from highly polluted area and 402 males from the area of background pollution. In all of them the serum level of 15 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dichlorodiethyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) was measured by gas chomatography/mass spectrometry and total testosterone in serum was measured with the aid of electrochemiluminiscent immunoassay. Pearson's correlation coefficients for each individual PCB congener as well as for Sigma15PCBs with testosterone were assessed in the cohort of all 834 males and also in the cohort of 444 ma…
19113925	Increased bone resorption is associated with higher mortality in community-dwelling men &gt;or=50 years of age: the MINOS study.	aging	2009-06-??	Low BMD, high concentration of 17beta-estradiol (17betaE2), and decreased level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] predict mortality. Our hypothesis is that high levels of biochemical bone turnover markers (BTMs) are independent predictors of mortality in home-dwelling men. In 781 men >or=50 yr of age followed up prospectively for 10 yr, we studied the association of BTMs with mortality after adjustment for confounders including BMD, major osteoporotic fractures, and concentrations of 17betaE2 and 25(OH)D. Men who died had lower BMD and higher BTM levels. In multivariate models, mortality was higher in men with low BMD (lowest quartile) at the total hip, whole body, and ultradistal radius (HR = 1.49-1.70, p < 0.05). After exclusion of the first 3 yr, higher levels (fourth quartile) of bone resorption markers (free and total deoxypyridinoline and urinary and serum type I collagen C-telopeptide) predicted mortality in multivariate models adjusted for age, BMI, smoking habits, alcohol…
19057118	Associations of daily walking steps with calcaneal ultrasound parameters and a bone resorption marker in elderly Japanese women.	aging	2008-11-??	Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters of the calcaneus and bone resorption markers predict osteoporotic fractures. High levels of physical activity have positive effects on bone health. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effects of daily walking activity (number of steps taken), as an outcome of physical activity, on QUS parameters of the calcaneus and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) in elderly Japanese women. The subjects were 113 postmenopausal women aged 60-85 years. The speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and the stiffness index (Stiffness) of the calcaneus were measured with A-1000 (GE-Lunar, USA). Spot urine samples were collected between 09:00 and 10:00, and the levels of urinary DPD were measured. The subjects were instructed to wear a pedometer during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. In univariate analyses, steps/day significantly decreased with aging (r=-0.306, p<0.001). Steps/day showed significant positive corre…
25429990	Testosterone and male cognitive performance in Tsimane forager-horticulturalists.	aging	????-??-??	OBJECTIVE: Testosterone plays a vital role in brain function and behavior. Among humans, age-related decline in testosterone is associated with declining cognitive functioning, and aging men with higher testosterone maintain better cognitive performance. However, most research focuses on industrialized populations with widespread access to formal schooling, high testosterone, and low parasite and pathogen load. We examine whether men's testosterone is associated with cognitive performance among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia despite relatively lower levels of testosterone and higher immune burden.    METHODS: Ninety-four Tsimane men aged 36-86 (median = 49) participated in a cognitive battery (assessing short- and long-term recall, digit span, semantic memory, and visual scan) and provided urine and blood samples to measure testosterone and markers of immune activation. Linear mixed effects regressions were used to model associations between cognitive performance and test…
24097933	Prevalence of and associations with excessive daytime sleepiness in an Australian older population.	aging	2015-03-??	The aim of this research is to estimate the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness in an older population and associations with sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors using a cross-sectional, population-based study. Participants were men (1560) and women (1759), aged 55 to 85 years, enrolled in the Hunter Community Study, a longitudinal study of aging. Measurements were self-reported questionnaires, biochemical measures, and clinical measures. Of the 3319 participants, 3053 participants completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 15.3% overall and this was higher in males. In adjusted multivariate analysis, gender, working full time, body mass index, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale score, and Kessler psychological distress score were associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Given the high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness observ…
22001220	Polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides in plasma of older Canadians.	aging	2011-11-??	No nationwide study has ever measured polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and organochlorine pesticide (OCP) body burden in Canadians aged 65 years and over. The objective of this study was to determine plasma concentrations of PCB congeners and OCPs in participants from a sub-cohort of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging and to examine the effects of socio-demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics on selected organochlorine concentrations. Archived plasma samples collected from 2023 subjects were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization for 15 PCB congeners and 11 OCPs. Descriptive statistics were used to report PCB congeners and OCP plasma concentrations. Multivariate models were used to study whether age at blood collection, sex, education, body mass index, rural residence, geographic region, smoking status and alcohol intake influences PCB 153, the most abundant congener, and the major OCP (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachl…
14718696	Effect of age on MSLT results in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy.	aging	2004-01-13	OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of age on Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)characteristics, sleep latency, and number of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP) in two large populations of narcoleptic patients with similar genetic backgrounds.    METHODS: Clinical and polygraphic information on the severity of the condition was obtained on 236 well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy-human leukocyte antigen DR2-positive patients from Montpellier (France) and on 147 similar patients from Montreal (Canada).    RESULTS: The results show a progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP with age and a progressive increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age. This finding is also related to the severity of cataplexy as assessed from the clinical history with a progressive decrease in the frequency of cataplexy attacks with age. These results may reflect the progressive increase in sleep latency seen in normal aging and suggest that clinical improvement might be due to changes in the…
22915296	A single measurement of serum phylloquinone is an adequate indicator of long-term phylloquinone exposure in healthy older adults.	aging	2012-10-??	Assessment of long-term phylloquinone exposure is challenging in studies investigating vitamin K in health. Data are equivocal as to whether a single measurement of circulating phylloquinone would be adequate. The primary purpose of the present study was to validate the use of a single measurement of serum phylloquinone as a surrogate for long-term phylloquinone exposure in healthy older adults. Using data from the Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging, the objectives were to: 1) determine the reproducibility of circulating phylloquinone over 2 y (n = 234); 2) calculate how a single measurement would rank or classify individuals and attenuate the regression coefficient between circulating phylloquinone and a health outcome; and 3) investigate the association of a single measurement of serum phylloquinone with long-term phylloquinone intakes assessed over the year prior to the blood draw (n = 228). The variance analysis based on 2 blood samples showed a fair to goo…
15129300	Nutritional factors and risk of incident dementia in the PAQUID longitudinal cohort.	aging	2004-??-??	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to present a summary of the results obtained in the PAQUID study regarding wine consumption, fish and seafood consumption and vitamin A and E plasma concentrations.    METHODS: This study was carried out from the PAQUID (Personnes Agees QUID) cohort, an epidemiological study on cognitive and functional aging after 65 years in Southwestern France. The relationship between nutritional factors and risk of incident dementia was measured using logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models on different subsamples of the cohort.    RESULTS: Among 2950 initially non-demented subjects, moderate drinkers had a decreased relative risk of developing a dementia in the subsequent 8 years (RR=0.56) compared to non-drinkers. In a sub-sample of 1416 subjects, those who ate fish or seafood at least once a week had a significant reduced risk of incident dementia adjusted for age and sex (RR=0.66). Lastly, a nested casecontrol study was performed among 182 subje…
4758657	The abnormal lower oesophageal sphincter in pernicious anaemia.	aging	1973-10-??	Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure has been studied in pernicious anaemia patients and controls using an infused open-tipped system. Resting sphincter pressure was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in the pernicious anaemia patients. After gastric acidification with 0.1 N HCl pressure fell significantly (p < 0.01) in both groups. Following subsequent alkalinization, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure for controls rose significantly (p < 0.001). For pernicious anaemia patients the pressure after alkali was not greater than resting levels. Graded intravenous doses of pentagastrin in controls resulted in a peak pressure change of 38.5 +/- 4.9 mm Hg after the 0.8 mug/kg dose. For patients the peak pressure change was only 13.0 +/- 5.2 mm Hg and occurred after 0.4 mug/kg. Cholinergic stimulation with edrophonium (10 mg) produced a peak pressure change of 20.6 +/- 2.6 mm Hg in controls but only 3.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg in pernicious anaemia patients (p < 0.001). In addition, no change in lower oes…
12635727	Methods and rationale for derivation of a reference dose for methylmercury by the U.S. EPA.	aging	2003-02-??	In 2001, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency derived a reference dose (RfD) for methylmercury, which is a daily intake that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. This derivation used a series of benchmark dose (BMD) analyses provided by a National Research Council (NRC) panel convened to assess the health effects of methylmercury. Analyses were performed for a number of endpoints from three large longitudinal cohort studies of the neuropsychological consequences of in utero exposure to methylmercury: the Faroe Islands, Seychelles Islands, and New Zealand studies. Adverse effects were identified in the Faroe Islands and New Zealand studies, but not in the Seychelles Islands. The NRC also performed an integrative analysis of all three studies. The EPA applied a total uncertainty factor (UF) of 10 for intrahuman toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic variability and uncertainty. Dose conversion from cord blood mercury concentrations to maternal m…
26399344	Effects of dietary soy protein on skeletal muscle volume and strength in humans with various physical activities.	aging	2015-??-??	BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of bedridden people is rapidly increasing due to aging or lack of exercise in Japan. This problem is becoming more serious, since there is no countermeasure against it. In the present study, we designed to investigate whether dietary proteins, especially soy, had beneficial effects on skeletal muscle in 59 volunteers with various physical activities.    METHODS: We subjected 59 volunteers with various physical activities to meal intervention examination. Persons with low and high physical activities were divided into two dietary groups, the casein diet group and the soy diet group. They ate daily meals supplemented with 7.8 g of powdered casein or soy protein isolate every day for 30 days. Bedridden patients in hospitals were further divided into three dietary groups: the no supplementation diet group, the casein diet group and the soy diet group. They were also subjected to a blood test, a urinalysis, magnetic resonance imaging analysis and musc…
11896003	Gender influence on vasoactive hormones at rest and during a 70 degrees head-up tilt in healthy humans.	aging	2002-04-??	To evaluate the influence of age and gender on the neuroendocrine control of blood pressure in normal subjects, a 13-min 70 degrees head-up tilt (HUT) was applied after 3 h of recumbency to 109 healthy men and women aged 23-50 yr (age group I) and 51-77 yr (age group II). We found that age and gender had a significant influence on plasma norepinephrine (PNE) concentration at baseline and in the upright position. PNE was significantly higher in older men compared with the younger men and women of both age groups, suggesting a divergent age-related activation of the sympathetic nervous system between genders at baseline as well as during a sustained orthostatic challenge. There was no significant influence of age or gender on plasma epinephrine at baseline or during HUT. Plasma renin activity was significantly higher at baseline as well as in the upright position during HUT in elderly men than in women. Age or gender had no influence on plasma vasopressin (PAVP), and, regardless of age, …
3947640	Evidence that the conformational stability of 'aged' organophosphate-inhibited cholinesterase is altered.	aging	1986-02-14	In order to determine whether a structural modification at the active center of cholinesterase may alter the conformational stability of the enzyme we compared the urea-induced unfolding of the tetrameric form of non-inhibited and irreversibly inhibited human plasma cholinesterase (acylcholine acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.8). We studied enzyme inhibited by methanesulfonyl fluoride, diisopropylfluorophosphonate (DFP) and racemic soman. DFP- and soman-inhibited cholinesterases are converted spontaneously into non-reactivable forms called 'aged' enzymes through a process involving dealkylation of the bound organophosphate residue. The unfolding was followed by transverse urea-gradient polyacrylamide electrophoresis at various temperatures ranging from 0 to 60 degrees C. Unfolding of cholinesterase appears to be a complex process. The denaturation patterns showed that partially unfolded states are thermodynamically unstable, but that several intermediates are involved; the lifetime of these dep…
3028217	A clinical study of sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside during controlled hypotensive anesthesia in young and elderly patients.	aging	1987-02-??	Aging has important effects on the cardiovascular system; baroreceptor reflex function decreases and the elderly are more resistant to both beta-receptor agonists and antagonists. The purpose of the present clinical study was to determine the relationship between age and sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside in 16 patients during deliberate hypotensive anesthesia by determining the blood pressure changes in young and elderly patients to incremental increases in dose of sodium nitroprusside. A dose-response curve relating change in mean blood pressure to dose of sodium nitroprusside (microgram X kg-1 X min-1) was constructed for each patient; the slope of this line is a measure of "sensitivity." The change in mean arterial blood pressure per microgram X kg-1 X min-1 nitroprusside dose (i.e., slope), showed a significant correlation with age (r = 0.766, P less than 0.001), demonstrating that sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside increases with advancing years. The maximum change in heart rat…
19339394	Effect of age and frailty on ghrelin and cholecystokinin responses to a meal test.	aging	2009-05-??	BACKGROUND: Ghrelin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are among the peripheral signals that regulate hunger and satiety.    OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess whether ghrelin and CCK responses to a standard nutritional load are related to age and frailty.    DESIGN: Ghrelin, CCK, insulin, glucose, and 4-h visual analog hunger scale curves after a standard nutritional load test (380 kcal) were described and compared between 3 groups: old (>75 y) and frail persons (group A), old (>75 y) but nonfrail persons (group B), and young (25-65 y) adults (group C).    RESULTS: Frail persons showed no postprandial ghrelin suppression, and old subjects, frail and nonfrail, showed no significant postprandial ghrelin recovery compared with young adults. Frailty was also associated with lower fasting ghrelin concentrations. No differences in fasting CCK were observed between young and old persons; however, postprandial CCK concentrations were enhanced in young persons, whereas no frailty effect on the CCK …
28834253	Appetite-Inducing Effects of Homoeriodictyol: Two Randomized, Cross-Over Interventions.	aging	2017-??-??	SCOPE: Anorexia of aging, characterized by a decrease in appetite and/or food intake, is a major risk factor of under-nutrition and adverse health outcomes in elderly people. Recent in vitro evidence suggests homoeriodictyol (HED), a naturally occurring, bitter-masking flavanone, as a promising agent to increase appetite and food intake.    METHODS AND RESULTS: In two cross-over intervention trials, 30 mg NaHED, either solely (n = 10, Study I) or in combination with a 75 g glucose load (n = 17, study II) were administered to healthy adult subjects. Ratings of hunger were assessed at fasting and either 30 min (Study I) or 120 min (Study II) post intervention. Ad libitum energy intake from a standardized breakfast and plasma changes in hunger-/satiety-associated hormones PYY, GLP-1, ghrelin and serotonin were determined after blood drawings. Effects were more pronounced when NaHED was administered in combination with 75 g glucose since ad libitum energy (+ 9.52 ± 4.60%) and protein (+ 7.…
11256567	Hematological parameters in high altitude residents living at 4,355, 4,660, and 5,500 meters above sea level.	aging	2000-??-??	There have been a number of reports describing the hematological indicators of Andean residents living at altitudes above 4,000 m, but several confounding factors have made the published results difficult to interpret. To clear up the effect of hypoxia on hemoglobin concentration (Hb, g/dL), hematocrit (Hct, %) and red blood cell concentration (RBC, cells/microL), this publication describes and analyzes these variables in children, men, and women from three large and homogeneous populations living at 4,355 m (n = 151), 4,660 m (n = 400), and 5,500 m (n = 273) in the Southern Peruvian Andes. Hb, Hct, and RBC increase with age in men (p < 0.001), as well as in women (p < 0.001) at the three altitudes of the study. In children (boys and girls) living at 5,500, Hb increases 11% when compared with children living at 4,355 m, and in adults, Hb increases 9.6% when comparing the same altitudes. The maximum percentage increase in Hb with age was 5.6% at 5,500 m, in men and 3.2% at 4,355 m, in w…
11219480	Pharmacokinetics of levormeloxifene in young versus elderly postmenopausal women.	aging	2001-01-??	BACKGROUND: Physiologic changes of aging may affect processes of drug absorption and distribution, in some cases necessitating age-dependent dose adjustment.    OBJECTIVE: The possibility of age dependence in the pharmacokinetic behavior and tolerability of levormeloxifene was investigated in a single-center, open-label study.    METHODS: The study comprised 2 groups of healthy postmenopausal women: group A included younger subjects (50-60 years) and group B included elderly subjects (> or = 66 years). All subjects received a single 40-mg tablet of levormeloxifene base. Blood samples were collected immediately before drug intake and at several points after administration, through day 34. Peak plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curves from zero to the last quantifiable value and to infinity, and terminal half-life were calculated for levormeloxifene and compared between age groups.    RESULTS: Of 29 subjects enrolled, 28 …
26482692	Vitamin K Status Is not Associated with Cognitive Decline in Middle Aged Adults.	aging	2015-11-??	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the association between dephospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), an indicator of vitamin K status, and cognitive decline, and the modifying role of 25(OH)D.    DESIGN: Longitudinal study with six years follow-up.    SETTING: Community based.    PARTICIPANTS: 599 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (aged 55-65 years).    MEASUREMENTS: Information processing speed and a composite Z-score by combining three domains of cognition reflecting general cognitive functioning.    RESULTS: Generalized estimating equations (GEE) showed no significant associations between dp-ucMGP and decline in general cognitive functioning. Vitamin D modified the association between dp-ucMGP and speed of information processing (p<0.05). In the group with a 25(OH)D concentration > 50 nmol/l, the highest tertile of dp-ucMGP (>406 pmol/l), which corresponds to lower vitamin K levels, was associated with 1.5 higher score on information …
18288320	Polychlorinated biphenyl exposure and neuropsychological status among older residents of upper Hudson River communities.	aging	2008-02-??	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may accelerate the cognitive and motor dysfunction found in normal aging, but few studies have examined these outcomes and PCB exposure among older adults.    OBJECTIVE: We evaluated neuropsychological status and low-level PCB exposure among older adults living along contaminated portions of the upper Hudson River in New York.    METHODS: A total of 253 persons between 55 and 74 years of age were recruited and interviewed, and provided blood samples for congener-specific PCB analysis. Participants also underwent a neuropsychological battery consisting of 34 tests capable of detecting subtle deficits in cognition, motor function, affective state, and olfactory function.    RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, the results indicated that an increase in serum total PCB concentration from 250 to 500 ppb (lipid basis) was associated with a 6.2% decrease in verbal learning, as measured by California Verbal Learning Test trial 1 scor…
1651456	Intrathecal immune response in patients with the post-polio syndrome.	aging	1991-09-12	BACKGROUND: The syndrome of progressive muscular atrophy decades after acute paralytic poliomyelitis (post-polio syndrome) is not well understood. The theory that physiologic changes and aging cause the new weakness does not explain the immunologic abnormalities reported in some patients. An alternative explanation is persistent or recurrent poliovirus infection.    METHODS: We assessed the intrathecal antibody response to poliovirus and intrathecal production of interleukin-2 and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome and 67 controls (including 13 who had had poliomyelitis but had no new symptoms and 18 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Intrathecal antibody responses to measles, mumps, herpes simplex, and varicella zoster viruses were also determined.    RESULTS: Oligoclonal IgM bands specific to poliovirus were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 of the 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome (58 percent) but in none of the control group…
21414889	Prospective cohort study of lead exposure and electrocardiographic conduction disturbances in the Department of Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study.	aging	2011-07-??	BACKGROUND: No studies have examined the association between cumulative low-level lead exposure and the prospective development of electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, which may mediate the association between lead and several cardiovascular end points.    OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the association between lead exposure and the development of electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities.    METHODS: We assessed blood lead, bone lead--a biomarker of cumulative lead exposure--measured with K-shell X-ray fluorescence, and electrocardiographic end points among 600 men in the Normative Aging Study who were free of electrocardiographic abnormalities at the time of the baseline ECG. Of these men, we had follow-up data from a second electrocardiogram for 496 men 8.1 (SD = 3.1) years later, on average. We used repeated measures linear regression to analyze change in electrocardiographic conduction timing and logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confiden…
12544381	Influence of DHEA administration on 24-hour cortisol concentrations.	aging	2003-02-??	DHEA is marketed and readily available as a daily nutritional supplement to counteract the effects of aging. The effect of DHEA administration on 24-hour plasma cortisol profiles has not been investigated. In this single-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, the effect of DHEA administration on cortisol concentrations was evaluated in healthy older women and men. Once each morning, subjects took either placebo (Days 1 to 7, and 23 to 29) or oral DHEA 200 mg (Days 8 to 22: doses 1 to 15). Twenty-four hour DHEA and cortisol concentrations were measured on Day 1 (placebo), Day 8 (DHEA dose 1), Day 15 (DHEA dose 8), Day 22 (DHEA dose 15), and Day 29 (placebo washout dose 7). DHEA administration resulted in a decrease in plasma cortisol concentrations (mean, peak, and/or AUC) in healthy older women and men. The cortisol-lowering effect of DHEA was more pronounced in women than in men in our study; pairwise differences in concentrations between days showed that relative to Day 1, cortiso…
20511582	Stressors over the life course and neuroendocrine system dysregulation in Costa Rica.	longevity, aging	2010-09-??	OBJECTIVE: A key aspect of the increasingly popular allostatic load (AL) framework is that stressors experienced over the entire life course result in physiological dysregulation. Although core to AL theory, this idea has been little tested, and where it has been tested, the results have been mixed.    METHOD: The study analyzes the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), a new, cross-sectional, and nationally representative survey of older Costa Rican men and women (aged between 60 and 109 years). The survey period is between 2004 and 2006, and the survey has a sample size of 2,827 individuals. This article focuses on the relationship between a variety of stressors experienced over the life course and cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), epinephrine, and norepinephrine analyzed separately and in an index.    RESULTS: There are some links between certain stressors and worse cortisol levels, but overall, almost all of the stressors examined are not associ…
20182059	A cross-sectional community study of serum iron measures and cognitive status in older adults.	aging	2010-??-??	The relationship of iron status with cognition and dementia risk in older people is contentious. We have examined the longitudinal relationship between serum ferritin and cognition in 800 community-dwelling Australians 60 years or older. Iron studies (serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin) were performed in 1994/5 and 2003/4 and clinical and cognitive assessments were conducted in 2003/4 for 800 participants of the Busselton Health Study. All participants completed the Cambridge Cognitive test (CAMCOG). Those with CAMCOG scores <84 underwent expert clinical review for cognitive disorders, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Mean serum iron (18.3 micromol/l) and transferrin saturation (28.5%) in 2003/4 did not differ significantly from 1994/5 whereas mean serum ferritin decreased from 162 microg/l in 1994/5 to 123 microg/l in 2003/4, possibly reflecting aging or dietary changes. No relationships were observed between serum iron or transferrin saturation and presen…
24210171	Toxic and essential elements in children's blood (&lt;6 years) from Kinshasa, DRC (the Democratic Republic of Congo).	aging	2014-01-??	In this study we determined the concentration of 9 trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Se and Zn) in whole blood of children (n=100, 64 girls, 36 boys and median age: 36 months) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The proportion of children potentially deficient in essential elements or poisoned by toxic elements was evaluated. The aging effects on the concentration of these elements were also investigated. The median values were 3.17μg/L (As), 0.15μg/L (Cd), 1.1mg/L (Cu), 2.1μg/L (Hg), 10.4μg/L (Mn), 17.7μg/L (Mo), 8.7μg/dL (Pb), 10.7μg/L (Se) and 5.0mg/L (Zn). The concentration of many elements (As, Cd, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn) showed significant age variations but not sex influence. Regarding levels of the essential elements (Cu, Mn, Mo, Se and Zn), B-Cu, B-Mn, B-Se and B-Zn were in the normal range, whereas exceeded levels were observed for B-Mo. None of these children was deficient in essential elements. Except B-Cd, all toxic elements showed exceeded bl…
26398357	Assessment of fractional excretion of urea for early diagnosis of cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury.	aging	2015-11-??	BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after cardiac surgery (CS). Recently, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was shown to predict AKI development earlier than serum creatinine, but it is not widely used in clinical practice. Fractional excretion of urea (FeU) has been referred to as a useful tool to discriminate between prerenal and established AKI. The aim of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FeU, in the early diagnosis of AKI in patients undergoing CS.    METHODS: We performed a prospective study on adults undergoing CS. AKI was defined by AKIN criteria. Individuals suffering from CKD, were excluded. Sensitivity and specificity of FeU, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and urine NGAL, measured at 1, 6 and 24 h following CS, were assessed.    RESULTS: We included 66 patients (26% female) aging 68 ± 11 years. AKI prevalence was 24% and mortality was 3.28%. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower FeU compared to…
16567585	Polymorphism in endothelin-related genes limits exercise-induced decreases in arterial stiffness in older subjects.	aging	2006-05-??	Increase in arterial stiffness is associated with aging, which is improved by regular exercise. Endothelin (ET) system has crucial roles in regulating vascular tone and in the progression of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that molecular variations (ie, gene polymorphisms) in ET-related gene might affect exercise-induced improvement in arterial stiffness with age in human subjects. The present study provides a cross-sectional investigation of 191 healthy middle-aged and older (65+/-1 years) human subjects to clarify the relationship between the regular exercise-induced improvement of arterial stiffness and the gene polymorphisms of ET converting enzyme (ECE)-1, ECE-2, ET-A receptor (ET-A), and ET-B receptor (ET-B). The study subjects were divided into active and inactive groups based on the median value (186 kcal/d) of energy expenditure. Brachial-ankle arterial pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was used to evaluate arterial stiffness. All individuals were genotyped for 4 different polymorp…
18165401	Symptoms in the menopausal transition: hormone and behavioral correlates.	aging	2008-01-??	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of headache, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, and concentration difficulties with menopausal stage and with reproductive hormones in the menopausal transition.    METHODS: Women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study were assessed longitudinally for 9 years. Data were obtained from structured interviews, a validated symptom questionnaire, menstrual bleeding dates, and early follicular hormone measures of estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone. Menopausal stages were based on menstrual bleeding patterns. Other risk factors included history of depression, perceived stress, premenstrual syndrome, current smoking, age, and race. Generalized linear regression models for repeated measures were used to estimate associations among the variables with each symptom.    RESULTS: Headache decreased in the transition to menopause and was significantly associated with menopausal stage in univariable analysis (P=.002). Mood swings were i…
16454556	Hyperleptinemia as a risk factor for high blood pressure in the elderly.	aging	2006-02-??	CONTEXT: Studies have demonstrated that high serum leptin levels are associated with aging. However, we do not know whether hyperleptinemia is a relevant risk factor for high blood pressure (HBP) in the elderly.    OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between hyperleptinemia and HBP in the elderly.    DESIGN: A comparative cross-sectional study was carried out in a convenience sample of 70 healthy elderly persons comprising 46 women (mean age, 67 +/- 5.8 years) and 24 men (mean age, 73 +/- 7.5 years), and a group of 91 elderly persons with HBP, comprising 62 women (mean age, 67 +/- 8.2 years) and 29 men (mean age, 70 +/- 0.3 years). We measured serum leptin levels through the radioimmunoassay method.    RESULTS: The elderly subjects with HBP had significantly higher leptin levels than the healthy elderly subjects (P = .02). Furthermore, in female elderly subjects we observed a statistically significant correlation between systolic blood pressure and leptin (r = 0.37, P = .003), as …
20167578	Large-scale genomic studies reveal central role of ABO in sP-selectin and sICAM-1 levels.	aging	2010-05-01	P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) participate in inflammatory processes by promoting adhesion of leukocytes to vascular wall endothelium. Their soluble levels have been associated with adverse cardiovascular events. To identify loci affecting soluble levels of P-selectin (sP-selectin) and ICAM-1 (sICAM-1), we performed a genome-wide association study in a sample of 4115 (sP-selectin) and 9813 (sICAM-1) individuals of European ancestry as a part of The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genome Epidemiology consortium. The most significant SNP association for sP-selectin was within the SELP gene (rs6136, P = 4.05 x 10(-61)) and for sICAM-1 levels within the ICAM-1 gene (rs3093030, P = 3.53 x 10(-23)). Both sP-selectin and sICAM-1 were associated with ABO gene variants (rs579459, P = 1.86 x 10(-41) and rs649129, P = 1.22 x 10(-15), respectively) and in both cases the observed associations could be accounted for by the A1 allele of the ABO blood group. The abse…
22523363	At 68 years, unrecognised sleep apnoea is associated with elevated ambulatory blood pressure.	aging	2012-09-??	After the age of 65 yrs the specific impact of unrecognised sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) on 24-h blood pressure (BP) levels remains under debate. We tested the cross-sectional relationship between the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea (OSAH) and the increase of BP using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in the PROOF (PROgnostic indicator OF cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events study)-SYNAPSE (Autonomic Nervous System Activity, Aging and Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea study) cohort. 470 subjects (aged 68 yrs) neither treated for hypertension nor diagnosed for SRBD were included. All subjects underwent ABPM, and unattended at-home polygraphic studies. OSAH was defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) >15 · h(-1). The severity of the sleep apnoea was also quantified as the index of dips in oxyhaemoglobin saturation >3% (ODI). Results are expressed in per protocol analysis. Severe OSAH (AHI >30 · h(-1), 17% of subjects) was associated with a significant 5 mmHg increase …
16790837	Do biomarkers of stress mediate the relation between socioeconomic status and health?	aging	2006-07-??

21169033	Interaction between GSTM1 genotype and IL-6 on mortality in older adults: results from the ilSIRENTE study.	aging	2011-03-??	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The inflammatory process is related to oxidative stress and inflammation was proven to be a strong determinant of the aging process and to ultimately lead to death. The aim of the present study was to assess if, in a population of older adults, the effect of antioxidant genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes on mortality may differ depending on levels of inflammation.    METHODS: Data are from 353 older persons aged ≥80 years enrolled in the ilSIRENTE study. Study population was divided into two groups computed based on the median value of serum IL-6 (low IL-6, n=177 and high IL-6, n=176). All participants were followed up for 48 months.    RESULTS: Mean age of study participants was 85.8 years (Standard Deviation 4.8), 235 (66.6%) were women. Overall 48/177 participant (27.1%) in the low IL-6 group died during the study period, compared with 97/176 (55.1%) in the high IL-6 group (p<0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, GSTM1 wildtype had no effect on mortali…
18978104	Association of change in estradiol to lower urinary tract symptoms during the menopausal transition.	aging	2008-11-??	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship between changes in estradiol (E2) levels over time and lower urinary tract symptoms in premenopausal women as they transition to menopause.    METHODS: A self-administered validated questionnaire to measure lower urinary tract symptoms was administered to 300 women at the 11th assessment period on an ongoing longitudinal Penn Ovarian Aging cohort study. The association between the change in E2 over time through the menopausal transition and lower urinary tract symptoms (urinary incontinence, filling symptoms, voiding dysfunction) was determined. Risk factors associated with lower urinary tract symptoms were determined by univariable analysis and multivariable linear regression.    RESULTS: Estradiol levels and menopausal stage at one point in time were not associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Women with a sharp decline in E2 levels over time had significantly lower urinary incontinence scores in comparison with women without a change in …
17765933	Opposing influences of emotional and non-emotional distracters upon sustained prefrontal cortex activity during a delayed-response working memory task.	aging	2008-01-15	Performance in delayed-response working memory (WM) tasks is typically associated with sustained activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) that spans the delay between the memoranda and the memory probe. Recent studies have demonstrated that novel distracters presented during the delay interval both affect sustained activation and impair WM performance. However, the effect of the performance-impairing distracters upon sustained dlPFC delay activity was related to the characteristics of the distracters: memoranda-confusable distracters increased delay activity, whereas memoranda-nonconfusable emotional distracters decreased delay activity. Because these different effects were observed in different studies, it is possible that different dlPFC regions were involved and the paradox is more apparent than real. To investigate this possibility, event-related fMRI data were recorded while subjects performed a WM task for faces with memoranda-confusable (novel faces) and memorand…
18386990	Homeostatic cytokines and expansion of regulatory T cells accompany thymic impairment in children with Down syndrome.	aging	2008-06-??	Down syndrome (DS), the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans, is characterized by precocious immunologic aging that results, among other things, in alterations of B and T lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cells, defective phagocytosis, and chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We studied 30 children affected by DS, compared them to 29 healthy controls, and evaluated the functionality of the thymus (by measuring the amount of lymphocytes that express the signal-joint T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles [sj-TREC+]), the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-15, the proliferative T cell response to these cytokines, the expression of the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (CD127), the extrathymic differentiation of T lymphocytes, and the presence of natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood. We found that DS children had a significantly lower number of sj-TREC+ lymphocytes, the levels of which were strongly correlated with age. We found higher …
26424830	Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Related to Disability Among Older Adults.	aging	2016-??-??	BACKGROUND: Disability is a crucial health problem in aging. Identifying a biological contributory factor would be useful. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays an important role in the endocrine system and is associated with frailty. However, there is no consensus about the relationship between IGF-1 and disability. This study aimed to examine whether IGF-1 related to incident disability among older adults.    METHODS: The study included 4,133 older adults (mean age, 71.8±5.4 years) who were participants in the "Obu Study of Health Promotion for the Elderly" cohort study. We collected information on demographic variables, measured gait speed, Mini Mental State Examination score, and serum IGF-1 at baseline. During follow-up, incident disability was monitored by Long-Term Care Insurance certification.    RESULTS: Disability was observed in 212 participants during a mean follow-up duration period of 29.2 months. A log rank test indicated that lower levels of serum IGF-1 were …
18227369	Beta2-microglobulin for risk stratification of total mortality in the elderly population: comparison with cystatin C and C-reactive protein.	aging	2008-01-28	BACKGROUND: The clinicoepidemiologic relevance of moderately elevated concentrations of circulating beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M) has not been established.    METHODS: We examined whether serum beta(2)-M concentration independently predicts total mortality in community-dwelling older populations and compared its predictive value with that of cystatin C and C-reactive protein (CRP) using a prospective cohort study of 1034 initially nondisabled persons 65 years and older as part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Study on Aging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine independent associations between baseline beta(2)-M levels and total mortality.    RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.9 years, 223 persons died. A strong dose-response relationship was found between baseline serum beta(2)-M concentration and mortality risk, even after multiple adjustments. Compared with individuals in the lowest tertile of serum beta(2)-M …
19365800	Neural correlates of word production stages delineated by parametric modulation of psycholinguistic variables.	aging	2009-11-??	Word production is a complex multistage process linking conceptual representations, lexical entries, phonological forms and articulation. Previous studies have revealed a network of predominantly left-lateralized brain regions supporting this process, but many details regarding the precise functions of different nodes in this network remain unclear. To better delineate the functions of regions involved in word production, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain areas where blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to overt picture naming were modulated by three psycholinguistic variables: concept familiarity, word frequency, and word length, and one behavioral variable: reaction time. Each of these variables has been suggested by prior studies to be associated with different aspects of word production. Processing of less familiar concepts was associated with greater BOLD responses in bilateral occipitotemporal regions, reflecting visual …
21713302	Is HIV-1 infection associated with endothelial dysfunction in a population of African ancestry in South Africa?	aging	????-??-??	The chronic infection status suffered by HIV-infected individuals promotes chronic arterial inflammation and injury, which leads to dysfunction of the endothelium, atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Although HIV-1 subtype C is prevalent in South Africa and accounts for almost a third of the infections worldwide, this subtype differs genetically from HIV-1 subtype B on which the majority of studies have been done. The objective of this study was to assess whether newly identified, never-treated, HIV-1-infected South African participants showed signs of endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis and increased blood coagulation. We compared 300 newly diagnosed (never antiretroviraltreated) HIV-infected participants to 300 age-, gender-, body mass index- and locality-matched uninfected controls. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion mole…
18245760	Inflammation and rate of cognitive change in high-functioning older adults.	aging	2008-01-??	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory proteins including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with incident cognitive impairment, but little research has addressed their effects on the rate of cognitive change, and findings are mixed. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between serum levels of IL-6 and CRP and the rate of cognitive change across a range of cognitive domains in a sample of healthy older persons.    METHODS: Growth curve analysis was performed on data from the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, a longitudinal cohort study of high-functioning older adults aged 70-79 years at baseline in 1988 and reinterviewed in 1991 and 1995 (N = 851). Individual growth curve parameters were derived from baseline and follow-up performance in abstraction, language, spatial ability, verbal recall, spatial recognition, and global cognitive function based on age, IL-6, CRP, and covariates.    RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, there is a generally linear…
25614177	Secondary hyperparathyroidism and its relationship with sarcopenia in elderly women.	aging	????-??-??	Low dietary intake of calcium and poor vitamin D status during aging can result in mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, which may be associated with low muscle mass and reduced strength in the elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether low vitamin D, high parathormone (PTH), or both, are associated with sarcopenia. A total of 105 women, 35 with sarcopenia and 70 without sarcopenia, were enrolled in the present study. Body composition measurements were performed by DXA and sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle mass index<5.45 kg/m2 and grip strength lower than 20 kg. Three-day dietary records were taken and adjustments for energy intake made. The estimated average requirement (EAR) method was adopted as a cut-off point for estimating the prevalence of inadequate intake. Serum total calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, intact PTH, and 25(OH)D were measured. Only 1% of the patients met the daily adequate intake for vitamin D and 11% met the daily adequate intake for calcium.…
22674205	Quantification of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in dried blood spots: validation of a minimally invasive method for assessing ovarian reserve.	aging	2012-08-??	BACKGROUND: Biological markers of ovarian reserve have the potential to advance research on fecundability, infertility and reproductive aging. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has emerged as a clinically useful measure of ovarian reserve, but the requirement for venous blood is an obstacle to application in non-clinical settings. This paper validates a new method for quantifying AMH in dried blood spot (DBS) samples--drops of whole blood collected on filter paper following a simple finger stick.    METHODS: Matched serum and DBS samples were obtained from n=101 women of reproductive age, and AMH values were compared using regression analyses and scatter plots. The precision, reliability, linearity, recovery and lower detection limit of the DBS assay were evaluated, as well as the stability of AMH in DBS across a range of storage conditions.    RESULTS: There was a strong agreement between AMH concentrations measured in DBS and serum samples across the entire assay range. Analysis of within…
26259504	Detection of red blood cell antibodies in mitogen-stimulated cultures from patients with hereditary spherocytosis.	aging	2015-12-??	BACKGROUND: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a congenital hemolytic anemia caused by defects in red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins leading to premature RBC clearance in the spleen. The presence of RBC autoantibodies has never been extensively investigated in HS.    STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RBC antibody-bound immunoglobulin (Ig)G was investigated in 91 consecutive HS patients by mitogen-stimulated direct antiglobulin test (MS-DAT), a sensitive method able to magnify latent RBC antibody autoimmunity and related with hemolytic variables, previous splenectomy, and type of membrane defect.    RESULTS: A total of 61% of HS cases had RBC antibodies by MS-DAT (29 Band 3, 17 spectrin deficiency, and nine no defined defect). The amount of RBC-bound IgG was greater in HS compared with controls (236 ± 192 ng/mL vs. 52 ± 29 ng/mL, p < 0.0001), although lower than that observed in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA; 634 ± 371 ng/mL vs. 236 ± 192 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). Western blot experiments showe…
17468751	Anticipation of monetary gain but not loss in healthy older adults.	aging	2007-06-??	Although global declines in structure have been documented in the aging human brain, little is known about the functional integrity of the striatum and prefrontal cortex in older adults during incentive processing. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether younger and older adults differed in both self-reported and neural responsiveness to anticipated monetary gains and losses. The present study provides evidence for intact striatal and insular activation during gain anticipation with age, but shows a relative reduction in activation during loss anticipation. These findings suggest that there is an asymmetry in the processing of gains and losses in older adults that may have implications for decision-making.
29741413	Association Between Immigration History and Inflammatory Marker Profiles Among Older Adult Mexican Americans.	aging	????-??-??	Foreign-born Hispanics have better cardiometabolic health upon arrival in the US than their US-born counterparts, yet this advantage diminishes as duration of residence in the US increases. Underlying mechanisms explaining this paradox have been understudied. Using data from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA), this study examined immigration history (immigrant generation and duration of US residence) in relation to biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble forms of type 1 and 2 receptors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2), C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, adiponectin) in a sample of 1,290 predominantly Mexican-origin immigrants. Second and ≥3rd generation immigrants had higher IL-6 and leptin levels than 1st generation immigrants living in the US for less than 15 years (2nd generation percent difference = 45.9; 95% CI: 24.7, 70.7 and 3rd generation percent difference = 41.8; 95% CI: 17.7, 70.4). CRP and sTNF-R1 levels were higher among …
26318628	Sex differences in effective fronto-limbic connectivity during negative emotion processing.	aging	2015-12-??	BACKGROUND: In view of the greater prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women than in men, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have examined sex-differences in brain activations during emotion processing. Comparatively, sex-differences in brain connectivity received little attention, despite evidence for important fronto-limbic connections during emotion processing across sexes. Here, we investigated sex-differences in fronto-limbic connectivity during negative emotion processing.    METHODS: Forty-six healthy individuals (25 women, 21 men) viewed negative, positive and neutral images during an fMRI session. Effective connectivity between significantly activated regions was examined using Granger causality and psychophysical interaction analyses. Sex steroid hormones and feminine-masculine traits were also measured.    RESULTS: Subjective ratings of negative emotional images were higher in women than in men. Across sexes, significant activations were obser…
23756581	Immunological response in egg-sensitive adults challenged with cheese containing or not containing lysozyme.	aging	2012-12-??	OBJECTIVE: Lysozyme is an enzyme that hydrolyzes bacterial peptidoglicans. For this reason, it is used in cheese manufacturing in order to prevent a defect of long-ripened hard cheese called "late blowing" due to the outgrowth of spores of Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Clostridium butyricum. Moreover, germination of Listeria monocytogenes spores into vegetative cells is also sensitive to lysozyme. The enzyme can be an allergenic molecule, and for this reason there are concerns about its use in food industry. The immunological and clinical response of consumption of lysozyme-containing cheese has been evaluated in 25 egg-sensitive subjects with or without lysozyme sensitization.    METHODS: A total of 25 egg-sensitive subjects were enrolled in this study. All the subjects were already treated for egg-sensitization and presented a positive skin prick test. All the subjects had a body mass index ≤ 25 kg/m(2) and were in the age range of 20-50 years. Each subject was studied twice and rece…
18593275	Carotenoids as protection against disability in older persons.	aging	2008-06-??	The purpose was to examine the relationship of total plasma carotenoids, an indicator of fruit and vegetable intake, with walking speed and severe walking disability in older adults. Nine hundred twenty-eight men and women aged 65 to 102 years from the Invecchiare in Chianti (Aging in the Chianti Area [InCHIANTI]) study, a population-based cohort in Tuscany, Italy, were studied. Plasma carotenoids were measured at enrollment (1998-2000), and walking speed over 4 meters and 400 meters distance were assessed at enrollment and 6 years later (2004-2006). At enrollment, 85 of 928 (9.2%) participants had severe walking disability (defined as being unable to walk or having a walking speed at the 4-meter walking test < 0.4 m/sec). After adjusting for potential confounders, participants with high total plasma carotenoids were significantly less likely to have prevalent severe walking disability (odds ration [OR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.90, p = 0.01) and had higher walking spee…
27528110	Abnormal effective fronto-limbic connectivity during emotion processing in schizophrenia.	aging	2017-??-04	BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with core emotional dysfunctions. At the neural level, functional neuro-imaging studies have highlighted fronto-limbic alterations during emotion processing in schizophrenia, as well as impaired connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. However, the direction of the impaired fronto-limbic connections remains largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we performed an effective connectivity study on emotion processing in schizophrenia.    METHODS: Forty-one healthy individuals and 39 schizophrenia patients (DSM-IV criteria) viewed negative, positive and neutral images during an fMRI session. Effective connectivity between significantly activated regions was examined using Granger causality and psychophysical interaction analyses.    RESULTS: Subjective ratings of emotionally neutral images were higher in schizophrenia patients than in controls. Across groups, significant activations were observed in the dorso-medial prefrontal corte…
18022742	Neuroendocrine biomarkers, social relations, and the cumulative costs of stress in Taiwan.	aging	2008-02-??	Allostatic load (AL) is thought to represent the physiological toll that builds up over the life course as a consequence of the body's response to stress. An important aim of this paper is to test this widely held-but little investigated-understanding of what AL represents. More specifically, using the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), a nationally representative survey of Taiwan conducted in year 2000, this paper scrutinizes the connection between stressful life histories and neuroendocrine allostatic load (NAL). Stressful life histories are operationalized through the use of two sets of indicators: one set makes use of respondents' subjective interpretations of various life domains and the other makes use of non-subjective data about conditions that are expected to be stressful (e.g., widowhood, living alone, and low education). NAL is an index of four neuroendocrine biomarkers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), epinephrine, and norepinephrine)…
28760247	Psychometric Evaluation of the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire Short Form (HIS-Q-SF).	aging	2017-??-??	BACKGROUND: The Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire Short Form (HIS-Q-SF) is a patient-reported outcome measurement designed to evaluate the symptoms of hypogonadism. The HIS-Q-SF is an abbreviated version including17 items from the original 28-item HIS-Q.    AIM: To conduct item analyses and reduction, evaluate the psychometric properties of the HIS-Q-SF, and provide guidance on score interpretation.    METHODS: A 12-week observational longitudinal study of hypogonadal men was conducted as part of the original HIS-Q psychometric evaluation. Participants completed the original HIS-Q every 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected to evaluate testosterone levels. Participants completed the Aging Male's Symptoms Scale, the International Index of Erectile Function, the Short Form-12, and the PROMIS Sexual Activity, Satisfaction with Sex Life, Sleep Disturbance, and Applied Cognition Scales (baseline and weeks 6 and 12). Clinicians completed the Clinical Global Impression of Severity…

UNLABELLED: To investigate whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) protein levels predict all-cause mortality in older persons living in the community.    DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.    SETTING: Data were from the Aging and Longevity Study in the Sirente Geographic Area, a prospective cohort study.    PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 80 and older living in an Italian mountain community (N = 362).    MEASUREMENTS: Participants were classified according to the median value of the three inflammation markers (IL-6, 2.08 pg/mL; TNF-α, 1.43 pg/mL; CRP, 3.08 mg/L). A composite summary score of inflammation was also created. The main outcome was risk of death after 4 years of follow-up.    RESULTS: One hundred fifty deaths occurred during 4 years of follow-up. In the unadjusted model, high levels of each of the three markers were associated with greater mortality. After adjusting for potential confounders, high levels of IL-6 (hazard r…
21481714	Serum vitamin E concentrations among highly functioning hip fracture patients are higher than in nonfracture controls.	aging	2011-03-??	Malnutrition after hip fracture is common and associated with poor outcomes and protracted recovery. Low concentrations of vitamin E have been associated with incident decline in physical function among older adults and may, therefore, be particularly important to functionally compromised patients hip fracture patients. Serum concentrations of α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol, the 2 major forms of vitamin E, were assessed in 148 female hip fracture patients 65 years or older from the Baltimore Hip Studies cohort 4 around the time of fracture (baseline) and at 2, 6, and 12 month postfracture follow-up visits (recovery). It was hypothesized that mean concentrations of both forms of vitamin E among these hip fracture patients would be lowest at the baseline visit and increase at each study visit during the year after fracture. Linear regression and generalized estimating equations were used to assess changes in vitamin E concentrations after adjustment for covariates and to determine predict…
28473200	Thermal desorption comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to variable-energy electron ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for monitoring subtle changes in volatile organic compound profiles of human blood.	aging	2017-06-09	Blood is a matrix with high potential for forensic investigations and human rescue. Its volatile signature can be used in search exercises to locate injured or deceased individuals. Little is known, however, about the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of blood, except that it is complex and varies while blood ages. In the present study, we used thermal desorption (TD) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) coupled to variable-energy electron ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) to monitor VOC signatures of human blood. A highly complex reference standard (Century Mix) containing 108 compounds of various chemical functionalities and several homologue series of compounds was used for the purpose of transposing our previously developed cryogenically modulated GCxGC-TOFMS methods into the use of a reverse fill/flush (RFF) flow modulator. The average peak width at half height was 340ms and the average tailing factor was 1.16. Light VOCs (down to C)…
17130688	Cumulative lead exposure and cognitive performance among elderly men.	aging	2007-01-??	BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that cumulative lead exposure among adults in nonoccupational settings can adversely affect cognitive function. Which cognitive domains are affected has not been explored in detail.    METHODS: We used nonlinear spline regressions and linear repeated-measures analysis to assess the association between scores on a battery of cognitive tests over time and both blood and bone lead concentrations in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort of community-dwelling elderly men. Bone lead was measured from 1991 through 1999 with K-shell x-ray fluorescence. A total of 1089 men with a mean (+/-standard deviation) age of 68.7 (+/-7.4) years with blood lead measurements, 761 of whom also had valid bone lead measurements, completed at least one of a battery of cognitive tests. Approximately 3.5 years later, 69% of the men had at least one repeat test. Cognitive testing was performed from 1993 through 2001.    RESULTS: On a cross-sectional basis, there was little assoc…
22340818	Echocardiography, natriuretic peptides, and risk for incident heart failure in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study.	aging	2012-02-??	OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the potential utility of echocardiography and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for heart failure (HF) risk stratification in concert with a validated clinical HF risk score in older adults.    BACKGROUND: Without clinical guidance, echocardiography and natriuretic peptides have suboptimal test characteristics for population-wide HF risk stratification. However, the value of these tests has not been examined in concert with a clinical HF risk score.    METHODS: We evaluated the improvement in 5-year HF risk prediction offered by adding an echocardiographic score and/or NT-proBNP levels to the clinical Health Aging and Body Composition (ABC) HF risk score (base model) in 3,752 participants of the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) (age 72.6 ± 5.4 years; 40.8% men; 86.5% white). The echocardiographic score was derived as the weighted sum of independent echocardiographic predictors of HF. We assessed changes in Bayesian informati…
11249925	Antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde levels related to aging.	aging	2001-03-??	BACKGROUND: Free oxygen radicals have been proposed as important causative agents of aging. We have evaluated age-related changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation.    METHODS: We measured erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. One hundred and seventy six healthy subjects were divided into five groups: Group 1 (n = 25; 0.2-1 year-old), Group 2 (n = 28; 2-11 years), Group 3 (n = 23: 12-24 years), Group 4 (n = 40; 25-40 years), Group 5 (n = 60: 41-69 years).    RESULTS: SOD activities in Group 5 were significantly lower than in the other groups (P < 0.001). GPx and CAT activities and MDA levels in Group 5 were significantly higher than the other groups (P < 0.001, respectively). CAT activity in Group 4 was significantly higher than group 1 and group 2 (respectively, P < 0.001), and in group 3 was high compared to Group 2 (P < 0.001). There were negative correlations between SOD ac…
20650446	Evaluation of three methodologies to estimate the VO2max in people of different ages.	aging	2010-12-??	Aging and gender are factors that affect the variation of physical work capacity. The present paper highlights the importance of the metabolism used by ergonomics to establish the appropriate limits of loads at work. This study compares the aerobic capacity of people from 20 to 71 years old split in 5 different groups. The laboratory experiment tested 33 volunteers (19 women and 14 men). A submaximal step test was used to measure the VO(2) using a portable breath by breath metabolic system and a telemetric heart rate monitor. Three methods to estimate the VO(2max) were compared: 1) a direct measurement of VO(2), 2) estimation by heart rate, and 3) a step test method using predetermined charts. Significant difference was encountered among the estimation methods as well as among the age ranges (F(2,92)=6.43, p<0.05 y F(4,92)=7.18, p<0.05 respectively). The method of direct measurement and the method of predetermined charts were different for the estimation of the VO(2max) with a confiden…
30707652	Memory Self-Efficacy and Beliefs about Memory and Aging in Oldest-Old Adults in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study (LHAS).	aging	2019-01-??	Background/Study Context. Adaptation to normative age-related declines in memory is an important but understudied aspect of successful aging. The purpose of the present study was to shed new light on memory self-efficacy and beliefs about memory and aging as two integral aspects of adult cognition with relevance to successful aging.**METHODS:****Young (19 to 27 years) and community-dwelling older adults (60 to 94 years) from the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study (LHAS) completed an adapted Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) which includes a memory self-efficacy subscale, the Memory Controllability Inventory (MCI), and the Aging Concerns Scale (ACS).**RESULTS:****Nonagenarians' self-reported memory and beliefs about memory and aging were of central interest. We compared their responses to three younger reference groups to examine hypothesized differences in self-reported memory and beliefs about memory and aging in very late life. Results yielded age effects for most of the MFQ and MCI …

Absorption of the dietary components of vitamin A, retinol and beta-carotene, was found to be slightly more efficient in the aging gut. Postprandial clearance of retinyl esters from the circulation was significantly slower in older than in younger subjects.
30300464	Evaluation of Nutritional Compositions, Bioactive Compounds, and Antioxidant Activities of Shanxi Aged Vinegars During the Aging Process.	aging	2018-10-??	Shanxi aged vinegar (SAV) is known as famous fermented food in China. During the brewing process, a large number of nutritional substances and bioactive compounds are produced, which have beneficial effects on human body. In this study, the contents of nutritional compositions including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids were determined in SAV samples. The antioxidant compounds and properties of SAV with different aging time were also evaluated. The results showed that the contents of proteins, crude fats, and carbohydrates in SAV were not changed with the aging time. Moreover, Alanine was the main component of amino acids in SAV, and the total contents of amino acids were increased with the aging time. Acetic acid and lactic acid were the predominant organic acids in SAV. The contents of acetic acid and lactic acid accounted for more than 90% of the total organic acids in SAV, which were increased during the aging process of 5 years. Furthermore, total pheno…
28462727	A prospective evaluation of the depression-nutrient intake reverse causality hypothesis in a cohort of community-dwelling older Canadians.	aging	2017-04-??	Studies have investigated the potential protective effects that diet may have on late-life depression incidence. This disorder can, however, affect the person's food intake, widely known as the reverse causality hypothesis of depression. To test this hypothesis, we compared mean nutrient intakes from three 24-h recalls during the year depression was detected (Geriatric Depression Scale ≥11 or antidepressant medication) with intakes from 1 year earlier among community-dwelling older adults (67-83 years) followed up annually in the 4-year Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging, who were free of depression and cognitive impairment at baseline. Participants (n 158, 64·4 % female) who became depressed and had data available for all follow-up years were matched by age group and sex with non-depressed participants. General linear mixed models were adjusted for percentage changes in physical activity, functional autonomy and stressful life events reported at the time of positive scre…
566404	The biology of human spermatozoa.	aging	1978-??-??	PIP: This article summarizes the basic aspects of the biology of spermatozoa, not the clinical aspects, and the discussion focuses first on the structure and biochemistry of sperm and then follows the germ cell from its inception (spermatogenesis) to its final destination (fusion with the ovum). Figures accompany the textual discussion of the characteristics of sperm cells. Structure of sperm is broken down into sperm head (nucleus, acrosome and postnuclear cap, and neck) and the sperm tail (flagellum, fibrous sheath, and midpiece). Then follows a section on the biochemistry and motility of sperm with the biochemical constituents of each part of the structure outlined. The process of spermatogenesis is described, sperm maturation and epididymal function are discussed, storage, aging, and transport of sperm in th male genital tract are explained, and the characteristics of the ejaculate are emphasized (liquefaction). Next, the transport of sperm in the female genital tract is discussed,…
29538798	Influence of Tannin Extract and Yeast Extract on Color Preservation and Anthocyanin Content of Mulberry Wine.	aging	2018-04-??	The color of mulberry wine is extremely unstable in processing and aging. This paper investigates the effects of tannin extract and yeast extract on the color and color-preserving characteristics of mulberry wine made from the Dashi cultivar. The results showed that the maximum absorption wavelength in both tannin extract and yeast extract groups changed generating the red shift effect. The color of the tannin extract maintained a good gloss in the first 4 months, while the yeast extract group showed remarkable color preservation for the first 3 months. The total anthocyanin and cyanidin-3-rutinoside contents in both experiment groups were significantly higher than that of the control group, thus proving that tannin extract and yeast extract both exert a remarkably positive effect on preserving the color of mulberry wine during its aging. Moreover, sensory analysis indicated that the quality of mulberry wine treated with tannin extract was significantly higher than that of the control.…
