28758339	Mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 shift metabolism to mitochondrial respiration during aging.	lifespan, aging	Replicative and chronological lifespan are two different modes of cellular aging. Chronological lifespan is defined as the duration during which quiescent normal cells retain their capacity to re-enter the proliferative cycle. This study investigated whether changes in metabolism occur during aging of quiescent normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) and the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Bioenergetics measurements were taken in quiescent NHFs from younger (newborn, 3-day, 5-month, and 1-year) and older (58-, 61-, 63-, 68-, and 70-year) healthy donors as well as NHFs from the same individual at different ages (29, 36, and 46 years). Results show significant changes in cellular metabolism during aging of quiescent NHFs: Old NHFs exhibit a significant decrease in glycolytic flux and lactate levels, and increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP levels compared to young NHFs. Results from the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test show that old NHFs with a lower Bioenergetic Health Ind…
28624737	Optical properties of the human lens constituents.	aging	The absorption and fluorescence properties of the metabolomic (MET), water-soluble and urea-soluble protein fractions from the middle-age, aged, and cataractous human lenses have been measured. At 280nm and 300nm the major lens absorbers are crystallins, which absorb more than 90% of light in the UV-B region (280-315nm). In middle-aged lenses, the absorption at 360nm is mostly provided by UV filters contained in the MET fraction. With aging, and especially with the cataract development, the absorption of MET fraction in UV-A region (315-400nm) decreases due to the drop of the UV filter concentration, while the absorption of protein fractions increases due to the accumulation of post-translational modifications. Consequently, the contribution of the MET fraction into the total lens absorption at 360nm decays from 63% in middle-aged lenses to 25% in aged lenses to 3% in cataractous lenses. The fluorescence yield of the MET fraction from cataractous lenses also significantly increases. Th…
22834969	Human serum metabolic profiles are age dependent.	aging	Understanding the complexity of aging is of utmost importance. This can now be addressed by the novel and powerful approach of metabolomics. However, to date, only a few metabolic studies based on large samples are available. Here, we provide novel and specific information on age-related metabolite concentration changes in human homeostasis. We report results from two population-based studies: the KORA F4 study from Germany as a discovery cohort, with 1038 female and 1124 male participants (32-81 years), and the TwinsUK study as replication, with 724 female participants. Targeted metabolomics of fasting serum samples quantified 131 metabolites by FIA-MS/MS. Among these, 71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in women/men (BMI adjusted). We further identified a set of 13 independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6 × 10(-04) to 7.8 × 10(-42) , α(corr) = 0.004). Eleven of these 13 metabolites were replicated in the TwinsUK study, including seven meta…
3299702	Human aging: usual and successful.	aging	Research in aging has emphasized average age-related losses and neglected the substantial heterogeneity of older persons. The effects of the aging process itself have been exaggerated, and the modifying effects of diet, exercise, personal habits, and psychosocial factors underestimated. Within the category of normal aging, a distinction can be made between usual aging, in which extrinsic factors heighten the effects of aging alone, and successful aging, in which extrinsic factors play a neutral or positive role. Research on the risks associated with usual aging and strategies to modify them should help elucidate how a transition from usual to successful aging can be facilitated.
29266515	Altered macromolecular pattern and content in the aging human brain.	aging	The resonances originating from proteins underlie those of metabolites in brain  H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. These resonances have different physical properties from those of metabolites, such as shorter T and T relaxation time constants. The age dependence of the macromolecular pattern and content in the human brain was investigated with a focus on adults over 66 years of age using ultrahigh-field in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Eighteen young and 23 cognitively normal older adults were studied at 7 T. Metabolite spectra were acquired in the occipital cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex with single-voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) spectroscopy in 14 young and 20 older adults. Macromolecular spectra were acquired in the occipital cortex using an inversion recovery STEAM sequence in four young and three older adults. The macromolecular pattern was apparent over the 0.5-4.5-ppm range in the inversion recovery spectra and the 0.5-2-ppm range in…
26198148	Noncoding Transcriptional Landscape in Human Aging.	aging	Aging is a universal phenomenon in metazoans, characterized by a general decline of the organism physiology associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Aging of an organism correlates with a decline in function of its cells, as shown for muscle, immune, and neuronal cells. As the DNA content of most cells within an organism remains largely identical throughout the life span, age-associated transcriptional changes must be achieved by epigenetic mechanisms. However, how aging may impact on the epigenetic state of cells is only beginning to be understood. In light of a growing number of studies demonstrating that noncoding RNAs can provide molecular signals that regulate expression of protein-coding genes and define epigenetic states of cells, we hypothesize that noncoding RNAs could play a direct role in inducing age-associated profiles of gene expression. In this context, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of gene expression might be important for …
27988482	Toward a More Comprehensive Concept of Successful Aging: Disability and Care Needs.	aging	Rowe and Kahn's model of Successful Aging 2.0 argues that changing environmental settings, societal policies, and individual life styles will lead to a significant extension of healthy life years. Recent epidemiological research, however, confirms the dilemma that the ongoing extension of life expectancy prolongs not only the years in good health but also those in poor health. We see it as a major limitation that Rowe and Kahn's model is not able to cover the emerging linkage between increasing life expectation and aging with disability and care needs. Therefore, we suggest a set of propositions towards a more comprehensive model of successful aging which captures desirable living situations including for those who grow old with disabilities and care needs. We describe individual, environmental, and care related strategies and resources for autonomy and quality of life when facing disabilities and care needs in late life, putting emphasis on inter-individual differences and social ineq…
26511272	Aging in Precarious Circumstances: Do Positive Views on Aging Make a Difference?	aging	Purpose of the study: Precariousness, defined as low income combined with lack of security for retirement, can influence the way people grow old and result in health inequalities in old age.    Design and methods: A sequential mixed methods approach was used to identify differences in behavioral (physical activity), social (social network), and psychological resources (positive views on aging) that middle-aged individuals from both precarious and financially secure backgrounds use in preparation for positive aging and keep high levels of health and well-being. It was investigated whether positive views on aging can compensate the detrimental association of a lack of resources with health and well-being in midlife. Data from the German Aging Survey (N = 1,992 in the secure group, N = 240 in the precarious group) were analyzed to understand the relationship between resources on the one hand and health and well-being on the other, as well as to compare the strategies of individuals with p…
25620575	A new hypothesis of aging.	longevity, lifespan, aging	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: There are over 300 hypotheses of aging, but none of them has enough predictive power to explain most experiments and observations on this process. On the basis of a critical analysis of the most relevant data on aging, especially on the factors that influences its rhythm, we present a new hypothesis, as well as the way the hypothesis' predictions explain some of the phylogenetic implications of the aging process.    METHODS: The hypothesis starts from a new, biochemical view on evolution and the behavior of living matter. According to this view, life is a fabric of chemical reactions that sustain each other. Reactants and energy support are needed for these reactions to take place in a cell. Given this, aging stems from a leftward shift of the global equilibrium of some biochemical reactions involved in cell differentiation and repair, which take place at a high level during the organism's growth period. In time, for species with evident aging, some reactions los…
24155214	Motor function is associated with 1,25(OH)(2)D and indices of insulin-glucose dynamics in non-diabetic older adults.	aging	BACKGROUND: Advancing age is accompanied by changes in metabolic characteristics, such as reduced insulin sensitivity and low levels of vitamin D, which may exacerbate age-related declines in physical function.    AIMS: The aim of the present study was to determine the associations between insulin-glucose dynamics, vitamin D metabolites, and performance on a battery of motor tasks in healthy, non-diabetic older adults.    METHODS: Sixty-nine community-dwelling men and women (65-90 years) were recruited. Insulin-glucose dynamics were determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and vitamin D metabolites were measured. Motor function was characterized by the time to walk 500 m, chair-rise time, lower body strength, dorsiflexor steadiness and endurance time, and muscle coactivation.    RESULTS: Significant unadjusted correlations were found between insulin-glucose dynamics and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] with walk time, strength, steadiness, endurance time, and muscle act…
26463762	Energetics of Aging and Frailty: The FRADEA Study.	aging	BACKGROUND: Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) decrease with aging, but it is not known whether frailty modulates this association. We hypothesize that RMR and TDEE values are similar between younger and older nonfrail older adults, whereas they are lower in older prefrail and frail compared with younger adults.    METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the FRADEA study, Albacete (Spain), including 402 participants (213 women) older than 70 years (mean age 76 years; range 70-91), was conducted. Estimated RMR (eRMR), oxygen consumption (VO2), expired volume (Ve), and respiratory frequency (RF) were determined using indirect calorimetry; TDEE was determined with the Calcumed instrument; and fat-free mass was determined by bioimpedanciometry. General linear models were used for analysis.    RESULTS: Mean TDEE was 1,889 (SD 470) kcal and eRMR was 1,071 (SD 323) kcal. Both TDEE (B = -24 kcal/day; 95% confidence interval: -35.4 to -14.2; p < .001) and eRMR…
28111190	Increased sensitivity to age-related differences in brain functional connectivity during continuous multiple object tracking compared to resting-state.	aging	Age-related differences in cognitive agility vary greatly between individuals and cognitive functions. This heterogeneity is partly mirrored in individual differences in brain network connectivity as revealed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggesting potential imaging biomarkers for age-related cognitive decline. However, although convenient in its simplicity, the resting state is essentially an unconstrained paradigm with minimal experimental control. Here, based on the conception that the magnitude and characteristics of age-related differences in brain connectivity is dependent on cognitive context and effort, we tested the hypothesis that experimentally increasing cognitive load boosts the sensitivity to age and changes the discriminative network configurations. To this end, we obtained fMRI data from younger (n=25, mean age 24.16±5.11) and older (n=22, mean age 65.09±7.53) healthy adults during rest and two load levels of continuous multiple obje…
26973114	Object individuation and compensation in healthy aging.	aging	Theories on neural compensation suggest that aged participants overactivate the brain areas involved in a task to compensate for the age-related decline. In this electrophysiological study, we investigated the temporal locus of neural overactivation in aging during multiple target processing. We measured performance and three event-related brain potential responses (N1, N2pc, and contralateral delay activity) in young and old adults, while they enumerated a variable number (1-4) of targets presented in an easy (distractor absent) or difficult (distractor present) condition. The main results indicated that although N2pc (∼200 ms) increased in amplitude in the distractor-present condition in the young group, no modulation occurred for the old group. Old participants were associated with larger N2pc amplitudes than young participants in the distractor-absent condition, where both groups had comparable levels of accuracy. These effects were not present for N1 and contralateral delay activi…
29244847	Cognitive failures in late adulthood: The role of age, social context and depressive symptoms.	aging	The incidence of self-reported cognitive failures among older adults may be an index of successful cognitive aging. However, self-reported cognitive failures are biased by variation in depressive symptomatology. This study examined age-related and socio-cultural context effects on cognitive failures while controlling for depressive symptoms. Both overall and specific factors of cognitive failures were determined. A further goal was to investigate the relationship between working memory and cognitive efficiency measures and cognitive failures. One hundred and thirty-nine cognitively healthy adults were recruited from two populations known to differ in their dispositions toward cognitive failures and depressive symptoms (Sardinia and northern Italy). The participants were assigned to Young Old (65-74 years old), Old (75-84 years of age) or Oldest Old (≥85 years of age) groups, and individually presented with a test battery including the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Centre for Ep…
28872043	Representations of their own sexuality and aging body by old people: phenomenological and psychodynamic approach.	aging	The sexuality of the elderly is rarely mentioned in general medicine although it holds an important place in many old people's life, and sexual well-being is a part of the global well-being according to the World Health Organization. To explore the representations of their own sexuality and aging body by the elderly. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in 15 healthy elderly people over 65 years of age, living at home. In-depth interviews were transcribed and submitted to qualitative content using a phenomenological and a psychodynamic analysis. The phenomenological approach allows to explore the meaning and significance of the sexuality of older people (their representations and individual experience). The psychodynamic approach allows an analysis of defense mechanisms in verbal and nonverbal behavior. Some elderly maintain a view of their sexuality in accordance with the societal standards existing before the sexual liberalization following the events of May 68 in Franc…
24457528	Serum profiling of healthy aging identifies phospho- and sphingolipid species as markers of human longevity.	aging	As centenarians well represent the model of healthy aging, there are many important implications in revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms behind such successful aging. By combining NMR metabonomics and shot-gun lipidomics in serum we analyzed metabolome and lipidome composition of a group of centenarians with respect to elderly individuals. Specifically, NMR metabonomics profiling of serum revealed that centenarians are characterized by a metabolic phenotype distinct from that of elderly subjects, in particular regarding amino acids and lipid species. Shot- gun lipidomics approach displays unique changes in lipids biosynthesis in centenarians, with 41 differently abundant lipid species with respect to elderly subjects. These findings reveal phospho/sphingolipids as putative markers and biological modulators of healthy aging, in humans. Considering the particular actions of these metabolites, these data are suggestive of a better counteractive antioxidant capacity and a well-dev…
30411727	Normal patterns of regional brain <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in normal aging.	aging	OBJECTIVE: Normal aging alters the brain function even in the absence of recognizable structural changes, which can be detected using modern in vivo functional imaging modalities such as fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET) scan. It is highly important to recognize normal age-dependent changes in order to correctly diagnose pathologic states. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the age-related changes in regional brain F-FDG uptake in normal healthy population.    SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was part of the cardiovascular molecular calcification assessed by F-sodium fluoride (NaF) (CAMONA) PET/computed tomography (CT) study. This study was approved by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01724749). Forty normal healthy subjects were prospectively recruited in group A (22-32 years) and B (56-75 years) and underwent F-FDG PET/CT. Static images were obtained 180 minutes following F-FD…
25468185	Social cognition in schizophrenia and healthy aging: differences and similarities.	aging	UNLABELLED: Social cognition is impaired in schizophrenia but it is not clear whether this is specific for the illness and whether emotion perception is selectively affected. To study this we examined the perception of emotional and non-emotional clues in facial expressions, a key social cognitive skill, in schizophrenia patients and old healthy individuals using young healthy individuals as reference. Tests of object recognition, visual orientation, psychomotor speed, and working memory were included to allow multivariate analysis taking into account other cognitive functions    RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients showed impairments in recognition of identity and emotional facial clues compared to young and old healthy groups. Severity was similar to that for object recognition and visuospatial processing. Older and younger healthy groups did not differ from each other on these tests. Schizophrenia patients and old healthy individuals were similarly impaired in the ability to automaticall…
28510785	The impact of leisure on mental health of Sardinian elderly from the 'blue zone': evidence for ageing well.	longevity	BACKGROUND: There has been scientific interest in the Sardinia population for a number of years and for a variety of reasons, including its extreme longevity. This is especially prevalent in the central-eastern region of the island, where a blue zone region has been precisely delineated.    AIMS: The present study examines the influence of leisure activities on psychological well-being and depressive symptoms in elderly individuals living in the blue zone region of inner Sardinia.    METHODS: Eighty-three participants were recruited according to strict inclusion criteria to ensure their cognitive and residency status. Individuals were assigned to either old (70-79 years) or very old (≥80 years) groups, and were administered a test battery to determine their socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, perceived physical health, and self-perceived well-being and depressive symptoms.    RESULTS: The primary findings indicate that participation in leisure activities positively influen…
23273984	The aging ovary--the poor granulosa cells.	aging	The development of a competent oocyte intimately depends on the maintenance of energetic homeostasis in the ovarian and follicular microenvironment. On this basis, it is very likely that the oocyte ages as the ovary ages. Starting from the molecular evidence for energy perturbations in the whole ovary, we review current knowledge on the involvement of endogenous highly reactive metabolites in follicle aging. The first part provides an update of recent findings that confirm the key role of oxidative stress in aged granulosa cells. The second part focuses on studies providing evidence for the implication of advanced glycation end product (AGE) in aging reproductive dysfunction. With their prolonged half-life and ability to act as signaling molecules AGEs may gradually accumulate in the ovary and potentiate the wide spatiotemporal spread of oxidative stress. Clinical evidence for this view supports the hypothesis that AGE is a good candidate as a predictive marker and therapeutic target i…
24793646	Antecedents of Attitudes to Aging: A Study of the Roles of Personality and Well-being.	aging	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Little research has examined factors that contribute to the formation of attitudes toward one's own aging. The current study aimed to examine personality as defined by the Five-Factor model of personality as an antecedent of attitudes, while taking into account demographic and health factors known to be relevant to such attitudes.    DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants aged 60 years or older (N = 421) were part of a longitudinal study of health and well-being in Australia, and completed a postal survey comprising measures of personality, the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire, the SF-12 health survey, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale.    RESULTS: Higher levels of neuroticism were associated with less positive attitudes toward old age as a time of psychological growth, and higher extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of less negative attitudes toward psychosocial loss. Baseline measures of self-reported mental and physical health, as well as ch…
28982708	The Reduction of Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Gray Matter Volume Correlates with Loss of Economic Rationality in Aging.	aging	The population of people above 65 years old continues to grow, and there is mounting evidence that as humans age they are more likely to make errors. However, the specific effect of neuroanatomical aging on the efficiency of economic decision-making is poorly understood. We used whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis to determine where reduction of gray matter volume in healthy female and male adults over the age of 65 years correlates with a classic measure of economic irrationality: violations of the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference. All participants were functionally normal with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ranging between 26 and 30. While our elders showed the previously reported decline in rationality compared with younger subjects, chronological age per se did not correlate with rationality measures within our population of elders. Instead, reduction of gray matter density in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex correlates tightly with irrational behavior. Intere…
29654977	Identification of Isomeric Aspartate residues in βB2-crystallin from Aged Human Lens.	aging	Many post-translational modifications such as oxidation, deamidation and isomerization of amino acid residues occur in lens proteins with aging. One such modification, isomerization of aspartate in lens α-crystallin, has been well studied by amino acid enantiomer analysis and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS can quickly and easily identify D- and L-amino acid-containing peptides without purification of lens protein mixtures. However, this method has a weak point in that isomeric peptides of major components are detected predominantly, while those from minor proteins such as β- and γ-crystallins have not been fully determined. Therefore, the isomerization of amino acid residues in β- and γ-crystallin families has been little studied. To solve those problems and detect the isomerization of Asp residues in lens βB2-crystallin, the main component of the β-crystallin family, here we have developed steps for sample fractionation before d/l analysis based on either LC-MS/MS or amino acid derivatization to …
